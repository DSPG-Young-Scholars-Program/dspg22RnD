14,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Primary FSGS is a serious renal disease, accounting for nearly 10-15% of all pediatric and adult patients requiring chronic dialysis or transplantation. Not only is the incidence of this disease rising, especially in select ethnic groups such as Blacks and Hispanics, the etiology of FSGS remains obscure and there is no proven therapy that is safe and well tolerated. In response to this urgent situation, a national multicenter NIDDK-funded randomized clinical trial is underway to compare the efficacy of cyclosporine, the current standard of care, with a combination of MMF and oral dexamethasone pulses in patients with steroid-resistant FSGS. It is anticipated that a significant number of patients will be ineligible for this trial because of prior treatment with one of the test therapies or will fail to respond to the experimental treatment. Children and young adults with FSGS who fail to respond to therapy have a high risk of developing end stage renal disease. The disease progression is always accompanied by increasing scarring and fibrosis within the kidney parenchyma. There is a critical need to develop novel therapies to treat these refractory patients. This proposal will evaluate the safety and efficacy of three novel agents that may have the capacity to reduce renal fibrosis and slow the rate of deterioration of disease in patients with resistant FSGS. This Phased Innovation Award application is composed of two distinct sections. During the initial stage, the R21 Phase, the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetic profile of two novel therapies - a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha antagonist) and a peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma, (PPARgamma) agonist will be tested. In the second stage, the R33 phase, a randomized Phase II clinical trial will be performed to assess the efficacy of the TNF-alpha antagonist adalumimab, the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone, an anti-TGF-beta antibody GC1008, and optimal conservative medical therapy. The outcome of this study will guide the design of a formal Phase III randomized clinical trial. The infrastructure that is established for the performance of this R21/R33 project should prove useful for the efficient assessment of additional novel therapies that will be developed in the future for patients with primary FSGS."
32,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for effective analgesic agents with minimal respiratory depressant effects and low addiction potential is profound. Approximately 34 million Americans suffer from chronic pain; 40 percent of those pain patients have found their treatment to be inadequate. Many cannot tolerate morphine, or the escalated doses of other mu agonists required to maintain a pain-free state over time. This problem is even more pronounced in neuropathic pain patients that require much higher doses of mu opioid agonists. By understanding the mechanisms of action of the endogenous neurotransmitters that modulate nociceptive sensitivity, we can develop more effective analgesic agents for the treatment of pain. Orphanin FQ/nociceptin (OFQ/N) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that produces both anti-analgesic and analgesic effects and has no addiction potential. OFQ/N is also anti-allodynic - making the receptor for OFQ/N, ORL1, a therapeutic target for treatment of neuropathic pain. OFQ/N is implicated in the development of morphine tolerance as chronic morphine treatment increases levels of OFQ/N and ORLI. Moreover, blockade of OFQ/N binding to ORL1 attenuates the development of morphine tolerance. ORL1 receptors are colocalized with mu receptors on many cell populations in the descending analgesic pathway, and cross talk between ORL1 and mu opioid receptors would explain many of the anti-analgesic actions of OFQ/N. Unfortunately, understanding of the cellular regulation of the ORL1 receptor is very limited. Our studies indicate that ORL1 desensitization requires activation of PKC and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK). We hypothesize that ORL1 desensitization is dependent on ORL1 phosphorylation, and that this phosphorylation induces ORL1 internalization. We will determine the role, mechanism and site of phosphorylation responsible for ORL1 desensitization (aim 1) and internalization (aim 2). OFQ/N desensizition of mu receptor responses in neuronal cell lines, natively expressing both ORL1 and mu opioid receptors, involves PKC and GRK, while mu agonist-mediated desensitization of ORL1 requires only GRK. Therefore, this proposal will also study the mechanism(s) by which OFQ/N desensitizes the mu opioid receptor (aim 3), and by which mu agonists desensitize ORL1 (aim 4).By providing new information on the actions and interactions of OFQ/N and the mu opioid system, we can develop new drugs for the treatment of pain and improve the lives of millions."
131,HHS,HHS,"T cell activation and differentiation is dependent on TCR engagement of antigen and cooperating signalsprovided by several distinct receptor-ligand systems. The herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), a TNFsuperfamily member, engages LIGHT initiating costimulatory signals to T cells, yet HVEM also engages Band T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), an Ig superfamily member that provides an inhibitory signal to T cells.Substantial progress indicates that HVEM acts as a molecular switch between positive and inhibitorycosignaling in T cells. Moreover, the HVEM-BTLA system counter acts the closely related LTa(3-LT|3Rsystem, which together regulates the homeostasis and expansion of specific subsets of dendritic cells inlymphoid organs. Thus understanding the regulatory mechanisms of this cytokine network should providenew insight into controlling immune responses. We found that LIGHT in either its membrane or solubleposition modifies the binding of HVEM to BTLA, thus the mechanisms controlling the cellularcompartmentalization of LIGHT may influence inhibitory signaling by BTLA. We propose to examine howvarious forms of LIGHT modulate the HVEM-BTLA interaction. Specifically how soluble ligands andpolymorphic variants of LIGHT modify activation of BTLA. In addition, polymorphic variants of human LIGHTwill be examined for their influence on LIGHT shedding and the enzyme involved in cleavage of membraneLIGHT will be identified using an expression cloning strategy. We will explore whether analogous pathwaysto HVEM-BTLA exist for other TNFR containing the conserved BTLA binding domain. HVEM-BTLA acts at apostmitotic step to limit dendritic cell expansion. The attenuation of death receptor signaling will be examinedas one mechanism mediating the inhibitory affect of HVEM-BTLA on dendritic cell homeostasis using mouseand human models. These plans will provide a mechanistic understanding of how LTap and LIGHT signalsare integrated to orchestrate intercellular communication between T lymphocytes and dendritic cells duringimmune responses.Lay summary: Our research identified an important set of molecules, termed cytokines, that control howimmune cells communicate with each other. We demonstrated that altering the activity of these moleculeschanges the responses of cells. This research provides a new opportunity to modify the function of theimmune system in autoimmune and infectious diseases"
133,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to understand the neural mechanisms underlying communication and social behavior and related emotional and motivational states, particularly individual and kin recognition. A related goal of is to understand the neural mechanisms underlying these processes, especially the discovery of areas of the brain involved in social recognition and memory, emotional and motivational mechanisms related to recognition of familiar individuals and the consequent social behavior, and the sensory processes related to these abilities. The results will be relevant to understanding many types of mental and behavioral disorders that involve social interactions, such as autism and depression, personality disorders (e.g., antisocial, avoidant, paranoid or schizoid), social anxiety, social phobias and the effects of socially induced stress and post-traumatic stress. In addition, the findings will be relevant to disabilities due to stroke, head injury, or degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.  The specific aims of the study are to use our extensive knowledge about social behavior and communication in hamsters as a model system to investigate the neural mechanisms of recognition of individuals, kin, and sex by odors. There are three specific goals. (1) Using immunohistochemistry to identify cells expressing immediate early genes, we will identify brain areas activated during response to familiar individuals and appropriate emotional responses to them. (2) Using micro-infusion of lidocaine, we will determine which brain regions are necessary for individual and sex recognition and appropriate responses to such individuals. Brain areas of particular interest include the olfactory projection pathways, basolateral and medial amygdala, entorhinal cortex, peri-rhinal cortex, the hippocampus, and the subiculum. (3) The role of the main and accessory olfactory bulbs in processing information about individuals and kin and the role of social experiences in altering the patterns of activity in the bulb. These experiments will provide new and unique knowledge about the neural basis of social recognition, social memory, and the emotional and motivational responses caused by interactions with known individuals. These mechanisms are essential building blocks in the social behavior of non-human animals and humans."
144,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION:  Smoking is an important public health problem costing over 430,000 lives a year in this county alone. The first line-treatments, Nicotine Replacement Treatments (NRT) or bupropion, compared to placebo, approximately double the long-term success rate for smoking cessation. Given that there remains 46 million smokers in this country and over 70 percent of them interested in quitting smoking, development of new treatments for smoking cessation will have great public health implications. The primary aim of this proposal is to determine the utility of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system as a target for the treatment of tobacco dependence. This proposal is based on the findings of our pilot study, which examined the interactions between a selective GABA transporter inhibitor, tiagabine, and nicotine in overnight abstinent smokers.In our pilot study, tiagabine, compared to placebo, attenuated the ratings of  good effects  and  drug liking  from IV nicotine in overnight abstinent smokers. Tiagabine treatment also decreased craving for cigarettes and improved performance on a reaction time test in abstinent smokers. These findings suggest that enhancing the GABA system may attenuate the reinforcing effects of nicotine and craving for cigarettes. In addition, our findings raise an interesting possibility that enhancing the GABA system with tiagabine may improve cognitive performance in abstinent smokers. Thus, medications increasing synaptic GABA levels may have utility for the pharmacotherapy of tobacco dependence. In this proposal, we will examine dosedependent effects of a GABA enhancing medication, tiagabine, (0, 8 or 16 mg), on smoking behavior and reactivity to smoking cues using human laboratory models. We hypothesize that in abstinent male and female smokers, tiagabine at 16 mg, will be most effective in decreasing smoking behavior and attenuating reactivity to smoking cues. This proposal will use validated human laboratory models to systematically investigate the potential utility of a GABA enhancing agent, tiagabine, as a pharmacological treatment for smoking cessation. Our proposed study will also provide critical information relevant for further clinical studies: the optimum dose and possible mechanism of action of tiagabine for tobacco dependence. The findings of this study will provide valuable information to develop new pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation."
145,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation is the major risk factor for the induction and development of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) including squamous cell carcinoma (SCCs) and basal cell carcinoma (BCCs) which account for more than one million newly diagnosed human cancers annually in the USA. UVB causes structural alterations in DNA leading to hot spot mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and ptch in BCCs and in the perilesional skin surrounding these lesions. The pathogenesis of these tumors is thought to be driven by mutational activation of sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling and inactivation of p53 resulting in blockade of apoptosis and augmentation of cell proliferation and clonal expansion of initiated cells prompting the growth of BCCs. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that the combination of shh activation and p53 inhibition drives the neoplastic process in BCCs and that finding chemical agents targeted to blocking the effects of UVB on these signaling pathways will abrogate the development of these lesions. For this study we will employ genetically engineered cancer-susceptible murine models that mimic the phenotype of tumor-susceptible human skin. These include: ptc1+ hairless mice carrying p53+/+p53+/- or p53-/-; in prior studies we have shown that ptc1+/SKH1 hairless mice carrying p53+/+ spontaneously develop multiple human BCCs-like lesions in addition to rhabdomyosarcomas. Chronic UVB irradiation of the skin of these mice readily induces multiple tumors including papillomas, SCCs and BCCs, providing a uniquely relevant murine model of human skin cancer induction. In this murine model we will investigate effects of targeted anti-cancer agents including cyclopamine and CP-31398, which block shh activation and convert mutant p53 into a functionally active protein respectively. We will also assess the role of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), which is also induced by UVB irradiation of the skin, by using sulfasalazine that blocks NFkB activation by directly inhibiting IkB kinases. Employing LC-MS, we have shown that co-administration of cyclopamine and CP-31398 or sulfasalazine does not alter individual agent's bioavailability. It is our belief that these studies will form the basis for translational clinical trials whereby a suitable combination of these test agents could prove highly effective in abrogating BCCs and may provide a mechanism-based uniquely effective approach for the chemoprevention of NMSCs in susceptible human populations."
160,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis is the most prevalent illicit substance used by adolescents in the U.S. Although available treatments can help adolescent cannabis users achieve abstinence, longer term outcome studies have demonstrated high rates of relapse to cannabis use in this population. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that cannabis use exerts sustained disruptive effects on learning and memory, which appear to be more pronounced with earlier age at onset of cannabis use. Preclinical work has also provided evidence of neuroadaptive changes in reward circuitry, including reduced dopaminergic neurotransmission, following chronic exposure to ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active component of cannabis. Many treatments for adolescent cannabis abuse and dependence, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, and contingency management therapy, involve processing of rewards, learning new information, and retaining this new information over time. Understanding how exposure to cannabis during adolescent development alters the function of neurocircuitry that supports reward processing, learning and memory, and the integration of neurocircuits that support these cognitive functions is thus an important problem in addiction neuroscience. The goal of this proposal is to develop and refine a paradigm for the assessment of reward-motivated learning, and the function of neurocircuitry that supports reward-motivated learning, in adolescent cannabis users. Thirty-five adolescent cannabis users and 35 matched non-cannabis using comparison subjects will undergo behavioral assessment using four versions of a reward- motivated learning task that will test two levels of reward (high and low) and two stimuli types (verbal and nonverbal stimuli). Data collected from these assessments will be used to test the hypothesis that response to positive and negative rewards in the context of learning are blunted in adolescent cannabis users. The reward level and stimuli type found to be most sensitive to the effects of cannabis on reward-motivated learning in adolescents will be used to develop a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation paradigm. Fifteen adolescent cannabis users and 15 matched comparison subjects will undergo fMRI imaging with this paradigm to explore the effect of cannabis exposure on neurocircuitry that supports reward motivated learning and to estimate the size of this effect. All subjects will undergo four weeks of monitored abstinence from substances of abuse, other than nicotine, prior to behavioral and fMRI assessments. Cannabis use among adolescents is common. Although treatment can often help adolescents stop using cannabis in the short term, longer term follow-up studies have shown high rates of relapse to cannabis use among these teenagers. Studies of animals and of humans have shown that cannabis use disrupts learning and memory. Studies of animals have also shown that reward circuitry undergoes neuroadaptive changes in response to chronic exposure to the active component of cannabis,tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Many treatments for adolescent cannabis abuse and dependence involve processing of rewards, learning new information, and retaining this new information over time. The goal of this proposal is to develop and refine a paradigm for the assessment of reward-motivated learning, and the function of neurocircuitry that supports reward- motivated learning, in adolescent cannabis users. This work will form the foundation for future planned projects that will examine the relationship between the function of neurocircuitry supporting reward motivated learning and treatment outcome in adolescent cannabis users. Findings from these studies will provide a rational basis for tailoring treatment interventions to the ability of adolescents to respond to interventions that involve rewards (eg: contingency management) and/or learning (eg: cognitive-behavioral therapy), and to provide methods for monitoring changes in the function of neurocircuitry supporting reward-motivated learning associated with treatment and with sustained abstinence from cannabis use."
192,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to define in molecular terms the linkage between the oxidative modifications of proteins in the outer retina, their recognition by the immune system and the vulnerability of the outer retina to attack, leading to the disease processes underlying age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Work completed during the last grant period revealed that AMD eye tissues contain high levels of proteins modified by the adduction of oxidation fragments of the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Many of the proteins modified by this and other adducts are found in drusen and Bruch's membrane. Furthermore, autoantibodies against these unique carboxyethylpyrrole adducts (CEP) are more abundant in the circulation (plasma) of individuals with AMD than are found in age-matched individuals without AMD. From these results the following hypothesis has emerged regarding an initiating stimulus for AMD: (a). Because of the high concentration of DHA in the photoreceptors-RPE complex coupled with the vulnerability of DHA to oxidative damage, CEP-adducts are slowly generated over time in the outer retina, (b). These CEP-adducts represent new epitopes foreign to the immune system resulting in the generation of autoantibodies against CEP. (c). Anti-CEP-antibodies in turn are involved in activation of the complement attack pathway at the Bruch's membrane-RPE interface in response to the continued generation of CEP epitopes in tissues of the outer retina. To test this hypothesis we immunized normal mice with CEP-adducted mouse serum albumin. Our prediction was that systemic immunization with CEP would sensitize mice to endogenous CEP-adducted proteins generated in the outer retina during the normal course of aging. In turn the immune system would respond by attacking the cells where CEP epitopes are most readily generated. Analysis of these mice demonstrated focal lesions in the RPE and photoreceptors that mimic geographic atrophy, the blinding end-stage atrophy associated with dry AMD. This new mouse model for AMD will be further characterized in normal mice and the CEP-immunizations will be extended to mice with genetic defects in complement pathway molecules and their regulators. A new model for AMD in the mouse will be an important a new resource for use in the preclinical testing of therapeutics designed to prevent or limit the progression of AMD."
231,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research will highlight two central factors inadequately addressed in our understanding of the pathway from political violence, specifically torture, to differential mental health outcomes. First, the affirmative appraisal of control, such as through religious and political meaning, is hypothesized to reduce posttraumatic psychiatric morbidity. Second, neuroendocrine activity, specifically low cortisol levels, is hypothesized to associate inversely with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among trauma survivors. This study is a prospective longitudinal investigation of torture survivors in Nepal followed over an eighteen month period. One hundred torture survivors and fifty control participants will be assessed for PTSD symptoms, appraisal of controllability, physical health, and salivary cortisol levels. Ultimately, this research has relevance to prevention and intervention for mental health sequelae for Americans affected by poltical violence, foreign-born Americans who have fled political violence, and populations with endemic political violence."
251,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) The NS3 helicase is an essential constituent of the replication machinery from Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), which is a positive-strand RNA virus that represents a major threat to public health. NS3 is a multifunctional molecular motor that hydrolyzes nucleotide triphosphates during the unwinding of both DNA and RNA duplexes. It is a member of helicase superfamily 2 (SF2), and it belongs to the DExH/D subgroup of enzymes that are involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, RNA interference, translation, RNA degradation, and in many forms of viral replication. Despite the ubiquity of the DExH/D enzymes, their fundamental importance for viability of higher organisms, and their role in numerous human pathogens, there have been few studies on the molecular mechanisms for RNA unwinding and ribonucleoprotein remodeling by this family of proteins. Little is known about their nucleic acid specificity, their mode of translocation, the mechanism of strand displacement, or the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and work expended during unwinding. To address these issues, we propose to use NS3 as a model system for exploring the behavior of DExH/D proteins. It is an excellent prototype for numerous reasons: (a). NS3 has been structurally characterized and it is a phylogenetically typical of DExH/D member, (b). It is part of a large ribonucleoprotein machine that contains cofactors that modulate its behavior (like most DExH/D proteins), (c). It has a robust unwinding reaction that has been investigated qualitatively, (d). Information about NS3 is likely to be critical for the development HCV management strategies. We propose a comprehensive program for the biophysical characterization of NS3 helicase activity. We will examine behavior of the isolated NS3 enzyme and its properties in complex with modulatory cofactors NS4A and NS5B. DNA unwinding by NS3 will also be explored, as the reaction is mechanistically distinct and it may provide important insights into metabolic strategies of the virus. Experiments will be carried out by applying new pre-steady state kinetic methods that monitor the unwinding of combinatorial substrate libraries. This approach, together with coupled ATPase assays, studies on chemically modified duplex substrates, time-resolved footprinting and single molecule methods will allow us to characterize the microscopic behavior of NS3 in a variety of macromolecular contexts. The results will fundamentally extend our knowledge of helicase mechanism and facilitate the development of new HCV inhibitors."
327,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recombination between divergent genes and genomes occurs commonly in nature and generates new gene combinations that appear to be important in the evolution of virulence, as well as resistance to antibiotics and disease. However, we know surprisingly little about the frequency with which wide recombination or hybridization contributes to adaptive evolution or the evolutionary conditions required for the establishment of new hybrid gene combinations. Given the ever-increasing opportunities for contact and gene exchange between previously isolated organisms, and the possible negative consequence of these interactions for human health, it is important that we understand the principles that govern the outcomes of hybridization. The proposed research will address fundamental questions about the role of hybridization in evolution, the limits to ecological divergence, the efficacy of different kinds of chromosomal rearrangements as reproductive barriers, the proportion of genes under positive selection during speciation, the reconstruction of reticulate phylogenies, and the tempo of hybrid speciation. The research will be conducted using the wild, annual sunflowers (Helianthus) because this group is widely cited as a model system for the study of interspecific hybridization and its consequences. The experimental plan employs a broad array of approaches, ranging from classic selection experiments comparing the response to selection of hybrid and pure parental populations, to candidate gene mapping, to single nucleotide polymorphism analyses that will assess the scale of recombination between the parental genomes in hybrid lineages. The proposed work represents an important step toward understanding the contribution of hybridization to adaptive evolution and speciation."
337,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes viruses comprise a large family of complex, double-stranded DNA viruses, a number of which are serious human pathogens. Herpes DNA replication requires a group of virally encoded proteins, and is the target of several antiviral drugs. However, the mechanism of Herpes replication is remarkably complex and not well understood. The broad, long-term goal of these studies is to obtain a detailed biochemical understanding of the mechanisms of Herpes primase and polymerase, and how they function together to initiate the synthesis of new DNA strands. This knowledge will, in turn, substantially enhance our understanding of the mechanism by which Herpes viruses replicate their DNA. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. Obtain a detailed understanding of the role of UL8 during primer synthesis. Even though this protein is essential for Herpes replication, little is known about how it functions mechanistically. 2. Develop a detailed understanding of how primase decides whether or not to polymerize a NTP. Primase is an astoundingly inaccurate enzyme, yet it is very capable of discriminating against NTPs containing modified bases. These studies will elucidate the fidelity mechanisms that give rise to these unusual properties 3.  Determine how primase interacts with the sugar of a nucleotide and then synthesize potent and specific inhibitors of this enzyme. Insights obtained from the studies on primase fidelity (Aim 2) will be combined with the results of studies on the interaction of primase with sugar analogs to develop novel inhibitors. 4. Elucidate the mechanism of primase-coupled DNA polymerase activity. These studies will determine how primase and polymerase function together to initiate the synthesis of new DNA strands. 5. Determine how Herpes polymerase discriminates between correct and incorrect dNTPs.  Fidelity of DNA replication is one of the most fundamental issues facing DNA polymerases. These studies will determine how Herpes polymerase obtains fidelity during DNA replication. To accomplish these aims, steady state and pre-steady state kinetic approaches, photoactivateable crosslinking reagents, and DNA footprinting methodologies will be used. Additionally, a large number of novel nucleotides will be synthesized."
356,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is highly regulated and intricately integrated into mRNA biosynthesis. In an effort to understand the factors involved and their mechanisms of action, studies are proposed that will help understand the role of P-TEFb and TTF2 in controlling transcription elongation and to what extent RNA processing is functionally coupled to transcription. I. P-TEFb plays a key role in regulating the critical checkpoint to productive elongation that occurs shortly after initiation. The kinase activity of P-TEFb is in turn uniquely regulated by reversible association with an RNP which contains 7SK RNA and HEXIM1 or HEXIM2. Parameters affecting the formation and dissociation of the P-TEFb/7SK/HEXIM complex will be examined using methods in vitro and in vivo. Details of the function of P-TEFb on specific genes and globally over all genes will be gathered using nuclear run-on reactions coupled to array methods. II. Transcription is shut off during mitosis and the RNA Pol I and Pol II termination activity of TTF2 is required for mitotic repression of transcription elongation. The role of TTF2 in mitotic transcription repression will be further studied and potential roles in transcription coupled repair, and interphase transcription will be examined. Also the potential role of TFIIF and other elongation factors in controlling TTF2 activity during transcription will be investigated. III. The processing reactions needed to generate functional mRNAs occur in part during elongation and are influenced by the transcription process. Newly developed assays will be used to elucidate the details of the function of the human capping enzyme and the cap methyl transferase in the context of transcription. Finally, using a newly developed in vitro system we will determine the extent to which polyadenylation is functionally coupled to transcription elongation and termination. Most of the studies described are aimed at understanding basic processes controlling gene expression, but P-TEFb plays a major role in HIV gene expression and may be a target for AIDS therapy. Also because a drug in clinical trials for cancer therapy, flavopiridol, targets P-TEFb, the proposed studies are important."
372,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) kills thousands of people each year in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is caused by African trypanosomes transmitted by the tsetse fly. HAT transmission is complex; it requires mammalian and invertebrate hosts and involves domestic and wild reservoirs. No mammalian vaccines exist and therapeutic drugs have serious side effects with increasing resistance seen in patients. In contrast, reduction of tsetse populations is highly efficacious for disease control. However, the implementation of the tsetse control programs, which rely on traps and targets, have been difficult to sustain because they are not practical and require extensive community participation. A paratransgenic strategy has been developed which exploits the unique biology of tsetse and its maternally inherited bacterial symbionts. In this strategy, tsetse's mutualist symbiont Sodalis is harnessed to express trypanosome inhibitory molecules in tsetse's midgut to impair trypanosome transmission. Transgenic Sodalis bacterium conferring refractoriness may be driven into natural tsetse populations by cytoplasmic incompatibility phenomenon mediated by tsetse's symbiont, Wolbachia. We propose to investigate the biogeography of the human disease vector species, Glossina fuscipes fuscipes, its Trypanosoma parasite(s), and its Wolbachia and Sodalis symbionts. Using a combination of laboratory and field experiments, we will investigate the potential for a Wolbachia mediated gene-drive mechanism to aid in the application of paratransgenic flies. In addition, we will elucidate the basic genetic structure of this human disease vector population, for which no information exists. This information is necessary for the efficacious implementation and monitoring of either the traditional or novel control strategies. Knowledge obtained on symbiont biology, maternal linkage of tsetse's multiple symbionts, Wolbachia infection phenotype, potential strength of Wolbachia mediated drive, population genetics and epidemiological dynamics will provide the parameters needed to develop a mathematically based model framework. This model will allow us to test the predictive nature of the empirical data, design the optimal strategies for population control, and predict feasibility and robustness for the success of the replacement strategy. This interdisciplinary application will combine epidemiology, population genetics and modeling with model parameterization and verification from laboratory and field research."
376,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-range objective of this research is to establish broad range, accurate, and reliable theories about phonation that can be useful in establishing refined and applicable concepts and approaches for helping people with voice problems. This goal, of necessity, must develop, use, and refine widely effective models of phonation, and quantify the biomechanical, aerodynamic, and acoustic factors that control laryngeal function and voice quality. The objective of this application is to establish a firm understanding of the biomechanics, kinematics, aerodynamics, and acoustics of vocal fold oscillation, hemilarynx phonation, register shift, and vocal fold impact dynamics. This objective will be met through a unique combination of experimental and computational methods. In this research, an innovative combination of three complimentary models will be used. The three models are: excised larynx model, a mechanical larynx model, and a finite-element biophysical model. The results of this work will not only enhance our understanding of normal phonation, but will elucidate how vocal lesions develop and how disorders such as vocal fold paralysis disrupt vocal fold vibration, which in turn could provide insight into improved surgical and behavioral treatment of voice disorders. The specific aims for this funding period are: (1) To establish the control mechanisms for decoupling vocal fold oscillation; (2) To establish optimal conditions for hemilarynx oscillation; (3) To establish the control mechanisms for transition between chest and falsetto registers; and (4) To establish the biomechanical and aerodynamic factors that influence the potentially damaging dynamic pressures and internal and external tissue stresses. The outcome of this research project should provide significant guidance and understanding of important issues in phonation, namely, the control of vocal fold oscillation, hemilarynx phonation, register transition, and potentially damaging impact forces on the vocal fold."

397,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are critical in many physiological processes, including steroid biosynthesis, drug metabolism and activation, and xenobiotic degradation. Structural and dynamic information concerning these enzymes is critical for understanding their activity (typically hdryoxylation of unactivated carbons), and will play a vital role in predicting the behavior of inhibitors and substrates as a part of drug design. Despite the large numbers of P450 enzymes found in living organisms, relatively few have been crystallized, and methodology for rapid characterization of active sites of P450s and their interactions with substrates and inhibitors is lacking. This proposal describes the first application of high-resolution multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to P450 enzymes. Extensive sequential 1H, 15N and 13C resonance assignments have been made in cytochrome P450cam (CYP101). Residues in the active site of CYP101 can be rapidly distinguished by comparison of paramagnetic and diamagnetic forms of the enzyme. Active site resonances are observed only in the diamagnetic form. Assignments have been used to monitor the interactions of CP101 with its physiological redox partner and effector, putidaredoxin (Pdx). Based on these observations, a new model for effector activity of Pdx has been proposed.     During the next period of this project, the sequential assignments of CYP101 will be completed in multiple forms of the enzyme, local dynamics will be characterized as a function of oxidation state, substrate binding and effector binding in order to shed further light on the mechanism of  uncoupling , in which reducing equivalents are lost as superoxide, peroxide and water without turnover of substrate. Methodology for applying NMR to the characterization of active sites of other P450 enzymes will be tested, with CYP102 (cytochrome P450 BM-3) and CYP3A4, an important human P450, as test cases. Methodology developed during the current period for NMR structural characterization of metalloproteins will be further refined. This includes two-dimensional NMR methods that can be used near paramagnetic centers in proteins, and extraction of structural information from magnetic anisotropy data such as residual dipolar couplings and dipolar shifts."
404,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T lymphocytes (T cells) not only play very important roles in adaptive immunity against various pathogens and malignancies but also contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and allergic diseases. GATA-3 has emerged as a key transcription factor that controls the development and function of T cells. GATA-3 is not only essential for the development of the T cell lineage but also important for the production of T cell cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10. In addition, studies on genetically engineered mice over-expressing GATA-3 have implied that GATA-3 may have a broader effect on T cell biology. Therefore, a better understanding of the function and regulation of GATA-3 will significantly advance our knowledge about the initiation, maintenance, and cessation of immune responses, and greatly enhance our ability to manipulate the outcomes of many infectious, malignant, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of GATA-3 are poorly understood, and studies on the function of GATA-3 are markedly hampered by the lack of live animals carrying mature  GATA-3-deficient T cells. This grant application is designed to take advantage of the recently generated conditional GATA-3-deficient mice to study the regulatory role and mechanism of action of GATA-3 in later stages of T cell development (Aim 1) and in the function of various subsets of peripheral T cells (Aims 2 and 3). One attractive explanation for the broad range of function of GATA-3 in T cells is that GATA-3 is able to interact physically and functionally with various proteins. This possibility will be addressed with several in vitro approaches (Aim 4). In addition, a great effort will be dedicated to elucidating the molecular mechanisms mediating the cell type-specific expression of GATA-3 (Aim 5)."
422,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) dramatically improves the survival of patients with HIV. The effectiveness of HAART in routine care is determined by the success with which patients are able to follow certain crucial Steps of HIV Care, which includes 1) access outpatient care, 2) utilize care and treatment services, and 3) adhere to care. Yet even in the HAART era, about 40% of persons with HIV do not enter care within 6 months after diagnosis, and adherence remains a challenge at all levels. Studies to date have not been able to follow patients through the entire Steps of HIV Care. As a result, we do not have a clear understanding of why patients so poorly engage in care, or the clinical and societal consequences of inadequately following the Steps of HIV Care. This application is for innovative, preparatory services research. Three essential elements are needed to study the Steps of HIV Care: a validated model for the interaction of patient and health care system, validated instruments to measure key constructs, and a methodology to analyze these extremely complex data. We will achieve these elements in the context of a prospective observational cohort study of patients enrolled at the time of HIV diagnosis, followed every 3 months for 18 months. We will accomplish 3 aims: 1) Assess the relation of attitudes and beliefs about HIV disease and care over time and relate those attitudes and beliefs with success in following the Steps of HIV Care. 2) Validate a simple visual analogue scale-based instrument for assessing adherence to HAART in  patients newly starting HAART in routine care. 3) Test the robustness of latent growth curve analysis for modeling changes in attitudes and beliefs overtime, and non-recursive causal modeling with longitudinal data analysis techniques for assessing the impact of each component of the Steps of HIV Care model on health outcomes. These studies will allow us to identify modifiable factors for improving outcomes, and target the Step of HIV Care where interventions should be focused to maximize impact."
434,HHS,HHS,"Sensorineural deafness affects nearly half of adults over the age of 50. Primarily, sensorineural deafnessis caused by the accumulated loss of mechanosensory cells in the cochlea, the sensory hair cells, whichdifferentiate during embryogenesis and are not replaced. Adult non-mammalian vertebrates, in contrast, canregenerate lost sensory hair cells, but the signals that permit regeneration in these animals are unknown.We wish to investigate signals that may regulate sensory hair cell differentiation in the post-natal mammaliancochlea using a novel in vitro system. In this system mouse embryonic cochlear epithelial cells can survive,proliferate, and differentiate into sensory hair cells. We show here as preliminary data that purified neonatalsupporting cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle and express sensory hair cell markers in this assay.Through trial and error, we have identified BMP4 as a potential negative regulator of cell cycle entry bysupporting cells. This data is important for several reasons: first, BMP4 is expressed in the cochleae of bothbirds and mice, although in different populations; second, BMP4 is down-regulated in the regenerating aviancochlea, but probably not in mammals. Thus, our model provides a simple and testable hypothesis for whybirds might regenerate, but mammals do not. We propose experiments to determine the mechanism bywhich BMP4 might inhibit proliferation, whether BMP4 also plays a role in sensory hair cell differentiation,and whether interfering with the BMP4 signaling pathway might promote regeneration in the mammaliancochlea in vitro. People lose their hearing as they get older because the vibration-sensing cells in their inner ears die.Birds naturally regenerate their vibration-sensing cells, and we think this process is regulated by a moleculecalled BMP4. We want to test this idea by changing BMP4 activity in cultures of mouse inner ear organs."
435,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have developed an antibody fusion protein composed of avidin fused to a human IgG3 specific for the transferrin receptor (TfR). Our initial goal was to use this molecule (anti-TfR IgG3-Av) as a universal vector to deliver biotinylated agents into cancer cells. We have found that anti-TfR IgG3-Av effectively delivers biotinylated molecules into cancer cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and that these molecules remain active after their internalization. Furthermore, we have unexpectedly discovered that anti-TfR IgG3-Av, but not a recombinant anti-TfR IgG3 or a non-specific IgG3-Av, possesses a strong intrinsic antiproliferative/pro-apoptotic activity against hematopoietic malignant cell lines. Importantly, this cytotoxic activity may be further enhanced by the addition of biotinylated compounds. We now hypothesize that anti-TfR IgG3-Av can be used alone or in combination with other agents as a novel drug against an incurable plasma cell malignancy: multiple myeloma (MM). We propose to determine the effect of anti-TfR IgG3-Av on both proliferation and apoptosis of selected human MM cell lines and to define the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. We will also examine the additive/synergistic effect  of combining anti-TfR IgG3-Av with other cytotoxic/sensitizing agents, such as biotinylated Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) and drugs currently used in the treatment of MM such as Thalidomide and Dexamethasone. Based on our findings we will test the efficacy of anti-TfR IgG3-Av alone or combined with other anti-cancer drugs against primary myeloma cells obtained from MM patients and against human MM tumors growing in immunodeficient mice. Thus, the proposed experiments will result in a better understanding of the mechanism of action of anti-TfR IgG3-Av and will indicate if this novel therapeutic has potential for use in the treatment of MM. We anticipate that the utility of this therapeutic will not be restricted to the elimination of myeloma cells in vivo but can also be used for in vitro approaches including the efficient purging of myeloma cells during ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic progenitor-cells for use in autologous transplantation in MM patients. We would like to stress that the impact of the results obtained from the present studies is not restricted to MM. Similar approaches can be applied to other hematopoietic malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas."
442,HHS,HHS,"Project Summary: Polar Microtubule organizing centers (PMTOCs) such as the centrosome and spindlepole body have a well-established role in the nucleation of microtubule assembly in animal and fungal cells.Recent data have suggested, however, that PMTOCs have additional essential roles in the regulation ofmitosis and the cell cycle. Although this area is clearly important, most of the results obtained to date aredescriptive, and information as to the mechanisms by which PMTOCs participate in mitotic regulation islimited. y-Tubulin is a PMTOC protein that plays a critical role in microtubule nucleation. In the current grantperiod we have studied the effects of v-tubulin mutations in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans that inhibitgrowth at certain temperatures but do not block microtubule assembly. Our results reveal that these y-tubulin mutations disrupt the coordination of late mitotic events, chromosomal disjunction, movement ofchromosomes to the poles of the mitotic apparatus, and mitotic exit. Our data demonstrate, moreover, thatthese are not consequences of inadequate microtubule assembly or weak attachment of microtubules toPMTOCs. We believe that these mutations provide valuable tools that allow us to begin to study themechanisms by which y-tubulin and, by extension, PMTOCs participate in mitotic regulation. In the currentgrant period, we propose to determine which mitotic regulatory pathways are altered by these mutants andhow they are altered. We hypothesize that binding of mitotic regulatory proteins to PMTOCs is important fortheir functioning and that y-tubulin mutants may alter the binding of one or more of these proteins. We will,consequently, examine the localization patterns of mitotic regulatory proteins in mitosis. From these data,we expect to be able to determine the mechanisms by which y-tubulin functions in mitotic regulation.Relevance: Correct segregation of chromosomes is essential for cellular reproduction and development ofall multicellular organisms. Incorrect chromosomal segregation contributes to birth defects and theprogression of cells from normal to cancerous. Pathogenic species of Aspergillus are a major cause ofmortality in immune-compromised patients."
453,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Humans exhibit marked circadian rhythms in multiple cardiovascular (CV) parameters, including heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure. To date, circadian rhythms in physiological CV parameters have been attributed to the same neurohumoral stimuli (e.g. sympathetic activity) believed to be responsible for fatal CV events (e.g. myocardial infarctions, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death). Our studies expose a novel molecular mechanism within cardiomyocytes that directly regulates myocardial gene expression, metabolism, and function over the course of the day. This mechanism is the intramyocellular circadian clock. Circadian clocks are transcriptionally-based mechanisms that confer the selective advantage of anticipation, enabling the cardiomyocyte/heart to respond rapidly and appropriately to environmental stimuli upon their onset. The broad objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the circadian clock within the cardiomyocyte synchronizes responsiveness of the heart to the environment, and that impairment of this mechanism results in an inability of the heart to respond appropriately to its environment (i.e. maladaptation). Altered myocardial metabolism plays a central role in the pathogenesis of contractile dysfunction associated with hypertrophic, diabetic, and ischemic heart disease, conditions in which the circadian clock within the cardiomyocyte is impaired. We therefore intend to address the following specific aims: 1) identify the mechanisms by which the circadian clock within the cardiomyocyte modulates myocardial metabolism; and 2) determine the pathophysiological consequences of impairment of the circadian clock within the cardiomyocyte. For these studies, we will utilize our unique mouse model in which the circadian clock is specifically impaired within cardiomyocytes. For Specific Aim 1, we will utilize isolated working mouse hearts to identify the mechanisms by which the circadian clock within the cardiomyocyte channels fatty acids and glucose into oxidative versus non-oxidative pathways. For Specific Aim 2, we will investigate whether impairment of the circadian clock within the cardiomyocyte augments ischemia/reperfusion-, diabetes mellitus-, pressure overload-, aging-, and/or simulated shift work- mediated contractile dysfunction. Our long-term objectives are to establish causal links between impairment of the circadian clock within the cardiomyocyte with development of CV disease in humans."
458,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hundreds of different viruses are able to infect humans. The biology, life cycle and pathogenesis of different viruses are widely divergent. Nevertheless, based on current knowledge, it seems that the immune system employs mainly the same mechanism of antiviral protection to battle any type of virus. This mechanism relies on the action of type I interferons, IFNalpha/beta. These secreted proteins are released by virus-infected cells to warn neighboring cells about viral presence and to force the cells to deploy various means of antiviral protection. The robust production and secretion of type I IFNs in response to viral infection is currently considered to be a key event in the establishment of a multi-faceted antiviral response. However, recent discovery of a novel ligand-receptor system that, upon engagement, leads to the establishment of an antiviral state by a mechanism similar to, but independent from type I IFNs, opened a new direction in antiviral research. Three highly homologous proteins, distinct from type I IFNs, are capable of inducing antiviral protection. The proteins were designated IFN-lambdas (IFN-lambda1, IFN-lambda2 and IFN-lambda3), based on their antiviral activity. IFN-lambdas are also capable of up-regulating MHC class I antigen expression. Consistent with their role in antiviral response, the expression of IFN-lambda mRNA is inducible in several cell lines in response to various viruses. The IFN-lambda receptor complex have been identified and found to be distinct from the type I IFN receptor complex. Although IFN-lambda does not use the IFN-alpha/beta receptor complex for signaling, both IFN-lambda and IFN-alpha/beta induce overlapping biological activities and signaling events. Many questions related to the discovery of IFN-lambda antiviral system are still to be answered by future experiments, and are the focus of the current grant. The proposed project is designed to further investigate the biological activities of IFN-lambdas, to correlate their actions with those of type I IFNs, and to determine relationship between the IFN-lambda and type I IFN antiviral systems. Specific aims of the project are: to investigate expression of IFN-( genes in dendritic cells (DC) and activities of IFN-lambdas on DC and monocytes; to characterize differences in signal transduction events and protein expression profiles in response to IFN-lambda and IFN-alpha/beta using proteomics, and correlate them with biological activities; to study transcriptional regulation of IFN-lambda genes; and to create mice with disrupted IFN-lambdaR1 gene and study their phenotype."
463,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Gut injury and mucosal barrier failure play an important role in the development of septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome after surgical procedures, small bowel transplantation, and burns. Thus, our long term objective is to study mechanisms of preservation of mucosal barrier in surgical disorders. We and others found that TFF3 (trefoil factor 3) protects against acute mucosal injury. However, the mechanisms through which TFF3 induces mucosal protection are not clear. Recently, we found that TFF3 induces activation of intestinal NF-K:B in a transient event. Currently, relatively little is known about the physiological role of transient activated NF-KappaB in vivo although the prolonged activation of NF-KappaB plays an important role in the onset of inflammation. Several lines of evidence suggest that transient activation of NF-KappaB results in up-regulation of (a) cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic molecules, which protect against acute cellular injuries; and (b) inhibitory molecules of the NF-KappaB pathway, which subsequently attenuate amplification of the inflammatory network in tissues. Thus, we hypothesize that transient activation of NF-KappaB in intestinal epithelial cells by TFF3 prior to inflammatory strikes plays a central role in TFF3-induced mucosal protection. In preliminary studies, we have (a) determined the direct link between TFF3-triggered transient activation of NF-kappaB and TFF3-induced mucosal protection; and (b) found that pretreatment of intestinal epithelial cells with TFF3 reinforces the negative regulatory loop of NF-KappaB and limits inflammatory response to proinflammatory cytokine stimulations. In this proposal, we will address the following three logical questions: (a) Does TFF3-induced transient activation of NF-KappaB in intestinal epithelium play an essential role in the preventive effect of TFF3? (b) Is NF-KappaB required for TFF3 to regulate expression of gut-protective genes in intestinal epithelial cells and which mechanisms are involved in regulation of these gene expressions? (c) How does TFF3 induce transient activation of NF-KappaB in the intestinal epithelium? Achievement of the proposal will provide a novel concept that transient activation of NF-KB prior to the onset of inflammations in intestinal epithelium plays an important role in preservation of the mucosal barrier. We hope the study will shed the light for development of strategies to preserve mucosal barrier and prevent critical illnesses during surgical conditions."
491,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Initiation of cigarette smoking is prevalent among children of current nonsmokers and it significantly increases the odds of progression to habitual smoking by late adolescence. Prevention programs are needed that are appropriate for children, designed to be implemented at home by parents, and focused on anti-smoking socialization as a tool for preventing initiation of smoking. Aim I: Design and produce an intervention that enables parents who are current nonsmokers to engage in anti-smoking socialization with their 8 year old children. The intervention will apply communication, modeling, rule setting, monitoring, guided experience, and other socialization practices to modify children's perceptions of the prevalence of smoking, the acceptability of smoking, the accessibility of cigarettes, and the personal and social consequences of smoking. Aim II: Conduct a two-group, randomized controlled trial to test the intervention. Sample: A volunteer sample of 760 male and female children from single or two-parent households who will be 8 years old and in the pre-initiation stage of smoking at baseline will enroll with a nonsmoking mother, step-mother, or other female guardian. Design: The study will follow children from ages 8 through 11 (grades 3 through 6) to measure the effects of anti-smoking socialization on smoking-related outcomes. Eligible participants who complete the baseline survey will be randomly assigned to the treatment (core program plus two annual boosters) or alternative control condition. Data on core program utilization will be obtained via telephone interviews with parents 1 month post-treatment. Data on program effects will be obtained via telephone interviews with children 12, 24, and 36 months post-baseline. Primary hypothesis: Children of current non-smokers exposed to a program of anti-smoking socialization beginning at age 8 will be significantly less likely to initiate smoking than controls by age 11. Secondary hypothesis: Among children who remain abstinent to final follow-up, those exposed to the intervention will have significantly lower susceptibility to smoking than controls. Primary analysis: Survival analysis will test the effects of antismoking socialization on initiation of smoking. Secondary analysis: A proportional odds model will test the effects of anti-smoking socialization on susceptibility to smoking among children abstinent at final follow-up."
496,HHS,NSF,"Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF IL-1,IL-8, are produced by leukocytes in response tobacteria or their components. The inflammatory response involves leukocyte transcriptionalactivation and specific gene expression. Most studies have investigated the activation oftranscription factors, such as NF-kB, following exposure to a single inducer but/ in vivo, multiplepathogenic inducers exist simultaneously at sites of infection and inflammation; In the last fundingperiod, we have found that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a forpnylated peptide (fMLP),each induce activation of cytokine gene transcription in leukocytes. Interestingly, fMLP inducessome ihtracellular signaling events that differ from those induced by LPS. Both; stimuli, however,activate the signaling pathways that converge to IkB phosphorylation and NF-kB activation. Wehave further found that mixtures of fMLP and LPS behave synergistically, We!:j3elievje that thissynergy represents an important pathogenic mechanism during bacterial infection, but the mannerby which synergy is produced is poorly understood at the molecular level. This proposal, therefore,will investigate the intracellular signaling pathways that lead to the synergistic activation oftranscription factors controlling cytokine gene expression. Its main foci will beto characterize thesignaling molecules involved in the synergistic activation of leukocytes, and to analyze how asynergistic response is induced both in vitro and in mipe. Our overall hypothesis is that leukocytetranscriptional activation is regulated by bacterial products operating syhergisticallyrby using .multiple signaling pathways. Theyresults may lead to a fuller understanding of host defenses againstinfection and of thepathogenesis of inflammatory disorders."
523,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   We propose to continue a longitudinal study of 717 pairs of female twins from two  population-based cohorts with the aim of understanding the origins and consequences of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, we hypothesize that inherited vulnerability in two systems, disinhibition and negative affect, interacts with adolescent and early-adult experience and life circumstance to affect the likelihood of SUDs in adulthood. Through use of overlapping cohorts, we will chart the development of SUDs from pre-adolescence through early adulthood. The younger cohort, originally assessed at age 11, will be followed through age 24-25; the older cohort, originally assessed at age 17, will be followed through age 29-30. Participants complete a comprehensive in-person assessment that includes clinical interviews, psychophysiological indicators of risk, and self-reports of personality and environmental risk. DNA samples will also be obtained to enable future molecular genetic investigation. Analysis of data from early waves has allowed us to characterize a disinhibitory pathway that: 1) begins in pre-adolescence with early manifestations of problem behavior, 2) is predictive of SUD risk, 3) underlies the comorbidity of a wide range of disruptive disorders, 4) is substantially heritable, and 5) is indexed by psychophysiological markers of risk, like P3. Although the effects are not as marked, we have also shown that negative emotionality and internalizing disorders are associated with and prospectively predict the onset of SUDs in adulthood. Analysis of data from the proposed adult assessments will allow us to investigate the impact of these two pathways on the persistence and desistence of substance use and abuse at these life stages."
531,HHS,HHS,"The association between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and chronic infection with the human hepatitis Bvirus (HBV) has generated considerable interest in understanding how infection with HBV increases the riskfor liver cancer. Based on studies in woodchucks infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus, it is assumedthat the X protein (HBx) of all mammalian hepadnaviruses, including human HBV, is essential for viralreplication. There is also evidence that HBx contributes to the development of HCC. HBx activates manycellular signaling cascades; however, how this is accomplished is unclear. Most studies that sought toidentify the essential role of HBx during HBV replication, and understand how HBx regulates cellularsignaling pathways, were performed in liver cell lines derived from liver tumors. The use of immortalized ortransformed hepatocytes suffers from its lack of biological relevance compared to authentic hepatocytes. Wehave demonstrated that a key activity of HBx is regulation of cellular calcium signaling pathways. Thisproposal aims to understand key activities of HBx using cultures of primary rat hepatocytes and to determinehow these activities influence hepatocyte physiology and HBV replication. Studies in AIM 1 will characterizethe molecular mechanism of HBx activation of calcium signaling pathways in hepatocytes and how thisinfluences HBV replication. Studies in AIM 2 will focus on the interaction between HBx and mitochondriaand how this impacts hepatocyte physiology and HBV replication. AIM 3 specifically focuses on regulation ofapoptosis by HBx expressed alone or during HBV replication. Although the fundamental activities of HBx arelikely preserved in hepatocytes as compared to transformed cells, the magnitude, duration and complexity ofthese activities may differ in primary hepatocytes. Result from studies in primary rat hepatocytes shouldmore accurately reflect the state of an authentic infected cell, clarify the disparate HBx activites that havebeen reported, and provide a more sophisticated understanding of the role of HBx during HBV replication."
570,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the recent explosion in cross-cultural research in personality and social psychology, surprisingly little research has addressed basic questions regarding understanding and misunderstanding across cultures. Furthermore, while recent studies have revealed some factors that influence stability and change in self-concepts and personality, virtually none have examined the effect of cross-cultural interactions on stability and change in self-concepts and personality. The present project examines (a) the factors that contribute to subjective feelings of being understood or misunderstood by others with different cultural backgrounds and (b) the antecedents of cross-cultural interactions and the effects of such interactions on self-concepts and personality over time. A series of studies will be conducted to examine key processes involved in understanding and misunderstanding across cultures. Specifically, the author will conduct a 5-year longitudinal study, which includes an experience sampling method and a weekly diary method, as well as surveys over 5 years. This study will test important theoretical questions regarding the effect of personality on the quantity and quality of cross-cultural interactions; and it will test the effect of cross-cultural interactions on personality and self-concepts over time. In addition, a series of laboratory experiments will examine the processes involving expression of the self, accurate or inaccurate perceptions by the partner, affective reactions to the interaction and subjective feelings of being understood and misunderstood. Taken together, the present set of studies utilizing both naturalistic, longitudinal designs, and controlled laboratory experiments, will answer fundamental questions of interpersonal understanding, inter-cultural understanding, and stability and changes in self-concepts and personality."
592,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adipocytes are highly specialized cells that play a major role in energy homeostasis in vertebrate organisms. Obesity is the primary disease of fat cells and a major risk factor for the development of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Obesity and its related disorders result in dysregulation of the mechanisms that control the expression of metabolic genes in adipocytes. Significant advances towards an understanding of these regulatory processes have been made by the identification of transcription factors that regulate the differentiation of fat cells and are involved in the induction and maintenance of adipocyte gene expression. Our research has focused on the STAT family of transcription factors. STATs comprise a family of latent transcription factors that reside in the cytoplasm of resting cells. In response to a variety of stimuli, STATs become activated and translocate to the nucleus. Unlike other adipocyte transcription factors, STATs can be rapidly activated to regulate gene expression and represent a relatively unexplored paradigm in the transcriptional regulation of fat cells. We have shown that the expression of both STAT 5 proteins (STATs 5A, and 5B) strongly correlates with lipid accumulation and PPAR? expression during adipogenesis. It is known that STATs can have cell specific functions, and we hypothesize that these transcription factors play a key role in the regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and possibly in regulating genes that confer insulin sensitivity to the adipocyte. Our preliminary studies clearly demonstrate that STAT 5A can promote adipogenesis in non-precursor cells. In addition, we have shown that STAT 5A interacts with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the association of these two transcription factors is regulated during adipogenesis. Our preliminary studies have also identified some potential STAT 5 target genes in adipocytes. The studies outlined in the specific aims focus on understanding the function of STAT 5 proteins in adipocytes. We predict that these studies will lead to insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating energy homeostasis and may contribute to understanding the defects underlying obesity and NIDDM."
628,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When children engage in social aggression, they hurt peers by damaging their friendships and social status. Social aggression includes behaviors such as social exclusion (verbal and non-verbal), friendship manipulation, and malicious gossip. This Independent Scientist Award (K02) application seeks funding to support Marion K. Underwood, Ph.D., to investigate more fully the early developmental origins of social aggression and the psychosocial outcomes associated with engaging and being victimized by social aggression. Dr. Underwood is a child clinical psychologist with expertise in social aggression in the middle childhood and adolescent age ranges and experience in measuring social aggression using a variety of methods (creative observational techniques, sociometric nominations, and parent-, teacher-, and self-report questionnaires). She is the Principal Investigator of a longitudinal project currently in its third year, following a sample of 281 children from ages 9 -14 to investigate developmental origins and outcomes of social aggression. Short-term career development goals include augmenting quantitative skills to analyze these longitudinal data to maximum advantage, and increasing knowledge of preschool development and building a collaborative team to conduct a longitudinal study of social aggression beginning with 2-3-year-old children. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand better the role of social aggression in the development of psychopathology in girls and boys, to determine whether reducing social aggression might be helpful in preventing the development of externalizing disorders, internalizing problems, personality disorders, and eating disorders, and in promoting positive adjustment and achievement. Careful analyses of how social aggression unfolds, both developmentally and in real time, will guide the future development of prevention and intervention programs to reduce social aggression among girls and boys."
645,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This proposal describes a 5 year academic training program for a clinician-scientist.  The candidate has completed almost a decade in General Surgery followed by a specialty fellowship in Pediatric Surgery.  Due to a lengthy uninterrupted clinical track, the investigator proposes to complement prior training in immunology with current molecular techniques in gene therapy. This proposal will investigate the barriers to recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) gene therapy and focus on abrogating host immune responses that may critically limit the effectiveness of gene transfer.  Cystic fibrosis, CF, caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) leading to dysfunction of the chloride channel, is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population and the primary reason for pediatric lung transplantation.  Over the last decade significant progress has been made in the design of rAAV2 vectors as therapeutic vehicles to deliver a normal copy of the CFTR gene cDNA to the respiratory tract of CF patients with successful gene transfer and expression.  Multiple challenges remain to enhance vector efficiency, deliver sufficient titers in situ, and precondition or modulate the host's microenvironment.  Our recent work demonstrates that an endobronchial single administration of aerosolized rAAV2 vector can achieve high levels of gene transfer.  However repeated dosing is most likely required for lifetime correction of CFTR dysfunction.  An overall hypothesis is that the modulation of the local host immune response to a viral vector will lead to enhanced transgene expression and successful gene transfer upon repeated dosing.  This hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims, 1) to enhance gene transfer with an alternative serotype, AAV5, with an apical receptor ideal for aerosolized delivery.  Investigating alternative serotypes to augment gene transfer efficiency and expression provides a scientific basis to select a serotype ideal for a given mode of delivery and target organ and to alternate serotypes to minimize potential immunization upon vector reexposures.  Subsequent specific aims alter the host via immune modulation during the transient period of viral shedding, both 1) systemically and 2) locally in the pulmonary microenvironment to augment gene transfer.  Studies of the immunobiology of rAAV vector system are crucial in order to overcome the immunologic barriers to effective gene therapies and limitations of single dose gene transfer for critical advance for a vector system with broad applicability.  The laboratory of Dr. Guggino, the director of the Gene Therapy Center and an established investigator in the field, provides an ideal multidisciplinary environment with expertise in gene therapy and CFTR physiology, integrated in the setting of ongoing institutional CF clinical trials.  The Department of Surgery provides the academic framework for clinician scientists to focus on establishing an investigatory career with novel therapeutics that potentiate the frontiers of pediatric surgery such as in utero intervention and/or surgery for congenital defects and in born errors of metabolism."
652,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The goal of this application is to design functional biomaterials to carry antisense plasmids and antisense oligonucleotides to islet beta cell based on results from successful preliminary studies. The designed nontoxic and cationic polymeric carriers are conjugated with a targeting moiety of sulfonylurea (SU) or antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (antiGAD) antibody. These functional and biospecific biomaterials will carry the antisense GAD plasmid to islet beta cells, where they will suppress GAD antigen production and prevent autoimmune induced type I diabetes, which is triggered by GAD antigen. We will construct antisense GAD plasmids containing cDNAs of GAD-65 and GAD-67 with rat insulin promoters for site specific expression of antisense in RNAs. AntiGAD or SU conjugated polyethene glycol (PEG)/polyethylene imine (PEI) copolymer will be synthesized that will form stable complexes with the plasmids. These polymer complexes will target islet beta cells through antigen GAD or SU receptors present in the islet cells, which are expected to enhance transfection and expression. A second approach will also be investigated which includes direct chemical binding of synthesized antisense oligonucleotide (ODN) to SU grafted PEG or antiGAD grafted PEG using an acid labile linkage. A cationic fusogenic oligopeptide, WEAK-LAKA-LAKA-LAKH-LAKA-LKAC-EA (KALA) will be incorporated to form a stable micelle complex with the designed ODN conjugated polymer. This complex traffics to the cell via endocytosis and releases ODN in the acidic endosome by breakdown of the acid labile bond. The use of KALA significantly enhances trancription. After extensive characterization and analysis of in vitro cellular uptake, bioactivity and transfection with the above designed systems, systematic in vivo evaluation will be carried out in NOD mice. Biodistribution, efficacy, duration and optimal dosed delivery will be determined. The obtained results are anticipated to support the proposed application to treat early stage type I diabetes, which currently has no method for treatment."
662,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Recent breakthroughs in molecular biotechnology are allowing simultaneous measurements of thousands of gene products in a single experiment. Understanding the complexity of such datasets requires a thorough training in both traditional molecular biology and computational sciences. The primary goal of this mentored development award is to provide the Principal Investigator (PI) the training and environmental support necessary to develop into an independent computational molecular biologist in the field of cardiopulmonary biology. This multidisciplinary award will support the PI's training in the disciplines of physiology, molecular biology, computational biology and statistics, and allow him to combine these tools to investigate the molecular basis of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular remodeling. The primary scientific goal of this project is to discover several key genetic pathways in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) by applying rigorous statistical methods to data generated from global gene expression profiling. Two concurrent but interdependent Specific Aims will be pursued. Aim 1 will identify, characterize and confirm a set of temporally and functionally related genes that are crucial in the development and regression of pulmonary hypertension and RVH in mice. Different mouse models of pulmonary hypertension and RVH will be compared to search for common genetic pathways during both the progression and regression of these processes. Additionally, the hypothesis that pulmonary vascular and right ventricular remodeling share several common molecular pathways will be tested. This approach will uniquely provide global insights into the complex molecular processes activated during vascular and ventricular remodeling. Aim 2 will allow the PI to develop and improve computational methods to normalize raw data, determine statistically significant gene expression, and apply clustering strategies to microarray-generated datasets. The results of investigations undertaken in Aim 2 will be applied directly to data generated in Aim 1. Pursuit of a Master's of Science in Computational Biology will further enhance the PI's ability to successfully merge complex mathematical models with datasets resulting from large-scale gene expression profiling. Ultimately, this mentored research career award will allow the PI to develop into an independent computational molecular biologist and pursue an academic research career in the physiologic genomics of the cardiopulmonary system."
689,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Transcription initiation by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) involves a series of steps: (i) RNAP binds to promoter DNA, yielding an RNAP-promoter closed complex; (ii) RNAP clamps tightly onto promoter DNA, yielding an RNAP-promoter intermediate complex; (in) RNAP unwinds -14 base pairs of promoter DNA, yielding a catalytically competent RNAP-promoter open complex; (iv) RNAP initiates synthesis of RNA, yielding an RNAP-promoter initial transcribing complex; and (v) RNAP breaks its interactions with promoter DNA- escapes -yielding an RNAP-DNA elongation complex. Each of these steps is a potential target for transcriptional regulators. Understanding transcription initiation and transcriptional regulation will require defining the structural transitions in protein and DNA at each step, defining kinetics of structural transitions, and defining mechanisms by which transcriptional regulators affect structural transitions.     The proposed work will use kinetic photocrosslinking, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, single-molecule nanomanipulation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to address four specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: To analyze formation of protein-DNA interactions during promoter entry.  Specific Aim 2: To analyze breakage of protein-DNA interactions during promoter escape.  Specific Aim 3: To analyze DNA structural transitions during promoter entry and escape.  Specific Aim 4: To analyze RNAP structural transitions during promoter entry and escape.    In addition, the proposed work will use integrated crystallographic, biophysical, biochemical, genetic, and combinatorial-chemistry approaches to address two specific aims:    Specific Aim 5: To characterize known small-molecule inhibitors of RNAP.  Specific Aim 6: To identify and characterize novel small-molecule inhibitors of RNAP.    The results will contribute to understanding bacterial transcription initiation and regulation, will provide tools for analysis of bacterial transcription initiation and regulation, and will provide lead compounds for development of antibacterial therapeutic agents. Since eukaryotic RNAP shows sequence, structural, and functional similarities to bacterial RNAP, the results also will contribute to understanding eukaryotic transcription initiation and regulation."
711,HHS,HHS,"Project Summary. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to define the molecular mechanism bywhich the Staphylococcus aureus protein, staphylocoagulase (SC), activates blood coagulation, and its rolein the pathology of acute bacterial endocarditis. Thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural approaches areproposed to address major gaps in the understanding of the unique mechanism by which SC activatesprothrombin (ProT) non-proteolytically and forms an SOProT complex that specifically converts fibrinogen (Fbg) into fibrin. The studies focus on 6 areas: (1) Structure-function relationships governing the critical SCN-terminal insertion that induces conformational ProT activation will be investigated to characterize thespecificity of the N-terminal binding cleft, and to evaluate the hypothesis that insertion is a reversibleequilibrium process that can induce different levels of activation. (2) The pathway of individual binding and conformational change events in the molecular mechanism of conformational activation of ProT by SC will bedefined in fluorescence- and activity-monitored rapid-reaction kinetic studies. (3) The structure-functionrelationships between the two modes of Fbg interactions, as a substrate of the active SC¿ProT complexbound via N-terminal SC domains, and as a Fbg adhesion protein through C-terminal SC repeat sequenceswill be investigated in binding, kinetic, and crystallographic studies. (4) Mutagenesis-based structure-functionstudies will test the hypothesis that autolysis loop residues of human and bovine ProT control the speciesspecificity of SC-ProT activation. (5) The mechanisms through which proteins of the newly discoveredzymogen activator and adhesion p/otein (ZAAP) family of SC homologs activate zymogens, cleave proteinsubstrates, and bind to plasma and extracellular matrix proteins will be investigated. (6) The mechanism ofinhibition of SC-ProT activation by antibodies specific for the N-terminal sequence will be investigated as apotential therapeutic approach for treating endocarditis. The studies proposed will provide a detailedunderstanding of the molecular mechanisms of SC-activated blood coagulation. This may enable the designof new mechanism-based therapeutic agents for treating endocarditis. Extension of the studies to otherZAAP family members will provide new insight into the roles of these novel proteins that target the human blood coagulation system in the pathogenesis of life-threatening staphylococcal and streptococcal diseases. Relevance. Minor injury to the surface of a heart valve in combination with bacteria in the blood stream can cause acute bacterial endocarditis, an infection that is alarmingly, 25-40% fatal despite antibiotictherapy. The common bacterium, S. aureus, secretes staphylocoagulase, a protein that activates human blood clotting and thereby propagates growths on heart valves that contain bacteria enmeshed by blood clots.Biochemical research is proposed to define the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenic activity ofstaphylocoagulase, and ultimately to design new drugs to inhibit its role in endocarditis."
755,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The mechanisms by which a diverse group of pharmacological agents produce anesthesia remain uncertain. A potentially important region within the central nervous system (CNS) for contributing to the anesthetized state is the thalamus; it is a critical relay site for sensory information, and two specific nuclei, the ventrobasal nucleus and the reticular nucleus, are considered to be essential structures in the generation of consciousness and sleep. Since anesthetics depress consciousness and induce  sleep,  it is important to understand how anesthetics alter synaptic transmission and cell physiology in these two regions. Inhibitory synaptic transmission helps regulate thalamic function, and the GABA-A receptor is the primary receptor for mediating fast inhibitory synaptic transmission within the CNS. The focus of this proposal is to explore how two different anesthetic agents, the volatile anesthetic - isoflurane, and the intravenous anesthetic - propofol, modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission and neuronal activity in the ventrobasal nucleus and reticular nucleus. Aim 1 - What are the effects of propofol on synaptic transmission and membrane excitability in the thalamus? The hypothesis to be tested is that propofol will potentiate synaptic inhibition and depress neuronal activity to a greater extent in VB neurons than in RTN neurons. Aim 2 - What are the effects of isoflurane on synaptic transmission and membrane excitability in the thalamus? The hypothesis to be tested is that isoflurane will potentiate synaptic inhibition and depress neuronal activity to a greater extent in VB neurons than in RTN neurons. Aim 3 - How do propofol and isoflurane affect the ability of the RTN to regulate action potential firing in the VB? The hypothesis to be tested is that both agents will facilitate RTN-induced inhibition of action potential firing in VB neurons. By better understanding how anesthetic agents interact with specific subunits of the GABA-A receptor in different regions of the brain, it may be possible to design more selective, and therefore safer, anesthetics."
793,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  HIV vaccines are currently being developed that elicit virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses (Letvin, 2002). Studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated that such vaccines may not be able to confer sterile protection against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or simian human  immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection, but can confer protection against high levels of viral replication and  progression of clinical disease. However, we have recently shown that mutations can accrue in virus in vaccinated and then infected monkeys that allows the virus to escape from recognition by dominant epitope specific CTL (Barouch, et al. 2002, 2003). The emergence of viruses with such mutations is associated with the onset of high levels of viral replication and subsequent death of the monkeys with an AIDS-like illness. If CTL-based HIV vaccines are ultimately to be useful, we must devise strategies that avoid these events.  Such strategies can only be developed if we have a better understanding of the structural constraints to compensate for the loss of effective dominant epitope-specific CTL. The studies described in this grant application elucidate the viral and immune events associated with this virus escape phenomenon in SHIV and SIV/rhesus monkey models of AIDS. Specifically, these studies include a definition of the 1. Biochemistry and structure of CTL escape viruses.  2. Biologic properties of CTL escape viruses. A. In vitro replicative capacity.  B. In vivo replicative capacity.  C. Fitness relative to wild type viruses.  3. Nondominant SHIV epitope-specific CTL populations.  A. Breadth and magnitude.  B. Functional repertoire.  C. TCR repertoire.  4. Nondominant epitope-specific CTL and control of SIV replication."
799,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The majority of cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis. Given the important clinical problem, research in this area is necessary in order to improve cure rates. Dissemination of research findings is also critical since the problem is both complex and important.  This R13 application is to support the 10th, 11th and 12th International Congresses of the Metastasis Research Society.  The 10th Biennial Meeting of the Society, which has taken place alternately in Europe and United States since 1984, will take place in Genoa, Italy.  Future meetings are planned for 2006 in Tokushima, Japan and 2008 in the United States.  These meetings are important and timely with regard to recent advances in the metastasis field.    Congresses of the Metastasis Research Society have become widely recognized for their overall excellence in defining basic research approaches for the treatment, prevention and control of metastasis.  They are unique in that few meetings focus on this clinical problem.  The 10th International Congress will address today's most challenging and unresolved problems in the field.  The objective is to exchange new data, technology and ideas in both formal and informal settings.  The conference is designed with overview lectures by senior investigators in genetics, microenvironment influence on tumor cells, new treatments, immunology/chemoprevention and imaging/molecular diagnostics and signaling. The plenary talks will be followed in each session by an additional 3-4 presentations selected from proffered abstracts.  Inclusion of a high percentage of papers from the abstracts is a tradition of the Metastasis Research Society and serves the purpose of fostering young investigator development and recognition.    Conference goals are: (1) To define the challenges and opportunities in metastasis; (2) To encourage young and established investigators to focus research endeavors in metastasis by defining high priority, unresolved basic and clinical issues and by discussing approaches of investigation for each; (3) To encourage multidisciplinary analysis of current data relevant to the biology, prevention in management of cancer metastasis; (5) To identify research opportunities, approaches and resources needed to develop new preventive, diagnostic and treatment approaches for metastatic disease; (6) To promote research and to encourage collaboration which will focus diversified expertise and resources on priority topics relevant to metastatic disease; and (7) To disseminate results presented at the conference."
828,HHS,HHS,"The transcription factor, Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-KB) plays a pivotal role in inflammation and localactivation of NF-KB in the airway epithelium plays a crucial role in the causation of airway inflammation. NF-KB is redox sensitive, and changes in the oxidative environment are critical in controlling its activation.During the current funding period we demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), represses the activationof NF-KB through reversible oxidation of a specific cysteine residue within Inhibitory kappa B kinase-beta(IKKP), the prerequisite kinase driving NF-KB activation. S-glutathionylation of Cysteine 179 within IKKp isthe critical oxidation responsible for IKK inactivation by H2O2. S-glutathionylation has emerged as a newlyrecognized reversible oxidation relevant to signal transduction, since glutaredoxin (GRX) enzymes serve tospecifically reduce S-glutathionylated cysteines, regenerating the reduced sulfhydryl group. We havedemonstrated using overexpression or SiRNA approaches that glutaredoxin-1 (GRX1) is critical incontrolling the magnitude of NF-KB activation. Since redox changes accompany the pathophysiology ofallergic airways disease, and GRX1 is upregulated in airway epithelium of mice with allergic airwaysdisease, GRX1 has the potential to contribute to the chronic NF-KB activation seen in mice with allergicinflammation. The hypothesis of the current proposal is that S-glutathionylation perturbs the IKKPsignalsome to repress activation of NF-KB. Glutaredoxin-1 (GRX1), by reversing S-glutathionylatedcysteines overcomes this oxidative inhibition, and promotes NF-KB activation in the lung, leading toaggravated inflammation. Specific Aim #1 will elucidate biochemical basis for IKKp inhibition by S-glutathionylation through examining IKK signalsome organization, and interactions with GRX1. We also willexplore the interplay between S-glutathionylation of Cysteine 179, and phosphorylation of flanking Serines177 and 181 of IKKp. Specific Aim #2 will determine whether changes in steady state levels of S-glutathionylation following modulation of Glutaredoxin-1 (GRX1) affect NF-KB activation and inflammatorygene expression in primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. SpecificAim #3 will determine whether mice lacking Glutaredoxin-1 (GRX1-/-) display enhanced protein-S-glutathionylation, lowered activation of NF-KB, and inflammation compared to wildtype mice, in response tosensitization and challenge with Ovalbumin (Ova). Specific Aim #4 will determine whether conditionaloverexpression of glutaredoxin-1 (GRX1) in mice lowers protein S-glutathionylation, and enhancesactivation of NF-KB, and subsequent inflammation induced by Ova. These approaches will provide criticalinsights into the physiological relevance of GRX1-controlled redox regulation of NF-KB in airways."
855,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopaminergic neurotransmission at the D1 family of dopamine receptors (D1 R) is critical for normal cognitive functioning, and impairments in this system are linked with schizophrenic symptomology and cocaine abuse. However, the exact mechanism by which D1R signaling affects these functions is not clear. Studies on individual neurons show that there are specific and complex circuit effects of D1R drugs in the PFC, suggesting a structural component for the actions of dopamine at the D1 and D5 receptors. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to utilize immunohistochemical electron microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation to examine how dopamine acting at D1 and D5 receptors can modulate activity in the PFC. The first aim will determine the localization of D1 and D5 receptors within specific components of PFC circuitry. Because the effects of D1R activation rely on a complex signal transduction pathway, the second aim will determine if key proteins in this pathway are available to each D1R in specific components of PFC circuitry. The third aim will extend the neuroanatomical findings by identifying D1R downstream targets such as NMDA, AMPA and GABA receptors that specifically interact with D1 and D5 and two critical D1R signal transduction proteins."
883,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cockroach (CR) exposure is a predisposing factor for the development of asthma.  While many aeroallergens contain protease activity, the role of proteases in modulating the inflammatory response is unknown. We have shown that cockroach extract contains proteolytic activity which is responsible for synergistically increasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-mediated interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 expression.  In addition, we have preliminary data suggesting that cockroach proteases activate the protease activated receptor (PAR)-2 on airway epithelium to elicits signaling cascade to extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) activation.  To understand the mechanism by which active cockroach proteases modulate airway inflammation in vitro and in vivo, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Establish the role of CR serine protease activity on PARs and its effects on the pro-inflammatory response. We will examine whether TNF alpha stimulation regulates PAR-2 expression by RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.  We will activate PAR-2 with the activating peptide SLIGKV and investigate its role in cytokine expression. We will overexpress PAR-2 in Cos-1 cells and determine its role in inflammation.  We will purify the serine protease from the crude CR extract. 2. Establish the downstream signaling events mediating CR-induced regulation of IL-8. We have evidence that ERK is activated following CR treatment.  We will examine the role of transcription factors NF-IL6 and AP-1 on CR-induced synergy.  This will be done by promoter deletion studies, DMA binding and transactivation studies. We will determine if NF-IL6 or AP-1 is required or sufficient for the regulation of IL-8. We will determine if crosstalk occurs between ERK and NF-kappa B pathways. Finally we will determine if CR extract transcriptionally regulates other cytokines/chemokines.  3. Establish an in vivo role for cockroach serine protease activity in modulating airway inflammation and reactivity. We will determine the role of proteases in modulating airway inflammation by ex vivo inhibition of the protease activity prior to treatment.  We will establish a role for PAR-2 in modulating airway responses using PAR-2 knockout mice.  Finally, we will investigate the role of endogenous TNF alpha in the airways using a TNF alpha neutralizing antibody and TNF alpha knockout mice."
917,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is the agent of Legionnaires' disease pneumonia. In its aquatic habitat, Lp survives as an intracellular parasite of protozoans, and after inoculation into the lung, it flourishes within alveolar macrophages. Previously, we discovered an Lp gene (pilD) whose product is homologous with PilD, which, in other Gram-negatives, mediates pilus biogenesis and type II protein secretion. Indeed, an Lp pilD mutant lacked pili. More importantly, the pilD mutant, but not a pilin mutant, was defective for infection of amoebae and macrophages, suggesting that Lp has a type II secretion system that promotes infection. During this last grant period, we confirmed Lp has a type II system (lsp) that mediates secretion of many proteins, including novel enzymes, and is critical for infection of both protozoa and human cells. Some of our other data suggested that the Lp peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Mip and SurA have a role in the secretion process. Presently, Lp is the only known system for studying type II secretion in an intracellular pathogen. In the last grant period, we also demonstrated that lsp mutants are greatly impaired for survival in the lungs of A/J mice, with the severity of their defect indicating that Lp type II secretion is a key virulence determinant that may be involved in more than just macrophage infection. Finally, we made the novel observation that lsp is required for growth at 12-25 degrees C. Thus, Lp type II secretion is uniquely critical for intracellular infection, virulence, and low-temperature growth. In the current proposal, we aim to identify the type II exoproteins that are critical for intracellular infection, confirm the role of Mip and SurA in secretion, and determine how type II secretion promotes in vivo survival as well as low-temperature growth in water and amoebae. The results of these studies will i) increase our understanding of Lp physiology and pathogenesis, ii) provide new insight into bacterial protein secretion, intracellular infection, and low-temperature growth, and iii) have implications for other important human pathogens, including both other intracellular parasites and extracellular pathogens, such as Vibrio, Pseudomonas, and Burkholderia that survive at low-temperature and have type II systems."
950,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our research program is to understand how the vertebrate gustatory system transduces signals and encodes information. Of particular importance are the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their coupled G proteins. During the past decade we have identified and characterized several taste transduction elements, including taste receptors (Tlr3), G proteins ((-gustducin, (-transducin, G(13) and ion channels (Trpm5). The scope of this Competing Continuation encompasses the roles in taste transduction and coding of Tlr taste receptors, the G proteins co-expressed with and coupled to these receptors, and the transient receptor potential (Trp) channels expressed in Tlr-positive taste cells. We will use a multidisciplinary approach applying molecular biological, transgenic, behavioral and electrophysiological techniques to achieve the following Specific Aims. 1. To determine if taste cells express Tlr4. 2. To determine which Tlr receptors are co-expressed with Tlr4. 3. To determine which G protein subunits are co-expressed with Tlr receptors. 4. To determine which Trp channels are co-expressed with Tlr receptors. 5. To heterologously express Tlr receptors. 6. To use Caimaging to monitor responses of cells expressing the Tlr receptors. 7. To generate single, double and triple knockout mice lacking Tlr receptors. 8. To behaviorally characterize the Tlr knockout mice. 9. To electrophysiologically characterize the Tlr knockout mice. 10. To generate knockout mice lacking Trpm5. 11. To generate transgenic mice expressing Trpm5 in Tlr2- and Tlr3-positive taste cells. 12. To behaviorally characterize the Trpm5 transgenic mice. 13. To electrophysiologically characterize the Trpm5 transgenic mice. The results of these studies will provide significant new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying taste transduction and coding. The Tlr receptors are involved in the detection of sugars and sweeteners. A molecular knowledge of their mode of function may lead to the development of novel effective non-caloric sweeteners that may be useful in weight control programs to limit obesity and obesity-related diseases. Gustatory and metabolic disorders such as malgeusia, dysgeusia and cachexia frequently occur in conjunction with several types of cancer. The knowledge gained from this proposal should further our understanding of the molecular bases of taste disorders and may lead to effective intervention."
980,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This competitive renewal application for a K24 award is to provide support as I (Paul R. Conlin) further my work in patient-oriented research and mentoring of junior investigators. My career has focused on studying mechanisms of blood pressure regulation and more recently, methodologies to improve diabetes care. My long-term goals remain focused on studying lifestyle modification strategies to reduce renal and cardiovascular disease risk factors in patients with hypertension and diabetes through clinical trials. Prior to and during the current award period, I was a co-investigator in three interventional nutrition studies that explored the effects of macro- and micronutrients on blood pressure. As a direct extension of these studies, I am now investigating the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on renal and cardiovascular hemodynamics, to better understand the mechanisms by which the diet lowers blood pressure. In these studies, I am testing the hypothesis that the DASH diet has ACE inhibitor-like effects on renal blood flow, renal and vascular responsiveness to angiotensin II, vascular stiffness, and diastolic function. These studies are being conducted in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. I have also extended my clinical research program to include funded studies at our affiliated VA Medical Center, where I study care management strategies using information technology, to improve blood pressure and glucose control in patients with diabetes mellitus. As a direct result of the protected time afforded by this K24 award, I am mentoring 3 junior investigators (two of whom have career development awards), have accepted a new research fellow to join me in early 2007, and I co-mentor two other individuals. I have assumed a leadership role in the K30-funded  Scholars in Clinical Sciences Program  at Harvard Medical School, serving as Chair of the Mentoring Committee. During the new award period, I will continue with my funded research program and expand the scope of my mentoring, both directly and indirectly through the K30 program. I have a great passion for mentoring junior investigators destined for careers in patient-oriented research, particularly those interested in renal and cardiovascular physiology, interventional nutrition or diabetes care management. With the support of this award, I will make a significant impact on future patient-oriented researchers at multiple levels."

The series of cellularevents leading to insulin secretion is very complex, reflecting its importance in glucose homeostasis. Proteinsmay be involved in the dynamic translocation of channels and other signaling molecules in glucose stimulatedinsulin secretion, such as ERM proteins. ERM proteins (Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin) are a family of proteinsthat functionally link the actin cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane. This family of proteins becomesactivated through phosphorylation by Akt2 at a critical threonine on the C- terminus, relieving ERMautoinhibition and allowing them to act as scaffolding molecules. ERM proteins have been implicated in thetranslocation of channels to the plasma membrane upon stimulation in other cell types. Insulin secretion occursthrough the interaction of numerous channels and these channels may translocate as well. ERM proteins havenot been investigated in insulin secreting cells, but may be quite important in their physiology. We haverecently deomonstrated their presence and activation in pancreatic beta cells. This research will address therole of ERM proteins in insulin secretion and beta cell physiology."
997,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding the genetic basis of drug resistance is essential for using genotypic drug resistance testing to help physicians select optimal therapy for their patients, for designing new antiviral drugs, and for monitoring the spread of drug-resistant viruses. We plan to identify patterns of protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), and perhaps envelope, and integrase mutations developing in HIV-1 isolates from persons receiving antiretroviral therapy. We will use these patterns to create panels of prototypical infectious biological and molecular clones with high-level resistance to each drug class to assist scientists investigating the biophysical and biochemical basis of drug resistance. To determine whether drug resistance can be explained solely by mutations in the molecular targets of drug therapy, we will compare the susceptibility of biological clones obtained directly from a patient sample with those of recombinant molecular clones in which only the target of therapy has been contributed by the biological clone. We will also compare the susceptibility of recombinant and non-recombinant biological clones from subtype A, C, D, F, G, A/E, and A/G isolates with common patterns of drug-resistance mutations. To examine the role of newly identified treatment-associated RT and protease mutations, we will compare the susceptibility and replication of pairs of clones that are isogenic except for mutation at the position of interest. We hypothesize that HIV-1 isolates with high-level class resistance consist of complex mixtures of clones with related but distinct patterns of drug-resistance mutations. The extent of drug resistance in such isolates is likely to be lower than the cumulative amount of drug resistance in the clones that comprise the isolate. Drugs that are only partially active against isolates with high-level class resistance may not be effective for salvage therapy because these isolates may harbor subpopulations that will require only one or two additional mutations to become highly cross-resistant to a new drug. We will examine the susceptibility of clones from high-level class-resistant isolates to drugs in pre-clinical and clinical development and will culture these clones in the presence of increasing concentrations of these drugs to select viruses with high level cross-resistance for use in drug development efforts."
1018,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimmune communication has been implicated in both physiological defense against infection and pathogenic events contributing to many disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). A key mediator for this communication is interleukin-1. The following evidences indicate IL-1 acts on cells of the blood brain barrier to affect the CNS: 1) The functional 1L-1 receptor (type I IL-1 receptor, IL-1r1) is mostly expressed on CNS endothelial cells, 2) IL-1-responsive immediate early gene IkappaBalpha is induced primarily in CNS endothelium after central IL-1 injection; 3) inflammatory mediators such as the prostaglandins are induced in brain endothelial cells after both peripheral and central immune challenges; and 4) IL-1r1 is essential for mediating the recruitment of leukocytes across the BBB during the development of CNS immune responses. The central hypothesis of this proposal, therefore, is that IL-1 affects the CNS through the activation of CNS endothelial cells. This hypothesis can be tested directly in our recently created transgenic mice with which we can specifically inhibit the expression of IL-1r1 on endothelial cells. The long range goal of this application is to elucidate the role of BBB in mediating neuroimmune crosstalk. Using these transgenic animals, the following specific aims will be tested: 1) Determine the distribution of IL-1r1 protein expression in the CNS in normal and immunologically challenged mice. 2) Determine the role of endothelial IL-1r1 in mediating the activation of the neural circuits and the functional consequences induced by peripheral and central immune challenges. 3) Determine the role of endothelial IL-1r1 in the recruitment of leukocyte across the BBB. 4) Determine the role of endothelial IL-1r1 in mediating the development and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The results of this project should provide a definitive analysis to determine the role of endothelial IL-1r1 in several aspects of neuroimmune interaction."
1100,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): COUP-TFII is an orphan nuclear receptor that belongs to the steroid receptor superfamily. Ablation of COUP-TFII in mice results in early embryonic lethality due to defects in angiogenesis and heart development. To further understand the biological functions of COUP-TFII in vascular and heart development, LacZ knock-in and floxed COUP-TFII mice were generated. X-Gal staining of the LacZ knock-in mice shows high COUP-TFII expression in the endothelium of the vein but not in the artery. Further, chimera analysis showed that COUP-TFII plays a cell autonomous function in the endothelial cells of the vein but not the artery. These studies show for the first time that COUP-TFII is an essential transcription factor for vein identify. The insertion of loxP site into the COUP-TFII locus reduced the expression of COUP-TFII, rendering the COUP-TFII flox/- mutants genetically hypomorphic. The hypomorphic mutants exhibit atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) commonly observed in congenital heart disease patients. The atrium malformation displayed by the COUP-TFII null mutant coupled with AVSD elicited by the hypomorphic mutant together suggest that COUP-TFII plays a critical role in cardiogenesis. Whether the heart defects are intrinsic or secondary to the vascular defects is currently unknown. Proper heart development requires the coordinated interactions between the endocardium and myocardium. Whether the endothelial cells in the endocardium or the myocardial cells in the myocardium are the targets of COUP-TFII regulation is also unclear. To elucidate the role of COUP-TFII in the maintenance of vein identity and in heart development, two Specific Aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will employ gain-of-function and loss-of-function of COUP-TFII in the endothelial cells to examine the role of COUP-TFII in the maintenance of arteriovenous identity. In addition, we will use DMA chip microarray analysis to identify novel downstream targets and signaling pathways that are regulated by COUP-TFII in the arteriovenous decision. In Aim 2, we will use the hypomorphic mutant and the endothelial and myocardial conditional COUP-TFII knockouts to investigate the role of COUP-TFII in heart development. This study will enable us to determine how endothelial COUP-TFII versus myocardial COUP-TFII affects cardiogenesis and how COUP-TFII modulates the interaction between the myocardium and endocardium. Our proposed studies should provide timely new insights into how COUP-TFII impacts cardiovascular development and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease."
1130,HHS,NSF,"The conventional framework for understanding reactivity and selectivity in organic reactions fails forreactions influenced by dynamic effects. Our work has identified three types of dynamic effects that weexpect to be common in ordinary organic reactions in solution. We propose their detailed mechanisticinvestigation in diverse reactions. The aim of this research is to identify experimental examples and developexperimentally-based evidence for each type of dynamic effect. This includes the characterization ofobservations associated with dynamic effects and the development of new experimental tests for dynamiceffects. We also aim to establish examples of these types of dynamic effects in enzymatic and organometallicreactions. Overall, our goal is to provide a sufficient experimental phenomenology to foster understanding,allowing other workers to recognize when dynamic effects play a role in their reactions.

The UPCC proposal includes translational immunotherapeutics, targeted antiangiogenesis, and molecular neuropathology projects directly relevant to the mission of the consortium. UPCC is currently conducting two cytokine gene-transfer based autologous glioma cell vaccine trials for newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant gliomas and an active program to develop peptide antigen-based dendritic cell glioma vaccines. The UPCC institutional and NABTC multi-institutional effort will be intimately linked with the ongoing interests, needs, and support of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and the Radiation Research Program (RRP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment. The overall goal of this program is to more effectively treat patients with primary brain tumors, especially malignant glioma, with the purpose of increasing the duration and quality of survival."
1160,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): InnoSense LLC (ISL) submits this revised application with the intent of developing a cost-effective and highly sensitive polymer nanowire-based electronic biosensor (PNEBD) for the early screening of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This device is expected to have potentially significant implications in the early treatment and possible delay of debilitating symptoms associated with this disease. The Phase I project is focused on the development and verification of a high-throughput device based on silicon photolithography processes and template-free electrodeposition of functionalized conductive polymers between narrow-gap electrode junctions. Six tasks have been proposed to establish the Phase I feasibility of detecting amyloid-¿ derived diffusible ligand (ADDL) antigen, a biomarker for AD, using amyloid-¿ (A¿) oligomer specific antibody to ADDLs. Current evidence strongly suggests a central role for amyloid-¿ (A¿) in the pathogenesis of AD. At the present time there is no definite clinical diagnosis for AD other than autopsy. It has been demonstrated that ADDLs are present at significantly elevated levels in the autopsied brain samples of humans with AD. This association of ADDLs with AD suggests that the PNEBD device could provide a definitive molecular basis for the laboratory diagnosis of AD. For ensuring success, a highly skilled research team, including an expert on AD, has been assembled to execute the project. Development of ultrasensitive detection methods for early screening of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important issue in clinical disease diagnosis and mechanistic understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease for which there is neither a cure nor an early diagnostic device. It is the leading cause of dementia in people over age 65 affecting over four million Americans. Despite its utmost importance, no ultrasensitive technologies have been developed for clinical lab diagnostic of AD. InnoSense LLC aims to fill this void by developing a cost-effective and highly-sensitive polymer nanowire-based electronic biosensor device (PNEBD). This device will utilize electrochemically grown polymer nanowires at micro- to nanoscale patterned electrode junctions for detecting amyloid-¿ derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs). ADDL has been established as a biomarker for AD. The purpose of using an electrochemical method is to grow template-free, low-cost and high quality polymer nanowires on to the electrode junctions. This direct, one-step fabrication technique is scalable. This project will advance our knowledge on the detection of Alzheimer's disease."
1175,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to define angiogenic responses to Wnt secreted growth factors (Wnts) and to probe their roles in vascular development and physiology. Wnts act through the frizzled receptors to activate several distinct signaling cascades including the Wnt/beta-catenin, Wnt/Ca2+ , and Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathways, the latter two referred to as  non-canonical  pathways. The overall objective is to determine the relative roles of the Wnt/beta-catenin and Wnt/Ca2+ pathways in endothelial and mural cells. Our hypothesis is that Wnt/Frizzled signaling is critical for proper vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and vascular function. Our general strategy will be to define cellular and physiological consequences of selectively altering Wnt/beta-catenin and Wnt/Ca2+. signaling in vascular cells using in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our preliminary studies suggest that both the canonical and non-canonical pathways can stimulate endothelial cell growth and survival. In addition, mutation of frizzled genes in mice and man implicate the Wnt/beta-catenin and Wnt/Ca2+. pathways in physiological angiogenesis. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway may also affect angiogenesis indirectly, as this branch of the pathway induces angiogenic genes, such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Interleukin-8 (IL-8). We will determine whether Wnts and a new Frizzled ligand, Norrin, can act as angiogenic factors by stimulating cultured endothelial cells to grow, survive, and participate in angiogenic morphogenesis. The Wnt/Frizzled cascades that are activated in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in response to Wnts, Norrin, and Frizzleds will be defined. We hypothesize that Wnt/beta-catenin may promote angiogenesis both directly and indirectly, by inducing VEGF or IL-8 in mural cells that, in turn, stimulate endothelial cells. Wnt/beta-catenin function in vascular development will be studied using mouse models that conditionally activate or inactivate signaling in either endothelial or mural cells. A negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, Axin, will be used to interfere with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in vivo. To activate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, we will express a stabilized form of beta-catenin specifically and conditionally in the vasculature. Embryonic and adult viability will be assessed and vascular morphogenesis, angiogenesis and vascular function will be analyzed. These studies will define how aberrant Wnt/Frizzled signaling might contribute to vascular pathologies and diseases, such as familial exuditive vitreoretinopathy."

1225,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Voltage-gated Ca channels convert electrical signals into intracellular Ca signals that are paramount for a variety of cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction and gene expression. Ca channels trigger these processes by opening in response to electrical stimulation, thus allowing Ca ions to flow into the cell where they act as signaling molecules that are detected by Ca binding proteins. L-type Ca channels, one subset of the Ca channel superfamily, are the target proteins for a number of drugs including the dihydropyridines (DHPs). DHPs are an important class of drugs, used extensively to treat angina, hypertension and stroke. DHPs modulate Ca channel gating, but the molecular details that link DHP binding to changes in Ca channel gating are not known. We have found that the DHP receptor site and a Ca binding site in the pore exhibit cooperativity and are allosterically coupled. Ca binding to the pore promotes the energetic coupling between two amino acid residues located in the pore and DHP antagonists disrupt this coupling. This finding is intriguing given that gating for several types of ion channels is linked to structural rearrangements in their respective pore regions. We hypothesize that conformational changes that occur upon DHP binding are transduced to the pore where gating is altered. By studying the allosteric interactions between Ca and DHP binding, we intend to identify important molecular interactions that link DHP binding to changes in channel gating. We are integrating several techniques, including whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, kinetic modeling and radioligand binding to develop a deep understanding of how DHPs modulate the gating behavior of L-type Ca channels. Results from these studies are expected to facilitate the rational design of new classes of drugs that modulate the gating behavior of Ca channels. This application is divided into four Specific Aims: 1. Identify interacting amino acid pairs in the Ca channel pore. 2. Identify changes in gating that are dependent on Ca binding to the channel pore. 3. Clarify the relationship between Ca and DHP binding and channel block. 4. Develop an allosteric-kinetic scheme that links DHP- and Ca- binding to Ca channel gating."
1251,HHS,HHS,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a major regulator of blood pressure and electrolyte balancein animals and humans. Renin is the rate limiting enzyme of the RAS cascade and its synthesis ishighly regulated at both the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and secretory level. Despite yearsof investigation, our understanding of the mechanisms regulating renin gene expression remainedvery incomplete. The purpose of this proposal therefore is to test the overall hypothesis that theenhancers found upstream of the renin gene along with their cognate transcription factors (andspecific ligands), co-activators, and co-repressors play a major role in controlling the cell- andtissue-specificity of expression and the transcriptional responses to physiological cues. To testand expand upon this hypothesis we have developed the following three main specific aims: 1) testthe hypothesis that individual transcription factors identified to bind to the renin enhancer areimportant modulators of renin promoter/enhancer activity and endogenous renin expression atbaseline, and under conditions where renin expression is either stimulated or repressed, 2) test thehypothesis that two enhancers of transcription, the kidney enhancer (KE) and chorionic enhancer(CE) in the human renin 5' flanking region are essential elements controlling tissue- and cell-specific expression and the responses to physiological cues, and 3) test the hypothesis that thetranscription factors Ear2 (a negative regulator) and RARa (a positive regulator) are majordeterminants of renin expression in whole animals. With the development of new innovativetechnologies for interrogation of individual genes and proteins in both cells and whole animals, weare now poised for the first time to make important discoveries linking transcriptional events tospecific physiological responses andpathways."
1278,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A series of recent reports call for the development of new competencies for health care. But how does one assess competency and, even more fundamentally, what does it mean to be 'competent'? Medical schools and licensing agencies are confronted daily with the task of evaluating and certifying professional competence using a set of practices and technologies that have evolved over time. The Competency Project seeks to foster foundational inquiry into the components, cognitive and interactional, underlying such assessments of professional competence. Our interest is in unpacking what is actually measured in consequential practical exams widely used in medical education and licensure. Becoming more articulate about what we mean by clinical competence may lead to suggestions for improving both professional training and its assessment. Subjects, medical students and residents participating as paid volunteers, will be asked to interview and examine a standardized patient (SP) who will be trained to present a case taken from psychiatric practice. Afterwards, they will construct a SOAP (Subjective and Objective findings, Assessment, and Plan) note at a computer station and will participate in a debriefing interview. We will build a collection of samples of graded practice by applying standard methods of assessment for performance-based assessment to the data gathered from the subjects' encounters with the standardized patient. Under the scope of this R03 proposal we seek funding to achieve the following specific aims: 1) To expand our existing collection of graded professional practice by (a) developing a new case in psychiatry, (b) training a standardized patient (SP), and (c) running a set of subjects and 2) to evaluate several promising analytic frameworks for studying this pilot data. Three specific frameworks will be evaluated: an analysis focusing on reasoning patterns (Cognitive Protocol Analysis), an analysis focusing on the sequential organization of the talk (Interactional Analysis), and an analysis that blends the study of cognition and interaction while focusing on knowledge structures (Cognitive Discourse Analysis)."
1287,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of the embryonic gonad is the first critical step in determining the reproductive functionality of the adult individual. Sexual ambiguity, infertility, or neoplasia arises when defects occur in early gonad development. The main goal of this proposal is to understand the fundamental process of gonad development, especially as regards the development of the ovary. Development of the mammalian ovary is considered as a default pathway, arising only in the absence of Sry-directed testis pathway. However, our recent findings revealed that the development of the ovary is a product of an active signaling cascade, involving complex cell-cell interaction and cell fate determination. We have identified two novel molecules, WNT4 and follistatin, that play critical roles during early ovary development. Wnt4 and follistatin null mice had identical defects in embryonic ovaries including formation of a testis-specific vasculature and loss of germ cells. Furthermore, we found that follistatin is the direct downstream effector of WNT4 to regulate the vasculature and germ cell development. We therefore hypothesize that WNT4 and follistatin are constituents of a novel signaling cascade to inhibit testis-specific vasculature and to maintain the survival of female germ cells in ovary development. We propose three specific aims to: 1) dissect the intracellular signaling pathways of WNT4; 2) understand the regulation and functions of follistatin in ovary development; and 3) establish the functional relationship between formation of the testis specific vasculature and germ cell loss in follistatin null gonads. By combining transgenic and organ culture techniques, we expect to decipher the molecular and cellular pathways for the development of the ovary and at the same time, identify the critical components susceptible to genetic defects in these pathways."
1301,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We aim to extend our understanding of the structure and function of cytochrome P450 and other heme protein systems by using pump-probe kinetics and time resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy over a wide dynamic range in time (ps-ms). Development of a unique temporally stabilized, and electronically tunable, two-color picosecond laser system will enable both the transient Raman and the kinetic studies. Femtosecond coherence spectroscopy (FCS), which is a direct and unique probe of the coherent protein/cofactor vibrational motion induced by electronic transitions associated with biochemical reactions, will also be utilized in studies of the biochemical reaction coordinates as well as the global protein response. One specific hypothesis to be tested addresses the reason behind the anomalously low femtosecond quantum yield for O2 photolysis and the potential for a transient side-on oxygen binding geometry that arises because of the participation of ligand bending modes in the reaction coordinate for dissociation. Vibrationally hot six coordinate oxymyoglobin species have already been detected using white light continuum probes, and we propose to extend such studies to the P450 system and its catalytic intermediates as well as to expand the probe capability to include picosecond Raman scattering techniques. Experiments at low temperature will also be carried out using newly developed optical techniques. These experiments will include the first picosecond and femtosecond studies of geminate ligand recombination as a function of temperature. Exploratory work with the Raman microscope will continue with spatially specific probes of mitochondria and with studies of P450 embedded in membrane nanodiscs.     Overall this project has a wide range of health related implications involving cytochrome P450 in particular and heme proteins in general. Many chemotherapeutic agents as well as polycyclic carcinogens are metabolized by P450 systems. Moreover, all metabolic disorders involving a P450 protein must relate to this research, since a fundamental understanding of the active site structure and function of P450 at the molecular level will result in a better insight for those concerned with treatment of these disorders at any level."
1307,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysfunction of the endothelium dependent relaxation factor/nitric oxide (EDRF/NO) in blood vessels accompanies salt sensitive hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) impairs EDRF/NO either by competing with the NOS substrate, L-arginine for membrane transport via system y+, or by competitive inhibition of NOS. Therefore, ADMA could underlie defective EDRF/NO responses that contribute to cardiovascular disease. However, the normal regulation of ADMA has not been extensively studied. ADMA is metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAH-1 and -2). We have found that DDAH-2 is heavily expressed in the kidney, especially in the macula densa cells and distal nephron. DDAH-1 is heavily expressed in the vascular endothelium and proximal tubules. Our studies show that Angiotensin II upregulate DDAH-2 (and thereby may reduce macula densa ADMA) but downregulates DDAH-1 (and thereby may increase endothelial ADMA). Dietary salt restriction and early insulinopenic DM both impairs EDRF/NO. This defect can be overcome by excess arginine, suggesting that NO may be inhibited by ADMA. Indeed, we have found that salt restriction decreases plasma arginine, yet increases plasma ADMA and impairs the EDRF/NO responses to acetylcholine of isolated mesenteric resistance vessels. In contrast, we have found that DM increases renal DDAH-2 expression, leading to reduced renal ADMA levels. A consequent increase in macula densa NO could block the vasoconstrictive tubuloglomrular feedback (TGF) response and thereby vasodilate the renal afferent arteriole selectively, leading to glomerular hyperfiltration. We propose to test the hypothesis that arginine delivery, transport and metabolism by NOS in the kidneys and microvascular resistance vessels is differentially regulated by DDAH thereby leading to site- and cell-specific generation of ADMA and NO during physiologic adaptations to changes in salt intake and pathophysiologic responses to insulinopenic DM. We have developed a gene silencing strategy targeting DDAH-1 and -2 in the rat to test the specific roles of these isoforms in physiologic studies of EDRF/NO in resistance vessels and TGF in the kidney. The first two aims test the hypothesis that dietary salt restriction limits NO generation in vascular endothelium because of a reduction in plasma arginine concentration and a decrease in DDAH-1 activity in endothelial cells. This could reduce the intracellular arginine: ADMA concentration, thereby inhibiting EDRF/NO. We propose to examine the specific roles of angiotensin and mineralocorticosteroid receptors. The third aim tests the hypothesis that during early insulinopenic DM downregulation of DDAH-1 in endothelium underlies the defective EDRF/NO that precedes vasculopathy whereas upregulation of DDAH-2 in the macula densa enhances local NO that blocks the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response causing hvperfiltration that precedes nephropathv."
1343,HHS,HHS,"The overall aim of this project is to gain insight into the inflammatory, oxidative and endothelial controlmechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of short- and long-term exposure to traffic-associated fineparticulate matter (PM). This will be accomplished by investigating in a human population the differentialsusceptibility to PM effects associated with specific genetic polymorphisms that involve these keymechanistic pathways. The aim will be addressed by making efficient use of an ongoing cohort study ofatherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and several MESAancillary studies for which PM and traffic exposure data, genotyping data, and data on multiple relevantcardiovascular endpoints are being collected. The specific aims of this project are to gain insight into themechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of traffic-associated PM by: 1) making use of the MESAcohort to determine whether specific genetic polymorphisms in key pathways regulating inflammation,oxidative stress, and endothelial function modify: a) the long-term exposure effects of traffic-associated PMon the development and progression of atherosclerosis using measures that include arterial wall thicknessand coronary artery calcium, and b) the short-term exposure effects of these PM components on functionalcardiovascular and mechanistic endpoints, including carotid distensibility, pulse wave measures, endothelialfunction, and plasma markers of inflammation and endothelial activation; 2) validating the findings fromSpecific Aim 1 on a newly genotyped sample of MESA participants; and 3) making use of the toxicologicalfindings from Center Project 5 on novel genetic polymorphisms of interest by investigating the modifyingeffects of these additional polymorphisms on long-term and short-term PM exposure effects, and validatingthese findings on the newly genotyped human population sample. This project integrates across all projectsof this center through the choice of both the specific genetic polymorphisms to be investigated in commonwith other projects, and the specific cardiovascular endpoints to be studied. Further integration is evident inthe use of findings from other center projects to guide the choice of polymorphisms to study.Because it employs a representative human population sample of several U.S. ethnic groups to study apervasive and important inhalational exposure and a common disease, this project has direct public healthrelevance. It is currently not known which sources and chemical components of PM are most responsible forits cardiovascular effects, or which of several plausible mechanisms underlie these effects. By contributingto our understanding of mechanisms and the identification of exposure sources of most concern, this projectcan allow more directed and efficient public health policies to be considered."

1411,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Overcoming access barriers associated with limited proficiency in the English language-the  language barrier  - is expected to contribute greatly toward eliminating disparities in access to specialty mental health care. Since 1997, the California Department of Mental Health (DMH) has required that the state's 57 county-operated mental health agencies provide information and services to Medicaid (Medi-Cal) beneficiaries in their primary language when the number of beneficiaries in the county reaches  threshold  levels defined as  3,000 beneficiaries or 5% of the Medi-Cal population, whichever is lower, whose primary language is other than English.  This study will assess the impact of California's threshold language policy requirements (TLPRs) on access and continuity of care for Medi-Cal beneficiaries ages 19-64 over a 72- month period beginning July 1997 and ending June 2003. Specific research questions are: 1) Among non-English speakers, what is the impact of TLPRs on access to specialty mental health care and continuity of care? 2) How is the impact of TLPRs substituted or complemented by broader efforts to serve non-English speaking populations through hiring of bilingual providers and provision of language specific programs? Using panel data regression methods, with the county and month as the unit and period of observation, we will evaluate language-specific differences in access and continuity of care as they relate to differences in implementation of the four TLPRs as well as hiring of bilingual providers and provision of language-specific programs. At the same time, we will control for differences in county sociodemographic environments, mental health systems, as well as changes in access and continuity for English-speaking persons. The analysis will, be carried out using Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health Claims data and Medi-Cal Eligibility data obtained from the California DMH. Other state data sources will be used to measure county and service system characteristics. Primary data will be collected from county cultural competency plans and state compliance review reports documenting each county's implementation of the TLPRs, and the availability of bilingual providers and language-specific programs. Individual in-depth interviews will be conducted by trained bilingual interviewers with limited-English consumers to obtain their perspectives on how the TLPRs, and other county mental health activities, have helped or hindered access to and continuity of mental health care."
1437,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While airway constrictor hyperresponsiveness has long been known as a pathophysiological characteristic of asthma, more recent attention has been placed upon another functional abnormality - the inability of deep breathing to reverse bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects, as it does in normal individuals. Asthmatic airways appear to respond to the stretch imposed by a deep breath in an elastic fashion, returning to their original, constricted diameter soon after release of the deep inhalation. In marked contrast, normal airways when constricted respond to stretch with much more plastic deformation, retaining their stretched circumference and resulting in deep breathing-induced reversal of bronchoconstriction. Ample evidence indicates that plastic or elastic behavior of a constricted airway has its origin in the parallel mechanical properties of its contracted airway smooth muscle. Our major objective is to identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate the plasticity-elasticity balance of contracted airway smooth muscle. The key premises underlying this proposal are that 1) the normal bronchodilation response to a deep inspiration is a large effect, 2) this response is abrogated in asthma, and 3) if we understood the molecular mechanisms underlying this response and its failure in asthma, then novel interventions could be designed to restore this bronchodilation mechanism in asthmatics, and could represent an important new therapeutic strategy. We have developed a novel model system that facilitates study of the plasticity-elasticity balance of contracted airway smooth muscle, which in we find that the shortening that occurred during isotonic contraction is reversed by the addition of load fluctuations, and that this relengthening happens on two time scales - within a few seconds ( immediate phase ) and over the entire 20 min of force oscillation ( slow phase ); additional studies implicate different signaling pathways and different effector molecules in the regulation of each phase of relengthening. This model system thus reveals that multiple (at least 2) molecular mechanisms determine overall plasticity of contracted airway smooth muscle, and it provides a platform for their separate study. Using this system, we propose two specific aims designed to identify the signaling pathways and effector molecules that regulate two easily discernible contributions to the overall plasticity of contracted airway smooth muscle. We anticipate that understanding these molecular mechanisms may shed light onto potential dysregulation of these pathways in airway smooth muscle in asthma, and so may suggest strategies by which to restore the powerful endogenous protective deep breath-induced bronchodilation that is lost in asthma."
1447,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent surveys indicate that approximately 26 - 27 million individuals in the US suffer from moderate to severe chronic pain. A key pathophysiology of chronic pain is neurogenic inflammation, which is primarily elicited by activation of unmyelinated sensory neurons through noxious stimuli and the subsequent release of neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) from the peripheral endings of these nociceptive neurons. Neurogenic inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various human diseases or syndromes with uncertain etiology, such as migraines, arthritis and complex regional pain syndrome. Animal studies suggest that released CGRP acting at its receptors may be critical in the etiology of neurogenic dural vasodilation, thought to be a critical link in the generation of migraine and other neurovascular pain. Recent clinical trials with a CGRP antagonist provide substantive support for this theory. Currently, the established selective CGRP receptor antagonist is the C-terminal fragment of the human a-CGRP (hCGRP8-37). Since hCGRP8-37 is not a small molecule, the delivery of this large peptide to neurogenic inflammatory sites represents a great challenge. We propose to use a microneedle-based technology to transdermally infuse hCGRP8-37 into an inflamed site of skin area of rats without the use of a standard needle and syringe. Unlike other microneedles, our microneedles are made of biocompatible water-dissolving  generally recognized as safe  (GRAS) materials and impregnated with the biomolecule to be delivered, in this case hCGRP8-37. The microneedles penetrate the skin and dissolve in the interstitial fluid while delivering the biomolecule. Thus, we will take advantage of this novel drug delivery technology and the in-depth pain research expertise from our collaborator, Dr. David Yeomans at Stanford University, to develop and test an innovative anti-CGRP microneedle patch. Our Specific Aims are to - 1. Fabricate the dissolvable microneedle patch incorporating hCGRP8-37 and determine the antagonist release kinetics from the microneedles using acutely prepared rat cadaver skin in vitro. 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the anti-CGRP microneedle patch in a neurogenic inflammatory pain model in rats using pain behavior assessments and oedema measurements. The objective of this Phase I project is to test the hypothesis that the dissolvable microneedle patch can deliver the CGRP receptor antagonist in a slow sustained diffusion manner into neurogenically inflamed sites, and consequently block hyperalgesia and oedema in the capsaicin neurogenic inflammation rat model. Our ultimate goal is to develop safe, effective and convenient microneedle patches to block peripheral CGRP receptor-mediated nociceptive and inflammatory responses that occur under pathologic, neurogenic pain conditions. Recent surveys indicate that approximately 26 - 27 million individuals in the US suffer from moderate to severe pain. One of major causes of pain is neurogenic inflammation which is associated with chronic pain syndromes such as migraines, arthritis and complex regional pain syndrome. Animal studies suggest that the pain is related to CGRP release, which can be prevented by a sustained supply of anti-CGRP to the inflammation sites. We propose the development of an innovative anti-CGRP patch for the treatment of neurogenic inflammatory pain."
1455,HHS,NSF,"The project entitled  Immune recognition of glycolipids  fits into a collaborative Program Project byaddressing biochemical and structural questions that complement biological studies led by Dr.Bendelac, andby using extensively chemical compounds developed in collaboration with Dr.Savage. Our 3 Specific Aimswill be: Lipid Transfer Proteins (LTPs). We will examine the contribution of saposins A through D,Niemann-Pick type C-2 and GM2 activator protein in the shaping of the repertoire of lipids presented by CD1molecules in professional antigen presenting cells. In vivo studies in knock-out mice will evaluate thecontribution of each protein in the selection of NKT cells as well as in anti-bacterial responses. In vitrostudies will attempt to reconstitute the complex situation of the lysosome where CD1 resides with a mixtureof small LTPs and a wide spectrum of glycolipids. Biophysical measurements and structural studies will alsoattempt to understand the mechanisms of transfer of lipids between CD1 and LTPs using real time FRETand SPR. Extracellular Lipid Transport and Uptake. Extracellular lipids are kept in solution by associatingwith lipoproteins particles or lipid transport proteins. The delivery of immunogenic lipids, such as bacteriallipids, follows some of the same trafficking pathways. We will determine which pathway are important forknown agonists of NKT cells such as a-galactosyl ceramide (a-GalCer) and bacterial glucuronyl ceramides.The identification of transport proteins will be driven by the usage of biotinylated compounds andbiochemistry. Lipid uptake and trafficking to the lysosome will be determined by cell biology and the usage ofknock-out mice for surface receptors. The consequences of in vivo modifications, such as oxidation thataccompanies inflammation, will also be studied with respect to transport. Finally, we will attempt some of theknowledge gained by this specific aim to devise new strategies for delivering lipid antigens in vivo.Structural Studies of CD1 recognition by Va14 T cell receptors. We know from experience that thisapproach is highly unpredictable but we also know that it is unlikely that a sustained effort will not deliversome results. This approach has allowed us to determine important structures such as CD1 bound to a-GalCer but more structures are required. The main goal of this aim is to understand the ability of Va14 TCRsto recognize ligands as different as CD1-iGb3 and CD1.-a-GalCer. To attain this goal new proteinengineering is required and will be exposed in details. Strong preliminary results will help us in the design ofthese experiments. Additional CD1-lipid structures studies will also be proposed to understand the influenceof acyl chain unsaturation and head group modifications. Finally, we will also carry the systematicmutagenesis of the Va14 chain to understand the thermodynamics of the reaction Va14/CD1."
1503,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies from the laboratory of the PI have focused on elucidating the components, mechanisms, and roles of bioactive sphingolipids, especially ceramide with its emerging roles in regulating cell growth, differentiation, senescence, and inflammation. However, the study of these pathways has been complicated by their multiplicity, metabolic interactions, sub cellular compartmentalization, and lack of molecular tools. These considerations led us to the overall hypothesis that the specific cellular functions of ceramide are dictated by the sub cellular site of ceramide generation which in turn depends on which of the enzymes of ceramide metabolism regulates its site-specific formation. In this proposal we will focus on the neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) pathway and address the following aims: 1) To define cellular mechanisms of regulation of nSMase2. We will investigate the specific hypothesis that defined signaling pathways lead to the activation/regulation of n-SMase2 in response to TNF action. This will be approached by defining the regulation of translocation of nSMase2 by TNF, and determining the cellular mechanisms that regulate this translocation. 2) To determine molecular and biochemical mechanisms of activation of nSMaseZ. We will determine the mechanisms by which nSMase2 interacts with phosphatidylserine, an activating lipid, and we will determine the mechanisms of phosphorylation and palmitoylation and their roles in activation and translocation of nSMase2. 3) To determine the role of nSMase2 in generating a specific 'pool' of ceramide with specific downstream functions. We will test the specific hypothesis that nSMase2 acts on a distinct pool of sphingomyelin that resides in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, leading to the corresponding subset of ceramide, with its own specific functions. Taken together, these results should provide a foundation for the study of molecularly-distinct sphingolipid-mediated pathways of cell regulation. Moreover, molecular studies on nSMase2 would also impact our understanding of the mechanisms of an emerging and novel family of phospholipid phosphodiesterases. These pathways are of direct significance to the biology of stress responses and specifically to cancer biology and inflammation."
1505,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against many self-antigens resulting in systemic blood vessel and target organ inflammation.  Data from the available genome-wide microsatellite screens suggest that multiple genes contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE. Although classic linkage analysis is quite effective in identifying rare variants with a strong genetic effect, this approach has limited power to detect more common variants with modest penetrance.  Thus, we hypothesize that many alleles important for the SLE phenotype will not be identified through genome screens. Our overall objective in the current proposal is to take a novel  candidate pathway  association approach to the identification of genes and gene variants that contribute to SLE. SLE shows a striking female predominance with approximately a 10:1 female:male case ratio. Together with other data indicating an important role for sex steroids in the pathogenesis of SLE, we propose to examine coding region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the haplotype structure of 44 sex steroid pathway genes for evidence of association. For this, we will type our MN family collection, which currently is comprised of 250 sib-pair families, 300 trio families (single SLE patient with both parents), and a case control cohort of 300 cases and matched controls. Recent data from the Behrens laboratory have shown that about 70% of individuals with SLE carry a characteristic interferon-induced gene expression signature in their peripheral blood cells. Interestingly, this signature is observed in nearly all patients with the most severe type of lupus. We hypothesize that activation of the interferon pathway reflects allelic variation within the pathway that predisposes to disease. We will identify and then type coding SNPs and haplotypes within genes from this pathway for association with SLE. Finally, our group has recently identified a mutation in the CD40 gene that is strongly associated with SLE. CD40 is a key receptor on B cells and dendritic cells which is important for T-dependent immune and inflammatory responses. The identified mutation is a  gain of-function  polymorphism that  pre-loads  the cytoplasmic tail of CD40 with the signaling protein TRAF2. Cells carrying this mutation show altered signaling. We propose to screen additional molecules within the CD40 pathway, and other key members of the TNF receptor gene family, for additional polymorphisms associated with SLE. All putative associations will be replicated in a large cohort of 2,000 SLE cases and 2,000 controls.    This project is a collaboration between the SLE genetics group at the University of Minnesota and the Broad Institute/Massachusetts General Hospital. The Broad Institute is one of the primary centers for the genome wide haplotype mapping (hap-map) project. Thus, the current study will have access to state-of-the-art methods for identification of relevant haplotypes, and for genotyping and data analysis. We anticipate that the proposed studies will lead to the identification of novel alleles that contribute to human SLE, and that this new knowledge will translate rapidly to better diagnosis and treatment of this important disease."
1535,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-cardiac pulmonary edema is a frequent affliction in pulmonary medicine and is caused by endothelial barrier dysfunction. It is now recognized that this dysfunction may be initiated by programmed cell signaling as opposed to non-specific disruption of the vascular barrier. Since the endothelial barrier is known to be altered by exposure to hypoxia leading to pulmonary edema, we have utilized a rat pulmonary artery microvascular endothelial cell (EC) monolayer culture model to study the effects of hypoxia on EC barrier function. Preliminary studies have led to the hypothesis that exposure to hypoxia initiates cell signaling through the p38 MAP kinase pathway involving MK2 and HSP27 activation that leads to actin cytoskeleton and hic-5 redistribution. These signaling events are associated with an alteration in biomechanical  tethering  and  stiffness  and enhanced permeability of the EC monolayer.  Tethering  may be regulated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway while  stiffness  is regulated by Rho/Rho kinase and myosin light chain phosphorylation. We plan in the present proposal to study these responses more thoroughly in the rat pulmonary artery microvascular EC monolayer and to perform confirmatory studies in similar cells from human pulmonary microvasculature. In addition, we will investigate these signaling pathways in mice in vivo using pharmacological inhibitors, as well as mice in which the expression of MK2, a key kinase in the p38 pathway, has been  knocked-out . Specifically, we plan to: Aim 1: Define signaling pathways important for mediating cytoskeletal changes in endothelial cell monolayers exposed to hypoxia; Aim 2: Determine the relevance of the biomechanical endpoints  stiffness  and  tethering , which increase with exposure to hypoxia, to physiological determinants of endothelial barrier function; and Aim 3: Evaluate the signaling events that lead to increased pulmonary endothelial permeability in hypoxia in vivo. The findings of this study are expected to further our understanding of mechanisms involved in the development of endothelial barrier dysfunction, in general, and to suggest targets for treatment of pulmonary edema."
1546,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess mortality among persons with severe mental illness (SMI) is documented consistently, yet higher suicide rates only partially explain this mortality difference. Previous research has focused little attention on the contribution of somatic disease or poor quality care to mortality in persons with SMI, who likely are at higher risk than others for poorer quality care, including adverse events. This study will utilize and extend an existing NIMH-funded community-based cohort of 6,235 adults with SMI, ages 21-62 in 1993, enrolled in Maryland Medicaid, and followed from fiscal years 1994-2000. Matching to the National Death Index revealed over 18% (N=1142) have died at a mean age of only 51 years. This magnitude of early mortality, almost 3 times the expected rate for Maryland residents, is alarming. A retrospective study is proposed to examine potentially preventable causes of mortality in persons with SMI. In Maryland Medicaid cohorts of 6,235 adults with SMI and 30,000 disabled adults without SMI our Specific Aims are: 1) Estimate the relative risk of mortality from specific health problems (alcohol and substance abuse, injury and chronic medical conditions); 2) Examine the relative risk of mortality associated with poor quality of care for coronary artery disease, diabetes, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. In the SMI cohort we will then: 3) Examine the risk of in-hospital mortality or mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge associated with the occurrence of adverse events in medical and surgical hospitalizations; and 4) Compare the occurrence and types of adverse events to a completed state-of-the art patient safety study of admissions to general hospitals. Specific Aims 1 and 2 will implement a longitudinal analysis of Medicaid administrative data through 2004 and apply quality of care indicators for chronic conditions. Specific Aim 3 will use a case-crossover design where adverse events from hospital records around the time of death will be compared to those in a randomly selected earlier hospitalization for the same subject. Specific Aim 4 will compare adverse event data in Specific Aim 3 to a patient safety study in the general population using the same chart abstraction instrument. This innovative study will illuminate factors contributing to premature death in the SMI that may be amenable to improved quality of care, and/or improved patient safety, and will provide a basis for prioritizing interventions to improve longevity in the SMI."
1569,HHS,NSF,"Relevance Cells show extraordinary diversity in size and shape. Generation of diverse sizes and shapes requiresregulation of the amount and location of growth, as well as coordination of growth with the cell cycle. Themechanisms by which cells regulate and coordinate growth in the context of the cell cycle are poorlyunderstood. The focus of our work is to use budding yeast as a model system to understand how cell growthis coordinated with the cell cycle. It is likely that the mechanisms used by budding yeast to coordinategrowth with the cell cycle are relevant to all eukaryotic cells. In addition, these mechanisms are potentialtargets for new drugs aimed at blocking the proliferation of cancer cells.Summary In budding yeast, growth of a new daughter cell is initiated in G1 by the activity of cyclin-dependentkinase 1 (Cdk1). It is thought that Cdk1 initiates growth of a new cell by activating a highly conservedsignaling module that includes the Cdc42 GTPase. The molecular mechanisms by which Cdk1 activates theCdc42 signaling module have remained elusive. In our preliminary studies, we have shown that keycomponents of the Cdc42 signaling module are direct targets of Cdk1. A major goal of this proposal is totest the hypothesis that phosphorylation of these proteins represents a direct link between Cdk1 activity andthe initiation of new cell growth. A second cyclin-dependent kinase called Pho85 also plays a role in initiation of cell growth in G1;however the downstream targets of Pho85 that control cell growth are poorly understood. Our preliminarystudies suggest that the Shs1 septin is an important and direct target of Pho85. Moreover, we haveidentified a Pho85-dependent signaling network that is required for regulation of cell growth. The secondmajor goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of Shs1 by Pho85 is a critical step inthe Pho85-dependent signaling network. We will also characterize the roles of additional proteins thatfunction in the network."
1610,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective is to elucidate the androgen pathway, a cascade of molecular and cellular events triggered by androgen manipulation leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, and/or apoptosis in the prostate. U19/Eaf2 (U19), initially identified as a novel androgen-induced gene, is a key molecule in the androgen pathway. U19 overexpression induces apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in culture and in xenografts. U19 down-regulation and loss-of-heterozygosity were detected in >80% of human advanced prostate cancer specimens. We have generated U19 knockout (KO) mice, which developed lymphoma, nepatocellular carcinoma, and poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma. This demonstrated that U19 is a tumor suppressor. The U19 KO prostate exhibited epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia, suggesting that U19 contributes to the suppression of prostate tumors. Interestingly, U19 KO increased the size of prostate epithelial cells, indicating that U19 is essential in cell size control. U19 was independently identified and termed ELL-associated factor (Eaf2), based on its association with ELL, a fusion partner of MLL in acute myeloid leukemia. Preliminary studies showed that the ELL-binding region of U19 is critical for apoptosis induction. The above observations support our hypothesis that U19 regulates androgen-dependent prostate epithelial homeostasis and that ELL is required for U19 action. Three specific aims will elucidate the role and mechanisms of U19 action in the prostate in vivo. 1. Test the hypothesis that loss of U19 disrupts homeostasis of full-grown prostate in the presence of androgens but does not affect undeveloped prostate naive to androgens. Markers for differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation will be examined in U19 KO and wild-type prostate in the absence and in the presence of androgens. 2. Test the hypothesis that U19 and Pten. Two commonly inactivated/down-regulated genes in human prostate cancer, functionally cooperate in suppression of prostate tumors in mice. The effect of U19 deletion or overexpression on Pten KO prostate will be determined. 3. Determine the role of ELL, a U19 binding partner, in U19 action in the prostate. Prostate-specific ELL KO mice will be generated and cross-bred with the U19 KO or transgenic mice to examine the role of ELL and the importance of U19-ELL interaction in vivo. Androgens play important roles in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), two major diseases in American men at old age. Elucidating the androgen pathway in the prostate will provide insights into the mechanisms by which androgens influence BPH and prostate cancer, leading to more effective prevention and treatment of the diseases."
1684,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perfect coordination of the extent and timing of cellular proliferation with terminal differentiation is a genetically controlled process, fundamental for the development of all tissues and organ systems.  Deregulations of this tightly regulated process can cause human birth defects and neoplastic transformation.  Pbx1 is a homeodomain protein that collaboratively binds DNA with Hox proteins to modulate their DNA binding specificities and is a homolog of Drosophila extradenticle (EXD), whose function in patterning the fly body plan has been demonstrated genetically.  Our ongoing efforts and long-term goals utilize genetically modified mouse models to assess the contributions of the Pbx family of Hox cofactors to mammalian patterning and morphogenesis.  In embryos, the lack of Pbx1 (Pbx1-l-) results in late gestational lethality, widespread patterning defects of the axial and appendicular skeleton, homeotic transformation of second branchial arch neural crest cell-derived skeletal structures, markedly diminished chondrocyte proliferation, accompanied by precocious chondrocyte hypertrophy, and premature ossification of bone.  Unlike Pbx1-l-, both Pbx2 -l-and Pbx3-l- mice do not display gross abnormalities either in patterning or in skeletal development/maturation. Nonetheless, Pbx1-l-; Pbx2-l- mutants die earlier in utero and show drastic exacerbation of the skeletal defects.  The goal of this proposal is to finely dissect the genetic control of patterning and skeletal development by the homeobox gene Pbx1, through the following specific aims: 1) genetically uncouple the early roles of Pbxl in patterning from its later roles in cartilage proliferation, differentiation and endochondral ossification, through the generation of knockout mice where Pbxl is inactivated in a tissue-specific manner in neural crest and chondrocytes, by utilizing available Cre mice; 2) characterize the role of Pbx1 in chondrocyte proliferation by using genetically modified (Pbx1-l-) mesenchymal cells in culture, such as Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs), which show a striking growth defect, and Micromass Mesenchyme Cultures; 3) identify unique and overlapping functions of Pbx1 with the related family member Pbx2 in skeletal development and also exclusively in the genetic control of chondrogenesis.  Completion of these studies will advance our understanding of the genetic regulation of patterning and skeletal development by Pbx1.  Under a broader perspective, this work will shed light on the dramatic effects of the perturbations of skeletal development and hopefully impact on our understanding of the pathogenesis of human birth defects that affect the development of the craniofacial, axial and appendicular skeleton."
1715,HHS,HHS,"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils must respond to multiple exogenous stimuli to proceed through the complex transformation from quiescence to activated phenotypes. The plasma membrane is the interface where this transformation must be initiated. Recent work has shown that plasma membranes are heterogeneous structures containing discrete regions,  lipid raft microdomains , enriched in glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, lipid-anchored receptors, and signaling molecules. Selective partitioning into lipid rafts appears to be a key mechanism for imposing organization on the distribution of proteins in the plasma membrane, thereby compartmentalizing discrete functions within the plasma membrane and, in essence, creating a syntax that translates otherwise dissociated signaling effectors into a meaningful language of signal transduction. The central hypothesis underlying this proposal is that the composition, structural integrity, and spatial distribution of lipid raft microdomains critically regulate key processes in neutrophil activation. Our preliminary studies of human neutrophils have shown that lipid rafts: i) spatially compartmentalize and selectively regulate neutrophil activation signaling, ii) selectively influence cellular responsiveness to proinflammatory agonists, and iii) regulate signal propagation during cell migration. The long-term objective of this project is to determine how the function and composition of lipid raft microdomains regulate the antimicrobial and proinflammatory functions of neutrophils. The short-term objectives are to: i) determine the mechanisms by which lipid rafts influence agonist-specific signal transduction, ii) determine how lipid rafts regulate the production and release of reactive oxygen intermediates, iii) determine how lipid rafts influence the expression, distribution, and function of (32 integrins, and iv) determine how lipid rafts control cellular polarity and calcium signaling during non-directional and chemotaxin-driven migration. Hopefully, targeting the function of lipid raft microdomains will engender new therapeutic strategies for enhancing antimicrobial defenses and suppressing the deleterious effects of acute inflammation."
1726,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nitric oxide (NO) deficiency occurs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) irrespective of the primary cause and contributes to the cardiovascular complications and progression of CKD. There are many reasons for NO deficiency in CKD; 1 major factor is accumulation of the endogenous NOS inhibitor, asymmetric dimethylarginine, ADMA, due partly to a failure of the hydrolyzing enzymes dimethylarginine dimethylamino-hydrolases (DDAHs). The kidney is a major site of DDAH activity. Another cause is loss of NO synthase (NOS) protein and activity and our work suggests that in kidney the neuronal (n)NOS is a primary target and that several isoforms are present and altered by CKD. We propose in vivo and in vitro studies in 2 separate models of CKD, the 5/6 renal mass ablation/infarction (A/I) and chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) models to determine the pattern of change of the different NOS and DDAH enzymes in the kidney and how this contributes to the progression of CKD and development of hypertension. Both DDAH and NOS protein abundance and activity are severely compromised by oxidative stress, which is high in CKD and we will use apocyanin to inhibit oxidant production and dietary manipulation to enhance oxidative stress as methods of changing DDAH and NOS activity. Nephron number is a major determinant of progression of CKD and development of hypertension and we will determine how reductions in nephron number impact on the renal NOS and DDAH enzymes. By using our newly developed method of selective kidney transfection with genes of interest we will manipulate the local intrarenal NOS and DDAH enzymes to determine the role of different nNOS (and other NOS) isoforms and the 2 DDAH isoforms in progression of CKD. We will conduct in vivo functional studies in the conscious rat as well as glomerular micropuncture using anesthetized preparations. We will also conduct a range of in vitro studies to determine enzyme location, abundance and activity. Studies will be in the Sprague Dawley rat a strain vulnerable to CKD and hypertension and in the Wistar Furth which is protected from multiple types of CKD and hypertension to gain insights into mechanisms of progression. The incidence of CKD is rapidly increasing in the US and these patients also have a very high rate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, which is clearly linked to NO deficiency. These proposed studies will determine the role of the renal NO system in the progression of CKD and its cardiovascular complications which will lead to new therapeutic approaches."
1755,HHS,HHS,"The field of evolutionary biology has long been interested in the molecular basis of morphological evolution; howevera clear understandingremains elusive. Abdominal pigmentation in the subgroup Drosophilinae is a well studiedtraitsuitable for studies to identify the genetic changes culminating in the emergence of similar and diversepigmentationpatterns. In addition to diverse pigmentation patternsit is apparent, based on phylogeny, that similar patternsofpigmentation haveappeared independently. In the melanogaster speciesgroup sexually dimorphic, segmentspecificpigmentation has recently evolved. The terminal abdominal segmentsof males are dark, whereas all segmentsarelightly pigmentedin females. Closely related groups of species are monomorphic, i.e. all segments are lightly pigmentedin both sexes. In all species, pigmentation is prevented where the gene products of bric-a-brac (bab), a represserofpigmentation, are expressed. In dimorphic species, a newly evolved circuitry involving homeotic and sex-determinationinputs repressesbab expression in the terminal segments of the male, but not the female. This proposal will analyzehow Drosophila melanogaster bab gene regulatory elements has evolvedto integrate responsiveness to homeotic andsex-determination inputs and the extent that both similar and diverse abdominal pigmentation patterns haveevolvedthrough the modification of orthologous bab sequences. Insight from the mechanisms of enhancer evolution andfunction in Drosophilinae will very likely apply to the understandingof cis-regulatoryelements in vertebrates as similarsequence alterationshave significant medical implications inhumans."
1761,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant:  Smooth muscle plays an essential role in a wide variety of physiological processes, from the regulation of blood pressure by controlling vessel diameter in the periphery, to digestive processes by controlling mechanical movement of food though the gut, to reproductive functions by controlling penile erection and delivery of the fetus at birth, to regulation of lung capacity through regulation of airway diameter. A major factor governing the contractile state of all smooth muscles is the phosphorylation level of myosin light chain (LC20). In smooth muscle, steady state phosphorylation of LC20 is dictated by the opposing activities of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and myosin phosphatase (SMPP-1M). Inhibition of SMPP-1M activity through G protein coupled receptors acting through the small GTP binding protein RhoA has been shown to bring about calcium sensitization smooth muscle. Alterations in the sensitivity of various smooth muscles to calcium is hypothesized to be an underlying cause associated with many diseases associated with smooth muscle dysfunction such as hypertension, bronco spasm, sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal disorders and glaucoma. Therefore signaling elements controlling myosin dephosphorylation state may represent attractive points of therapeutic intervention in a variety of human diseases associated with smooth muscle dysfunction. Recently our laboratory identified MYPT1 kinase (MYPT1 K) as a co-localizing SMPP-1M kinase that selectively phosphorylated the myosin targeting subunit (MYPT1) of the phosphatase and the inhibitor protein CPI17 to inhibit activity. Addition of constitutively active forms of MYPT1 K to permeabilized smooth muscles causes profound calcium sensitization through inhibition of SMPP-1M activity. In smooth muscle, MYPT1K is activated in response to a variety of calcium-sensitizing agonists and this activation can be blocked with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. These findings suggest MYPT1K mediates calcium-sensitizing signals from Rho kinase to SMPP-1M, however, the mechanisms by which MYPT1K is regulated in smooth muscle are unknown, since the protein kinase is not a direct substrate for Rho kinase in vitro. In this proposal we will employ a unique blend of muscle physiology, mass spectrometry, molecular biology, small interfering RNA's and small molecule chemistry to determine the molecular mechanisms by which Rho dependant signaling pathways bring about activation of MYPT1K in smooth muscle."
1788,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: This is an extensive revision of our prior application which makes better use of the opportunities of the Danish longitudinal registers and gives us a robust power for testing our highly novel hypothesis that aeroallergens and allergy are associated with suicide. Issues of temporal and topographic clustering have been addressed, the focus of the design has been tightened and more details are given regarding the analysis. Background: Seasonal peaks of suicide in spring have been consistently reported but the origin is poorly understood. Benefiting from a natural experiment (the abrupt rise of tree-pollen in spring), and considering the high prevalence of allergic sensitization (40-50%), we proposed that the massive release of tree-pollen in spring, via mediators of inflammation, elevates the relative risk for suicide, by affecting individuals with vulnerability for allergies, depression, and suicide. The aims of the study are 1) to confirm the relationship between allergen peaks and suicide peaks (using an ecologic approach and a generalized linear model allowing us to address geographic and temporal clustering), 2) to estimate a predictive association between allergy and suicide, with adjustment for and interaction with variables previously described to be related to suicide, such as diagnosis of mood disorders, prior suicide attempts, and other demographic /socioeconomic variables related to suicide risk, using a nested case control design and conditional logistic regression models , and 3) to estimate the predictive association between spring allergy, and spring suicide during peak tree-pollen periods in interaction with history of mood disorders using conditional logistic regression models. Secondary aims are to analyze specifically the predictive association between allergy and mood disorders and suicidal attempts in individuals and families, to evaluate interactions with demographic and socioeconomic factors, and to estimate protective versus risk elevating effects of (anti-allergy and psychotropic) medications. Implications: The study is poised to identify a potential novel vulnerability for suicide, i.e., allergic sensitization, and a potential novel trigger, aeroallergen exposure, and, in the process, to replicate the previously reported gender-specific relationship between allergy and mood disorders, in individuals and families. Confirming that allergens and allergy are related to suicide epidemiologically, in conjunction with clinical research and laboratory work, is expected to improve prediction and prevention of suicide."
1793,HHS,NSF,"Obesity is a major health problem that predisposes to type 2 diabetes and other serious conditions. A morecomplete understanding of how fat synthesis is regulated in adipocytes is critical to guide rationaldevelopment of new approaches for treating obesity and its complications. In the last grant period, wedemonstrated that medium-chain fatty acids (octanoate) stimulate beta-oxidation and inhibit triglyceridesynthesis in adipocytes, mimicking some of the metabolic effects of fasting. Analogous anti-lipogenic effectshave been found in adipocytes treated with TNFalpha. We demonstrated that the three stressors,fasting invivo, octanoate, and TNFalpha in vitro, induce many of the same cellular responses. These includeincreased generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS), activation of MAP-kinases (MARK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased expression of the nuclear transcription factor PPARgammaand associated lipogenic genes. In light of these findings, we plan to use these three stressorsto manipulatelipogenesis in adipocytes to dissect mechanisms of regulation. We hypothesize that critical signals (ROS orROS-independent) are generatedas a result of increased beta-oxidation.These signaling molecules activatestress-responsive kinases, which inactivate PPARgamma,attenuating expression of genes necessary for fatsynthesis. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) to determine whether ROS iscrucial for regulation of lipogenesis; (2) to test if changes in beta-oxidation generate critical signals thatcause inactivation of PPARgamma; and (3) to determine if PPARgamma is the point at which signalsconverge that control stress-induced anti-lipogenic effects, what is the mechanism of PPARgammainactivation, and which metabolic genes are most sensitive to the stress manipulation. Each aim will beaddressed with comprehensive and integratedapplication of cell biology and molecular biology incombination with metabolic and biochemical approaches, using culture murine and human adipocytes aswell as rodent models. Together, these studies will provide new insights into the stress-induced regulation oflipogenesis in adipocytes, a potentially important avenue for modulating energy balance."

1847,HHS,HHS,"The increasing burden of malaria, in part, due to drug resistance in the parasite Plasmodium falciparum,demands new therapies. Recent research in the field of transcription has demonstrated the functionalimportance of chromatin in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. Enzymes that modulate chromatinstructures have a profound effect on controlling gene expression. Among these enzymes, histoneacetyltransferases (HATs), which transfer the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of histones, are the best studied. The antiparasitic effects of drugs that disturb histoneacetylation and recent studies from our group on the chromatin remodeling factors in P.falciparumdemonstrated that dynamic histone acetylation is an important epigenetic mechanism of transcriptionregulation and plays a prominent role in development of the malaria parasite. Thus, we propose to 1)characterize two families of transcription-related HAT proteins, 2) determine their functional roles in globaltranscription regulation, and 3) identify the subunits of multiprotein HAT complexes in P. falciparum. HATproteins will be characterized using molecular and biochemical approaches, and their functions in parasitedevelopment and transcription regulation will be determined by targeted gene disruption and genome-wideexpression analysis. This proposed research aims to reveal the epigenetic mechanisms in transcriptionregulation that controls the parasite development and virulence. The fundamental importance of histoneacetylation in gene regulation and the great potential of HAT and histone deacetylase as drug targetsunderline the significance of research in this area, which may lead to novel antimalarial drugs.Malaria is still a major public health problem in many countries. Its recent resurgence in prevalence ispartially due to drug resistance. This study aims to characterize the functions of a group of enzymes thatregulate parasite gene expression, which may lead to the design of novel antimalarial drugs."

The spectrum of intra-tumoral histological heterogeneity in adenocarcinoma suggestsnvasiveness represents a continuum of disease from noninvasive bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAG) toadenocarcinoma mixed subtype with BAG component to pure invasive adenocarcinoma. The molecularevents essential to this transition in the lung are presently unknown. In this study, we focus on invasion, asignificant biological and morphological characteristic of cancer with direct clinical implications in terms ofmetastasis and outcome. In preliminary gene expression profiling experiments, we identified the type II TGF-/? receptor (TGF/SRII), which was expressed at significantly lower levels in invasive tumors, as one of themost interesting genes in the acquisition of lung invasiveness classifiers. We hypothesize that repression ofTGFBRII in lung adenocarcinoma is required to mediate tumor/stromal interactions that precede theacquisition of invasiveness in lung adenocarcinoma. In this grant proposal, we will address the mainhypothesis in the following Specific aims: 1. Determine the direct role of Tgfbr2 repression onadenocarcinoma invasiveness in vivo using genetic model of murine lung adenocarcinoma. We will create anovel animal model of invasive lung adenocarcinoma in mice with pulmonary targeted deletion of Tgfbr2 andmutation of K-Ras. In Aim 2, we will determine the requirement for CCL5 (Rantes) in mediating tumor-stromal interactions that are important for invasion of TGFBRII knock-down cells. CCL5 was identified as apotential downstream mediator of TGFB signaling in invasive tumors. In Aim 3, we will create a largeadenocarcinoma tumor microarray to examine the clinical significance of TGFBRII immunostaining humanlung adenocarcinoma. In these studies, we will demonstrate the importance of TGFBR2 pathways inmodulating tumor epithelial/stromal interactions important for the acquisition of invasiveness in lungadenocarcinoma and we expect to identify the mechanisms of this activity. The results of these studies willfacilitate the attainment of the long-term goals, which are to develop clinically available assays to predictinvasive propensity in adenocarcinoma tissue specimens and to develop and test pharmacologic agents thatwill reduce invasiveness in patients with lung cancer or prevent the development of invasive tumors inindividuals at high risk for lung cancer."

The uniquely distinguishing feature of NTx-induced autoimmunity is it dependency upon the disruption of neonatal thympoiesis and establishment and maintenance of a peripheral CD4+CD25+ T suppressor cell repertoire required for the prevention of autoimmune disease, importantly, D3Tx does not lead to autoimmune disease in all strains of mice indicating that this process is genetically controlled. In this regard, we have identified linkage of D3Tx-induced AOD and its intermediate phenotypes, anti-ovarian autoantibody responsiveness, oophoritis, and atrophy, to five quantitative trait loci (QTL) designated Aodl-Aod5 and to H2 and Gasa2, a QTL controlling susceptibility to D3Tx-induced AG. The working hypothesis underlying our genetic studies on D3Tx-induced AOD is that one or more of the QTL controlling susceptibility to D3Tx-induced autoimmunity plays a role in the genesis and/or functionality of CD4 +CD25+ suppressor T cells mediating peripheral tolerance to self antigens. Toward this end, we have established, or are in the process of establishing, panels of interval specific bi-directional recombinant congenic lines encompassing each of the AOD QTL. To date, we have shown that Aod1 is comprised of two linked QTL (Aodla and Aod1 b)with opposing allelic effects on susceptibility to autoimmune oophoritis; and that stefin A1 (Stfal) and A2 (Stfa2), inhibitors of cathepsin S, a cysteine protease required for autoantigen presentation and the development of autoimmune disease following D3Tx, are candidates for Aod1b. In this application we will: 1) complete the congenic mapping for each of the AOD QTL at a resolution of 1 cM or less and 2) directly assess the IL2 structural polymorphism as a candidate for a shared autoimmune disease QTL underlying Aod2, Idd3, and eae3."
2031,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objectives are to understand the cellular mechanisms of mechanotransduction in auditory hair cells and the factors underlying the cochlea's tonotopic organization. Experiments will focus on the role of intracellular Ca 2+ in regulating transducer channel adaptation and hair bundle mechanics. Hair cell responses will be measured in the isolated cochleas of both reptiles and mammals and will be combined with intracellular Ca 2+ imaging. Specific aims are: (1) to record transducer currents in rodent hair cells before and after the onset of hearing, documenting the changes in properties with maturation and with cochlear location. (2) to characterize single transducer channels and investigate their modulation by Ca 2+ and variation with frequency. Comparison of turtle and rodent results may illustrate the evolution of transducer channel properties; (3) to measure the mechanical properties of hair cell stereociliary bundles and search for spontaneous and active bundle motion in mammalian outer hair cells. The interaction between active bundle motion and outer hair cell contractility will be used to assess the roles of the two processes in amplification and tuning in the mammalian cochlea. (4) to measure the distribution of K+ channel slice variants in the turtle cochlea from both single channel recording and immunolabeling for specific channel isoforms. The results may provide insight into the origin of the cochlea's tonotopic organization. (5) to measure and alter Ca 2+ concentration in hair bundles and relate it to control of transducer channel activation and active hair bundle motion. The contributions of Ca 2+ buffering and uptake into intracellular compartments, especially the mitochondria, to limit Ca 2+ transients will be studied. Since hair cells experience large Ca 2+ loads, disturbance of Ca 2+ homeostasis may be a leading cause of cell death. Ca 2+ modulation of transducer channels is probably common to all hair cells and may be the conduit of irreversible damage during noise exposure, poisoning with ototoxic agents or aging. Loss of hearing with aging or over-stimulation is often restricted to high frequencies and linked to degeneration of hair cells at the base of the cochlea. The work will address reasons for the differential sensitivity by mapping number and properties of transducer channels with cochlear location."
2034,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is an extension of ongoing program of development of new functional gene discovery methodologies for identification of cancer-related genes. In the previous phase, it was primarily focused on detection of new candidate tumor suppressor and drug sensitivity genes. Recent methodological advancements made it possible now to focus on prospective molecular anticancer treatment targets (ACTTs) defined as cellular factors, the repression of which leads to selective killing or sensitization to treatment of tumor cells. Candidate ACTT search is based on a combination of three powerful techniques - microarray gene expression analysis, genetic suppressor element (GSE) methodology and newly developed selection-subtraction approach (SSA). These techniques are integrated in one technological pipeline that allows identification of genetic events making tumor cells tolerant to oncogenic Ras. The search for ACTTs will start from collection of a pool of candidate sequences representing genes that become upregulated in a series of populations of human fibroblasts rescued from Ras-mediated growth arrest by different cooperating genetic elements identified in the course of preliminary studies. GSE library will be constructed from the selected sequences and screened, using SSA technique, for the GSEs capable of killing Ras-transformed but not normal fibroblasts. Identified genes will be validated as prospective ACTTs by using siRNA constructs against each individual candidate that will be tested for their specific cytotoxicity for tumor cells. Relevance of identified candidate ACTTs to naturally occurring tumor cells will be characterized and the program will be further extended towards development of small molecules with anticancer properties acting by suppression of identified ACTT. The success of the proposed study will indicate development of a powerful target discovery tool that will be applicable for ACTT identification in other types of cancer."
2037,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a regulated disease as the initiation of insulitis and its progression to overt diabetes are neither immediate nor inevitable in genetically susceptible individuals. The focus of this effort is insulitis initiation - what triggers it and what sets its tone.  During the last funding cycle, experiments exploiting the NOD and BDC2.5 mouse models of Type-1 diabetes provided considerable support for the following scenario of events triggering islet infiltration: A physiological ripple of islet beta-cell death produces beta-cell fragments, which are engulfed by resident dendritic cells, provoking them to migrate to the draining pancreatic lymph nodes. En route, they process beta-cell antigens and eventually display them at the cell surface loaded within major histocompatibility molecules. Once in the nodes, the dendritic cells present these antigens to naive T cells circulating through; the T cells are activated and exit to the tissues. In the pancreas, they re-encounter beta-cell-derived antigens, are restimulated and are retained. This scenario will serve as a framework for integrating the molecular and cellular processes associated with insulitis initiation.   During the next funding cycle, the processes responsible for setting the tone of the islet infiltrate will be explored. Preliminary studies comparing BDC2.5/NOD mice (progressively diabetic) and BDC2.5/B6.H-2/g7 mice (immediately diabetic) have spurred the hypothesis that NK cells are important determinants of the aggressivity of the insulitic lesion. The studies proposed herein will address three major questions:  1. Are NK or CD8+ T cells really the culprits? 2. What is the basic mechanism involved - direct killing or release of a mediator? 3. Is the destructive influence NK-cell intrinsic?  Answers to these questions should establish what factors dictate whether insulitis, precedes innocuously or destructively in the BDC2.5 mouse model of autoimmune diabetes Potential human relevance immediately suggests itself: might similar elements play a role in the striking increase in diagnosis of fulminant Type-1 diabetes in children under five years of age?"
2040,HHS,HHS,"The long-term goals of this work are to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of pancreas development during vertebrate embryogenesis. Over the past 2.5 years, we have conducted ascreen.for genes regulating pancreas development using a transgenic zebrafish line expressing GFP in the endoderm and endoderm-derived organs. We have also developed wholemount immunostaining techniques and utilized novel transgenic lines to characterize these mutants. Importantly, we carried out a detailed analysis of wild-type pancreas development in zebrafish (Field et al., 2003b), a study that has facilitated the use of the zebrafish system to identify and/or test genes implicated in this process. Specifically, we found that the zebrafish pancreas is formed by the fusion of two buds, a posterior one that contains only islet cells and an anterior one that gives rise to the exocrine cells and the pancreatic duct. The pancreatic duct in turn gives rise to new islet cells. This initial separation of endocrine and exocrine lineages should facilitate their investigation.We propose to continue our studies with the following specific aims.1) Analyze the pancreas mutants identified and recovered from our screen.2) Further characterize 6 mutants including detailed phenotypic analysis and isolation of the affectedgene.3) Analyze the role of the surrounding tissues in pancreas development and beta cell differentiation. Wewill analyze in detail the emergence of the initial islet cells (those that form the posterior bud) with thegoals of identifying the signals that regulate this process. This information will be useful for designing cellculture protocols to differentiate stem cells into beta cells. We will also test the hypotheses that signalsfrom the lateral plate mesoderm control the development of the anterior pancreatic bud, as well as theemergence of new islet cells from the pancreatic duct.4) Continue to develop reagents and techniques to facilitate the use of the zebrafish as a rapid screeningtool for genes regulating pancreas development and beta cell differentiation."
2044,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to define the role(s) of a novel chemotactic factor and its receptor in leukocyte homing and biology. Extensive preliminary data lead us to hypothesize that this chemoattractant/receptor pair has a significant role in the trafficking of subsets of dendritic cells, key antigen processing and presenting cells that initiate and regulate immune responses in vivo.  The factor has been expressed, purified and shown to attract in vitro differentiated and circulating blood dendritic cell subsets. It circulates in plasma in a proform whose activity is dramatically enhanced by proteolytic events triggered by coagulation; activation can be mediated by the serine protease plasmin, linking the tissue fibrinolytic cascade with a mechanism for dendritic cell recruitment. Additional proteases that can mediate cleavage, and the cleavage site(s) associated with chemotactic activation will be identified. Cell type and tissue expression and regulation of the attractant gene and protein will be determined as well, using quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization to characterize mRNA levels, and generating monoclonal antibodies for immunohistochemistry. Structure/function studies will probe the role of key structural elements. Anti-receptor Mabs and chimeric ligand-Ig have been generated and will be used to study the regulation of cell surface receptors during in vitro differentiation and maturation of monocyte or bone marrow-derived DC; and by dendritic cell and other leukocyte subsets in vivo by flow cytometry. Receptor expression assessed by MAb staining will be correlated with chemotactic responses to the ligand. Finally, the role of this novel chemoattractant/receptor combination in dendritic cell development, trafficking and function will be determined in studies employing inhibitory antibodies to the attractant, and receptor deficient, gene -targeted mice. The effects of these interventions on dendritic cell recruitment, positioning and phenotype in normal and inflamed tissues; on induction and kinetics of immune responses; and on immune pathology in selected models of inflammation, will be determined. The proposed studies promise to define an important regulator of immune responses, and may suggest novel strategies to enhance immunity for vaccination, or to suppress immunity for transplantation, autoimmune and allergic diseases."
2067,HHS,NSF,"We have made major progress in all of the original specific aims of our investigations of the factors thatregulate a murine autoimmune disease during the last grant support period. Our analysis of therelationship between expression of an autoreactive T cell receptor and virally-induced autoimmune diseaseindicated an important role for central tolerance (negative selection). However, the relative impact ofcentral and self-tolerance mechanisms in disease prevention could not be directly assessed. We are nowin a good position to define the relative contributions of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms to thegeneration and maintenance of self-tolerance in the experimental plan that we propose for the next periodof requested grant support. First, we will continue to delineate the molecular basis of aTCR-coupledsignaling pathway that culminates in thymocyte negative selection (SA1) and use this information to test theeffects of defective central tolerance on the development of autoimmune disease (SA2). In SA3, we willestablish the impact of peripheral regulation on self-tolerance, using mice deficient in either regulatory CD4+or CD8+ T cells. These studies will allow a clear separation of the contribution of peripheral T cellregulation from central (deletional) tolerance mechanisms. Our progress over the past grant period hasprovided us with the experimental and conceptual foundations that will allow us to define the relative impactof central and peripheral mechanisms in maintenance of self-tolerance and prevention of autoimmunityafter either viral infection or deliberate exposureto self-antigens in the context of heightened innateimmune responses."
2079,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Notch pathway is a conserved signaling mechanism that functions to modulate cell-fate decisions. The overall objectives of this proposal are to define roles for Notch in cell-fate determination during vascular development, physiological angiogenesis and maintenance of vasculature. Our general hypothesis is that Notch is critical for arterial-venous, venous-lymphatic development and for physiological angiogenesis. Our general strategy will use a combination of in vitro angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis assays and mouse modeling to define the consequences of altering Notch activity in endothelial cells. Our preliminary studies using in vitro assays suggest that Notch promotes sprouting and survival of blood endothelial cells but blocks capillary-like cord formation. In Aim I, using in vitro angiogenesis assays, we evaluate signaling mechanisms that function downstream of Notch, with a focus on the PI-3K/Akt and VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 pathways. In Aim II, we evaluate the VEGFR-3 gene as a direct transcriptional target of Notch and explore a role for Notch in lymphangiogenesis by manipulating cultured lymphatic endothelial cells. In Aim III, we use mouse models that activate or inactivate Notch in embryonic vasculature to examine Notch function. We have developed mouse models that conditionally activate Notch signaling in the vasculature to define Notch action at various stages of embryogenesis. Notch activation in embryonic vasculature will be used to evaluate roles for Notch in arterial/venous and venous/lymphatic specification, recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells, vascular remodeling, and heart development. Notch genes are expressed in adult vasculature but their postnatal function is unknown. In Aim IV, Notch will be conditionally activated in adult vasculature to evaluate function in vascular integrity. In vivo assays will examine whether Notch contributes to, or interferes, with VEGF- or FGF-induced angiogenesis. Finally, Notch function will be studied in the ovary, which has robust physiological angiogenesis during folliculogenesis and corpus luteum formation. Using a hypophysectomized mouse model that allows hormonal induction of ovarian angiogenesis, we will probe Notch function in ovarian vasculature. These mice will be used to define the consequences to ovarian angiogensis when Notch is conditionally activated in ovarian vessels or interfered with using Notch antagonists. Our long-term objective is to understand Notch function in human vascular disorders and during pathological angiogenesis."
2097,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas' disease is caused by the protozoan parasite T. cruzi and is now recognized as an emerging HIV/AIDS-related, opportunistic infection. Subsequent to immunosuppression there is reactivation of dormant organisms leading to myocarditis and necrotizing encephalitis. Since HIV-infected patients receiving HAART live for many years there is the likelihood that there will be repeated episodes of reactivation as their immune status waxes and wanes. Hence, progressive myocarditis and cardiovascular remodeling and chronic cardiomyopathy will likely develop in a more rapid fashion. In this application we have defined ventricular remodeling as changes in structure and function following myocardial damage together with characteristic molecular changes. These changes are the result of inflammation and/or necrosis. T. cruzi infection of the myocardium results in a dilated cardiomyopathy. Our overall objective is to examine some of the important signaling pathways involved in cardiac remodeling as a consequence of the T. cruzi infection. We plan to examine the consequences of T. cruzi-infection on cyclins in vitro, Our investigations clearly indicate that T. cruzi-induced ERK activation modulates the expression and/or activity of cyclins, which function as mediators of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Cyclins are responsible for remodeling in the cardiovascular system. Therefore, the kinetics of the expression of cyclins in infected cultured cells and co-culture systems. Since we have demonstrated that T. cruzi induces expression of cyclin D1, we will determine the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of cyclin D 1 promoter activation in cardiac fibroblasts employing transient transfection/promoter assays. We plan to determine the consequence of T. cruzi infection on cyclins in mouse models of chagasic heart disease on. During acute T. cruzi infection there is activation of ERK, transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kB and increased expression of cyclin D 1 in the myocardium. Therefore, in the mouse model of Chagas' disease the kinetics of expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in the cells of the myocardium of T. cruzi-infected mice will be determined and correlated with progression of cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms underlying the alterations in these proteins in the myocardium will be investigated by a variety of techniques including immune complex assays and cell proliferation experiments. The contribution of cyclin D 1 in cardiovascular remodeling will be investigated utilizing mouse models including cyclin D1 null mice and mice in which NF-r.d3 and ET-1 have been selectively deleted from cardiac myocytes. These studies will lead to a better understanding of cardiac remodeling in chagasic cardiomyopathy, an emerging opportunistic infection in AIDS. In addition, it will provide potential targets of adjunctive therapy."
2103,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autoreactive B cells are censored by multiple mechanisms of tolerance induction, including clonal deletion, anergy (non-responsiveness) or antigen receptor editing. It is generally believed that these processes are imposed to bone marrow (BM) immature and peripheral transitional B-cells through coordinated signaling of B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptors. However, the intracellular signaling machinery that controls these processes has not been fully characterized. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which the Cbl family of E3-ubiquitin ligases regulates B-cell tolerance. This research goal roots in the following findings: 1) Cbl proteins negatively regulate BCR signaling through inhibiting tyrosine kinase cascades. 2) Inactivation of both c-Cbl and Cbl-b in B cells alters development of transitional B-cells. 3) B-cell specific c-Cbl and Cbl-b double knock-out (dKO) mice develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like disease. These results together demonstrate a critical regulatory role of Cbl proteins in B-cell tolerance induction. We propose that Cbl proteins regulate B-cell tolerance by facilitating clonal deletion, anergy, and/or BCR editing; they may do so through promoting ubiquitination of key signaling components that control the development and survival of transitional B-cells that are susceptible to tolerance induction. We will study: 1) Whether Cbl proteins control B-cell tolerance through clonal deletion, anergy or BCR editing. 2) Whether Cbl proteins regulate B-cell tolerance at developmental checkpoints of transitional B-cells. 3) Whether Cbl-mediated ubiquitination controls BCR-proximal signaling and transitional B-cell development. Completion of this work will bring insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Cbl proteins control B-cell tolerance and autoimmune diseases. It might also provide tool for clinic therapy."
2106,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular controls governing commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to specific lineages have still not been fully elucidated. The importance of understanding such controls is underscored by the fact that a block in differentiation is a hallmark of acute leukemias. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), involving the precursors of myeloid cells (granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages), accounts for over 90 percent of acute leukemias in adults. In this application, I propose to continue our study of the molecular basis of differentiation of myeloid cells, employing a detailed analysis of the transcription factor PU.1, which regulates nearly every myeloid gene, and is absolutely required for normal myeloid development. PU.1 is expressed in stem cells and upregulated early during myeloid and lymphoid commitment. The importance of understanding how PU.1 is regulated is underscored by studies indicating that altered expression of PU. 1 can induce changes in hematopoietic lineage development, and in some experimental cases misexpression leads to leukemia. Thus, the overall goal of this continuation proposal is to continue our studies of how PU.1 is regulated, and what its function is in adult hematopoiesis. These studies will further our understanding of (1) commitment of normal hematopoietic precursors to the myeloid lineage; and (2) the block in normal myeloid maturation from blasts to mature myeloid cells in AML. Therefore, the Specific Aims are: (1)To determine how PU.1 expression is regulated in hematopoietic cells, using transgenic and knockout studies; (2) To determine the role of PU.1 in adult hematopoiesis by studying a conditional knockout model; and (3) To determine whether different levels of PU. 1 expression play a role in directing hematopoietic lineage determination and development."
2121,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In response to injury, an evolutionarily conserved wound healing process occurs. This response, if gone awry, can result in a pathologic process known as fibrosis, which is due to abnormal accumulation of extra cellular matrix (ECM) and is responsible for causing structural alterations and loss of function of the involved organ. Hepatic fibrosis, if not checked, can progress into cirrhosis and cause irreversible damage to the liver. The main component of the ECM is type I collagen, which, in the case of hepatic fibrosis, is synthesized by the activated stellate cells of the liver. Upon activation, stellate cells become more active in that they are proliferative, contractile due to a -smooth muscle actin and synthesize increased amounts of type I collagen. In our laboratory we have developed a triplex-forming oligodeoxyribonueleotide (TFO), which forms a triple helix structure with the C1 region (-170 to -141) of the a1(I) collagen gene promoter and inhibits transcription. Further we have shown that this TFO inhibits liver fibrosis, induced by administration of the chemical, dimethyl-nitorosamine (DMN), in rats. Now we would like to develop this antigene TFO as a potential antifibrotic agent. We hypothesize that this TFO selectively inhibits collagen synthesis in activated stellate cells. In this proposal, we describe experiments to address the mechanism by which the TFO inhibits collagen gene transcription. Whether the TFO blocks transcription by forming triplexes or by blocking events that lead to inflammation and activation of stellate cells will be studied. Experiments to develop a most efficacious TFO and to study its toxicity, stability, and biodistribution have been proposed. Further, the uptake by different tissues in rats and by different cell types, such as hepatocytes, stellate and Kupffer cells of the liver will also be studied. In these studies we will be using histochemical methods to monitor fibrosis, immunohistochemical methods to examine toxicity and inflammation and various biochemical and nucleic acid hybridization techniques to quantitate the levels of collagen mRNA in the liver tissues. In addition, we will assay for liver function to assess the extent of damage to the liver by the DMN and prevention by the TFO. The data generated from this project may lead to Phase I trials in humans for the treatment of liver fibrosis."
2150,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modification of the carbohydrate content of hFSH has significant effect on the physiologic properties of the hormone in vivo. To date, preliminary characterization of one such modification has been investigated: hFSH tethered to the CTP from the beta-subunit of hCG (either as a single-chain peptide or as a dimer associated with alpha-subunit). This modification increases the half-life and in vivo bioactivity of the hormone. The effect of fewer or greater numbers of O-linked carbohydrates, the impact on spacing of these moieties, and the potential role of N-linked sugars in this capacity have yet to be thoroughly investigated. These studies will generate important data as to general principles for carbohydrate physiology. By defining the role of differential glycosylation, therapeutic derivatives may be developed through carbohydrate manipulations that may be applicable to all the glycoprotein hormones as well as recombinant proteins in general. In addition, we have preliminary data indicating the feasibility of producing bifunctional hFSH analogues consisting of hFSH tethered to a growth factor. Bifunctionality, both in vitro and in vivo at the level of the ovary was confirmed. This allows for continued and expanded studies on the role of various targeted growth factors on ovarian physiology. Synergistic action on follicular development may also have therapeutic implications for women requiring ovarian stimulation for infertility. Structural knowledge of the interface between FSH and its receptor is essential to developing methods to perturb receptor activity. We plan to determine the structure of the extracellular domain (ECD) of the hFSH receptor, a member of the G protein- coupled receptor superfamily. A three-dimensional representation of the binding region of a glycoprotein hormone receptor will be elucidated for the first time. The structural dynamics and conformational changes in the receptor following ligand binding will provide data crucial to our understanding of the conditions requisite for receptor activation. Together, the studies described in this application will greatly enhance our understanding of gonadotropin biology, the role of various cofactors in ovarian physiology and elicit new methods for altering pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of recombinant proteins."
2157,HHS,HHS,"Maintenance of lymphoid homeostasis is critical to avert diseases such as autoimmunity, lymphoma, andimmunodeficiency. We propose to study a novel mechanism of T cell homeostasis¿control of nutrientusage, or trophic level, by regulation of glucose uptake and the glucose transporter, Glutl. Lymphocytesrequire dynamic regulation of glucose uptake to allow both cell survival in a resting state and robust growthand proliferation in immune responses. We have shown that glucose uptake and metabolism are regulatedevents that can have a profound impact on T cell survival and function. We show that glucose uptake in bothresting and activated T cells is tightly regulated in vitro by the cytokines interleukin 7 (IL7) and interleukin 2(IL2), respectively. The in vivo signals and signaling mechanisms required for regulation of Glutl and theeffects of altered glucose uptake on T cell size, survival, and function, however, remain uncertain. In thisapplication, we propose to address these issues to bridge the fields of immunology and cellular metabolism.We will: (1) Determine the in vivo role of IL7 in regulation of Glutl expression and intracellular trafficking byadoptive transfer of T cells into IL7-/- hosts and conditional deletion of IL7R in mature T cells. (2) Identifysignaling mechanisms that regulate Glutl expression and cell surface localization. The PI3K/Akt andJak/STAT signaling pathways are activated by IL7 and IL2 and these pathways will be analyzed for their rolein Glutl regulation in cell line and primary T cell models using RNAi, transgenic, and knockout approaches.(3) Examine the role of Glutl expression in T cell development and homeostasis using a T cell specific Glutltransgenic mouse model and in vitro RNAi of Glutl. The ability of Glutl expression to modulate lymphomaand autoimmunity observed in Akt transgenic mice will be investigated to determine how altered glucoseuptake may affect disease. Together, these experiments will identify signals and signaling mechanisms thatregulate T cell glucose uptake and determine the role of glucose uptake in T cell survival, activation, anddiseases of the immune system."
2208,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) from latency results in significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised solid organ and bone marrow recipients. Despite the ongoing development of effective antiviral agents, and the advent of preemptive therapy, drug-related toxicity and viral gene mutations leading to resistant virus present new clinical challenges, highlighting the need for alternative therapies, potentially aimed at early events in the process of reactivation. This project will focus on the molecular mechanisms of reactivation of CMV from latency, emphasizing the requirement for early triggers of Immediate Early (IE) gene expression, a necessary first step in the viral lytic cycle. The first aim will continue our current investigations into the requirement for TNF signal transduction and downstream activation of NFkB in both HCMV and MCMV IE gene expression in allogeneic grafts transplanted into immunocompetent hosts and investigate other factors likely to contribute to induction of IE gene expression, in an attempt to expand our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying CMV IE gene expression in vivo. The second aim will be to assemble a molecular definition of the events leading to reactivation of infectious virus from latency in vitro, by characterizing and investigating the molecular requirements for reactivation inferred from the in vivo model. In the third aim, we will test the requirement for the same mechanisms in the production of infectious virus in reactivation from latency in selectively immunocompromised hosts, in an effort to examine the role of the allogeneic immune response in host control of CMV reactivation to infectious virus, to test the hypothesis that TNF induced NFkB activation produced by allogeneic transplantation is required for reactivation of infectious virus in an immunocompromised allograft recipient. In the aggregate, the proposed studies form a logical extension of studies performed in the current grant period and will provide a comprehensive paradigm of central importance to the immunocompromised recipient of an atlograft. A better understanding of the viral and cellular factors responsible for the initial events required for CMV reactivation from latency to productive infection is essential to the development of novel strategies in the prevention of CMV infection and disease."
2224,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) affect more than 1 million Americans, predisposing them to a lifetime risk of hemorrhagic stroke and epilepsy. Immunoglobulin and other related genes are markedly upregulated within human CCM lesions. Preliminary work suggests the infiltration of B lymphocytes and plasma cells within the lesions. A potential role of the immune response in this disease has not been postulated previously, but would be compelling, given the unique antigenic milieu of CCM lesions with sequestered thrombi and leaky blood-brain barrier, and the numerous examples of immune modulation of angiogenesis in other disease states. It could explain, in part, why some CCM lesions remain biologically dormant, while others proliferate with serious clinical consequences. This pilot proposal will characterize cellular and humoral components of the immune response in CCMs and initiate investigation into its clonality. The hypotheses to be tested are that CCM lesions are associated with immunoglobulin-producing B cells and plasma cells and that the immune response in CCMs is oligoclonal. Specific Aim 1 proposes to characterize the predominant immunoglobulin isotype and distribution of inflammatory cells in CCM lesions, including lesions with and without recent aggressive clinical behavior. Specific Aim 2 proposes to determine whether the immunoglobulins in CCMs are oligoclonal, as in response to specific antigenic trigger. Oligoclonality shall be assessed by isoelectric focusing of the predominant immunoglobulin isotypes isolated from the lesion, in comparison to the patient's serum, and by the distribution of lengths of complementary- determining regions 3 (CDR3) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in mRNA isolated from lesions and from pooled plasma cells and B cells laser captured from CCMs, in comparison to peripheral lymphocytes from the blood of the same patients. LAY STATEMENT ON PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Immune response could play a role in or represent a potential marker of cerebral cavernous malformation lesion proliferation and hemorrhage. The proposed pilot studies will generate preliminary data for future research aimed at comparing the immune response in quiescent versus clinically aggressive CCM lesions. An oligoclonal immune response shown in this pilot study would stimulate future research to identify autoimmune or extrinsic antigenic triggers involved in CCM disease."

Of particular interest is therole of Cdk5 in dopamine signaling, the main target of drugs of abuse. Using Cre/loxP technology, aconditional cdk5 knockout mouse has been generated to allow temporal control of tissue-specific knockout ofCdk5.

2275,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cadmium (Cd(ll)) is a common, highly toxic environmental contaminant and a component of cigarette smoke. While the cellular effects of Cd(ll), DNA damage and oxidative stress, are well established, their origins remain unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain Cd(ll) toxicity. Cd(ll) may generally displace Zn(ll) and Fe(ll) from metalloproteins, with these liberated metal ions resulting in the observed damage. Alternately, Cd(ll) may bind and inhibit specific proteins involved in the cellular responses to DNA damage and oxidative stress. The goal of this project is to examine these hypotheses and further our understanding of Cd(ll) toxicity. High-throughput techniques for isolating proteins and determining their in vivo Cd(ll) binding will be used to examine Cd(ll) binding by target proteins in vivo. The in vitro Cd(ll) binding and metal specificity of such proteins will be evaluated to provide a biochemical understanding of how Cd(ll) targets specific proteins. Finally, we will employ X-ray absorbtion microbe techniques to examine the effects of Cd(ll) on the cellular distribution of biologically important metals. Together this approach will provide detailed biochemical information regarding the cellular origins of Cd(ll) toxicity."
2302,HHS,NSF,"Ethanol abuse and alcoholism remain very serious societal problems. A significant problem is the inability todiagnose alcohol abuse either in the general population or within selected groups of individuals such asadolescents and the recovering alcoholic. Accordingly, this proposal seeks to develop diagnostic biomarkersignatures of acute and chronic alcohol consumption for diagnosing high-risk drinking, detecting relapse todrinking, disclosing recent drinking and in high risk situations such as pregnancy. To this end, studies areproposed to examine serum proteins and protein patterns for potential signatures in a powerful non-humanprimate model that is not encumbered by problems of comorbid drug use, inadequate diet and unreliableassessments of drinking history. In these NIAAA-funded, ongoing, within-subject studies, monkeys havebeen induced to voluntarily drink large amounts of alcohol. In the course of the studies (encompassing over100 individual animals covering years of behavior and observation), serum samples have routinely beencollected and archived. Experiments are proposed to screen these samples for potential biomarkers that canthen be taken forward into the human population. Serum samples from a long-standing nonhuman primateself-administration study will be used as a training set for biomarker identification using high throughputproteomics. Samples will be processedto deplete the most abundant, obscuring proteins and then subjectedto 2-DIGE (2-D Fluorescence Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis) for quantitative fluorescence identification ofaltered serum protein expression followed by MALDI-ToF/ToF identification of protein species. Statisticalvalidation will be conducted, in a blinded fashion, using a test set of samples from an independent colony ofself-administering monkeys, which will also contain data on adolescent vulnerability. The key criteria of anyputative biomarkers will be sensitivity (percentage of positive scores among drinkers) and specificity(percentage of false positives in a non-drinking population). In addition, these studies will provide initialindices of positive and negative predictive values for biomarker signatures. A clinical test for ethanol abuse and alcoholism would have many potential uses. To discover proteinbiomarkers of ethanol abuse and alcoholism, serum from a controlled non-human primate population self-administering ethanol will be examined by quantitative proteomic methods."
2305,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Cardiovascular disease is the nation's leading cause of death, claiming a life every 33 seconds, 2600 lives each day, and nearly one million lives each year. For the majority of patients with any type of significantly advanced heart failure, the common, final clinical scenario is of a severely limited quality of life associated with a significant risk of death. The hypothesis behind the proposed projects is that stem cell therapy will benefit patients with varying degrees of heart failure. To date, the cummulative data from our studies and several others demonstrate that stem cell injections appear to be safe and possibly effective in at least some patients with heart failure. Our research consortium has conducted many studies (both pre-clinical and clinical) in this area of research and is currently enrolling patients in an FDA-approved Phase I clinical trial of transendocardial injections of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells for treatment of patients with advanced heart failure. In this application, we propose 2 potential protocols for the network. Protocol 1 allows us to continue our present trial with a Phase II trial that will also address an important question that remains unanswered: What is the ideal number of cells for transplant? (i.e.: Would 100,000,000 cells be more beneficial than the 30,000,000 we are currently using?) Protocol 2 focuses on the immediate postinfarct period and uses a specific type of stem cell, the Stro bright or mesenchymal precursor cell (MPC). All cells will be injected transendocardially and guided by electromechanical mapping into areas of viable myocardium. Safety of the cell delivery process will be assessed periprocedurely with Holter monitoring, and long-term safety will be assessed clinically for at least 3 years with imaging studies and catheter evaluations. Efficacy will be assessed primarily on the basis of imaging studies (echo, angio, MRI, SPECT, X-ray) and EKG, 24hr Holter monitoring, treadmill with MVO2, and lab work. We have now completed two pre-clinical studies using mesenchymal cell injections in canine models of chronic ischemia and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Both studies demonstrated that mesenchymal cells injected by the transendocardial route differentiated into smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, and resulted in increased vascularity and improved cardiac function. If proven safe and effective in FDA-approved clinical trials, these new therapies could extend the lives and improve the quality of life for almost 1 million people each year in the U.S. alone.

2332,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background. Inherited mutations of the breast cancer susceptibility gene-1 (BRCA1) confer a high risk for specific tumor types, including breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 plays roles in the regulation of DNA repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and gene transcription. But these generic actions do not explain why BRCA1 mutations lead to specific tumor types, such as breast cancer. We have been studying a mammary tissue-specific action of BRCA1 [ie., its ability to repress estrogen receptor (ER-alpha signaling) that may, in part, explain why BRCA1 mutations are associated with estrogen (E2)-dependent tumor types (eg., breast, endometrial, and cervical cancers).   Preliminary Studies. During the initial funding period, we have completed and gone beyond the original proposed objectives in understanding the mechanisms by which the BRCA1 regulates estrogen action. In new preliminary studies, we mapped the interacting sites between the BRCA1 and ER-alpha proteins at a high resolution. And we adduced evidence for two distinct mechanisms by which the ER-alpha regulatory function of BRCA1 can be inactivated: 1) through oncogenic signaling pathways (eg., over-expression of cyclin D1, c-Myc, and the c-Akt kinase); and 2) via a tumor-associated mutation of an acetylation site within the hinge region of ER-alpha. Finally, we generated preliminary evidence that exogenous E2 induces mammary hyperplasia and preneoplasia in Brca1-deficient mice.   Hypothesis. BRCA1 prevents breast cancer, in part, by inhibition of ER-alpha activity and, in part, by estrogen (E2)-independent actions (ie., by its function as a  caretaker  gene, to prevent genomic instability). The E2-dependent and E2-independent functions of BRCA1 are distinct and can be structurally dissociated. Finally, the ability of BRCA1 to repress ER-alpha can be functionally inactivated by oncoproteins and growth factor signaling pathways.   Research Aims. The major goals of this project are: SA1. To precisely identify the molecular determinants of the BRCA1:ER-alpha interaction; SA2. To determine the mechanisms by which oncogene signaling rescues BRCA1 inhibition of ER-alpha. SA3. To determine the role of acetylation in regulating ER-alpha resistance to inhibition by BRCA1; and SA4. To examine the interaction between estrogen and Brca1 in mammary tumorigenesis in vivo.   Significance. These studies address a major mechanism by which BRCA1 inactivation leads to breast cancer: namely, deregulation of ER-alpha signaling. They are relevant to the pathogenesis of both hereditary and sporadic breast cancers. Thus, sporadic breast cancers frequently exhibit absent or reduced expression of BRCA1; and we found that knockdown of endogenous BRCA1 by RNA interference causes ligand-independent activation of ER-alpha. In addition to their implications for breast cancer pathogenesis, these studies are of practical importance, since they may suggest novel approaches for breast cancer prevention and treatment."
2335,HHS,HHS,"Polyketide synthases (PKSs) use a multi-step process to generate structurally complex natural productswith wide ranging pharmaceutical and agricultural applications. Over the past decade there has beensignificant interest and notable successes in the generation of hybrid PKSs. These metabolic systems areattractive due to their potential to generate new natural products with valuable applications including drugdiscovery and development. Nonetheless, a significant and unresolved problem in this endeavor has beenthe significant finding that hybrid modular PKS systems are either catalytically inefficient, or simply inactive. The ongoing discovery of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters has recently provided new sets ofgenetic tools for the generation of more efficient hybrid PKSs. Recent advances in methods for geneticmanipulation of large biosynthetic gene clusters now permit rapid generation of libraries of hybrid systems,and bioactivity assays can be used to identify those with significant catalytic activity. We have alsodeveloped a new chemoenzymatic approach for generating novel polyketide structures that can utilize bothnative and hybrid PKSs. This project will capitalize on these recent advances and demonstrate how they canbe applied and combined to generate new biologically active macrolide antibiotics. The work will be basedon the pikromycin PKS (Pik PKS)that generates a ketolide macrolactone core molecule (a class ofantibiotics useful for treatment of multidrug resistant pathogens). The four specific aims are as follows: 1) chemoenzymatic synthesis of new macrolide products; 2)relaxing the specificity, and evolving iterative properties of ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase domains; 3)developing new methods for efficient initiation utilizing different substrates; and 4) efficiently and selectivelyaltering extender unit specificity. Overall this project will provide new techniques and genetic tools that canbe applied to other PKSs systems, including catalytically impaired hybrid PKSs, and will represent animportant step towards the ultimate goal of using of combinatorial biosynthesis and chemoenzymaticsynthesis for practical drug development."
2383,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Considerable recent progress in anatomical, neuropsychological, and neurophysiological studies on humans and animals have confirmed the importance of the hippocampal system in memory, and many of these studies have suggested that distinct components of this system may make different contributions. However, this view is controversial and the precise nature of the contributions of cortical areas surrounding the hippocampus (the parahippocampal region) and the hippocampus itself are not well understood. In the proposed work, we will take advantage of recently developed animal models of hippocampal memory function and employ state-of-the-art multi-channel recording and population analysis methods. Using these methods we will characterize neural representations in subregions of the hippocampus and surrounding cortical areas of animals performing episodic recognition, pattern separation, and pattern completion operations for which performance depends on hippocampal function. We will investigate the hypothesis that the hippocampus rapidly encodes stimuli in the context in which they are experienced whereas separate areas within the surrounding parahippocampal region encode individual stimuli and contextual cues. Furthermore, we will explore the nature of interactions between the hippocampus and cortex, testing the hypothesis that the hippocampus supports the cued recovery of contextual representations within the cortex. These characterizations of individual and combined network processing in the hippocampus and surrounding cortex will improve our understanding of the normal functions of this system as well as its breakdown in memory disorders."
2390,HHS,NSF,"In spite of progress against prostate cancer (PC), treatment of the disease still exacts significantfinancial and quality-of-life costs. And, as treatment is not always effective, PC still kills some 30,000American men each year. Prevention, including chemoprevention, remains a potentially attractiveapproach.Among the numerous chemopreventive agents, selenium appears promising; its chemopreventive utilitywas strongly suggested by the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial, led for several years by thePI. In the NPC trial, men assigned to supplementation by 200 meg selenium/day experienced 50%lower PC mortality than men assigned to placebo; these results helped to lead to the trials of seleniumfor men with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and to the Selenium and Vitamin EChemoprevention Trial (SELECT).The mechanisms underlying the chemopreventive action of selenium in PC are poorly understood.Results from our laboratory indicate that selenium alters androgen signaling, with decreased expressionof the androgen receptor (AR), and AR target genes such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), kallikrein2 (KLK2), 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), cell division cycle 6 (CDC6), and hepatocytenuclear factor 3a (HNF3a). These findings need to be tested in human populations; we propose to dothis by randomizing prostate cancer patients scheduled for brachythrapy and prostatectomy topretreatment supplementation by daily dose of 400 meg selenomethionine, or to placebo. After 8-9weeks of supplementation, at treatment, biopsy core samples will be obtained from the peripheral zoneof the prostate and frozen, then microdissected, with benign tissue analyzed by qRT-PCR forexpression of AR as the primary endpoint, and for PSA, KLK2, DHCR24, CDC6 and HNFSa assecondary endpoints. In addition, we will explore the hypothesis that the activity of thiolmethyltransferase, a key enzyme in selenium metabolism, correlates with the response toselenomethionine supplementation.This study will provide key in vivo, human data on the mechanisms of selenium's action in the prostate,and greatly help interpret the results of the important chemoprevention trials such as HGPIN andSELECT."
2398,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to develop a chemo genomic analysis methodology for reconstructing signaling and transcription networks in bacteria. In particular, Escherichia coli responses to reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS), such as nitric oxide and S-nitrosothiols, will be used as a model system. Instead of relying solely on association relationships, which does not reveal chemical details of signaling mechanisms, the proposed research will develop a paradigm to incorporate chemical reactivity information in the transcriptomic analysis of E. coli. The resulting network will be mechanistically feasible and consistent with gene expression data. The proposed approach consists of iteration through three components: transcriptome measurements, Network Component Analysis (NCA), and chemoinfomatic analysis. The investigation starts from micro array experiments of wild-type E. coli response to RNOS and the initial transcription factor (TF)-promoter connectivity from the literature database, which is incomplete for the conditions of interest. NCA first deduces the activities of TF upon RNOS challenge based on wild-type micro array data. The activities of TFs, rather than the expression levels, provide critical information for deducing chemical mechanisms and signaling pathways. Among the TFs perturbed, chemoinfomatic analysis allows the classification of affected TFs into direct and indirect targets and the identification of potential chemical mechanisms for signaling. The perturbed TFs are then deleted using chromosomal knockout techniques. The resulting knockout strains are further tested for responses to RNOS and the transcriptome data are analyzed in NCA to deduce revised target TFs and transcription networks. If hew TF targets are predicted, then the iteration continues. Otherwise, the predicted networks are verified using genetic and biochemical experiments."
2427,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spoken word recognition is at the root of language comprehension and acquisition. For adults, recognition of known words (numbering in the tens of thousands) is fast, accurate, robust, and effortless. Yet the perceptual computations required are highly complex, as anyone listening to speakers conversing in an unfamiliar language begins to discern: what one hears is a babble lacking readily identifiable words. Nevertheless, within the first year of life, infants must develop the skills needed for spoken word recognition. Such skills are prerequisite to further acquisition of language, for if a language learner cannot break input utterances into their constituent words, it will be impossible to learn how these words fit together or what individual words mean. Studies proposed in this application address acquisition of the three chief components of spoken word recognition: segmentation of continuous speech into word-like chunks, representation of speech in a compact fashion that maximizes efficiency of processing, and identification of tokens as exemplars of particular lexical types. Issues considered include: How does developing lexical knowledge affect segmentation? How are knowledge-driven and signal-driven segmentation related? What are the constraints on properties of speech that infants initially entertain as contributing to lexical representations? The range of such properties narrows with development: what are the statistical properties of input that underlie this change and guide the emergence of native-language phonological categories? Adult word recognition is affected by number and frequency of competitors. How are competitive neighborhoods structured in the developing lexicon? How do processing deadlines and perceptual characteristics of speech tokens interact in word identification? The proposed research will employ a variety of empirical methods to provide converging measures of the development of spoken word recognition in infants from 6 to 18 months: headturn preference, conditioned head-turning, habituation, and intermodal preferential looking. Results from experimental studies with infants will be integrated with computational modeling to assess the feasibility of continuity theories of word recognition development, according to which fundamental processing architecture is shared by infants and adults."
2434,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Accurate characterization of prostate cancer remains a major problem in the clinical management of individual prostate cancer patients and in monitoring clinical trials of emerging therapies. High Resolution - Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) spectroscopy is a non-destructive ex vivo technique that can provide a full chemical analysis of intact prostate tissues prior to a complete histopathologic, immunohistochemical and genetic analysis of the exact same tissue. In this project we will use the high specificity of combined in vivo MRI/MRSI for identifying prostate cancer to target prostate biopsy and surgical tissues in 250 patients prior to therapy and 125 patients demonstrating biochemical failure (rising PSA) and MRI/MRSI evidence of recurrent disease after hormone deprivation therapy for subsequent ex-vivo analyses. The goal of this proposal is to establish a database correlating metabolic profiles associated with specific prostate tissue types, grades of prostate cancer, and response to hormone deprivation therapy and to begin correlating pre-therapy metabolic profiles with gene expression profiles. Using this correlative data we wish to test the following hypotheses: (1) That distinctive metabolic profiles can be associated with the following pathologic prostate tissue types predominatly glandular and stromal healthy peripheral zone tissues, predominatly glandular and stromal benign prostatic hyperplasia, cancers of increasing Gleason score, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), prostatic inflammatory atrophy (PIA) and prostatitis. (2) The dramatic decreases in prostate citrate levels with prostate cancer evolution, progression, and in response to hormone deprivation therapy are associated with changes in morphology (reduction in glandular tissue), prostatic Zn concentration, and/or expression of key Kreb cycle enzymes. (3) Elevated concentrations of phospholipid metabolites (glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine and choline) in prostate cancer prior to and after therapy are associated with changes in morphology (increased malignant epithelial cell density) and/or changes in cellular proliferation and apoptosis. (4) The dramatic decrease in prostatic spermine concentration with prostate cancer evolution, progression and in response to hormone deprivation therapy is associated with changes in its secretion (reduction in glandular tissue), and/or changes in cellular proliferation and apoptosis. (5) That distinctive metabolic profiles can be associated with the over- and/or under-expression of specific genes categorized by the following pathologic criteria, predominatly stromal versus predominatly glandular healthy tissue, healthy tissue versus prostate cancer, and cancer having Gleason Score equal to or less than 6 versus cancer having a Gleason Score equal to or greater than 7. This work should result in improved interpretation of patient MRSI data, and provide data on how HR-MAS metabolic profiles can compliment the pathologic and genetic assessment of prostate cancer prior to and after hormone deprivation therapy."
2445,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is generally accepted that TGFbeta is both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter. While loss or attenuation of TGFbet signal transduction is permissive for transformation, introduction of dominant negative TGFbeta receptors into metastatic cancer cells has been shown to inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), motility, invasiveness, survival, and metastases. In addition, there is evidence that excess production and/or activation of TGFbeta by cancer cells can contribute to tumor progression by paracrine mechanisms involving neo-angiogenesis, production of stroma and proteases, and subversion of immune surveillance mechanisms in tumor hosts. These data provide a rationale in favor of blockade of autocrine/paracrine TGFbeta signaling in human tumors with a therapeutic intent. Several treatment approaches are currently in early clinical   development and have been the focus of our laboratory during the last funding period. Many questions remain about the viability of an anti- TGFbeta treatment strategy, the best molecular approach for inhibition of TGFbeta function in vivo, the biochemical surrogate markers of tumor response, the molecular profiles in tumors for selection into clinical trials, potential toxicities, to mention a few. Therefore, in order to address these issues, we propose the following research aims in this competing renewal: Specific Aim 1: To determine if conditional deletion of TbetaRII in mammary cancer cells in vitro and in vivo inhibits autocrine TGFbeta signaling and tumor progression. Specific Aim 2: To determine whether therapeutic inhibitors of TGFbeta abrogate TGFbeta signaling and induce an antitumor effect both in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether TGFbeta transactivates erbB receptors and elucidate if this   transactivation involves cleavage of erbB receptor trans-membrane ligands. Specific Aim 4: To determine if the activated type I TGFbeta receptor (Alk5) synergizes with HER2 (erbB2) in mammary tumorigenesis and whether it negates the therapeutic effect of HER2 inhibitors in vivo."
2453,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exist as rare populations within blood-forming tissues that both self-renew and generate all blood cell lineages for the life of the host. HSCs have been isolated to relative purity in humans and mice, leading to a general understanding of their cellular and functional properties. Relatively little is known, however, of the genetic program underlying the embryonic development and subsequent maintenance of HSC fate. The development of zebrafish as a model system has introduced unbiased genetic approaches, such as forward genetic screens and high-throughput expression screens, to the study of vertebrate blood formation. Recent transgenesis technology combined with the external fertilization and transparency of zebrafish embryos allows early events in HSC specification, maintenance, and differentiation to be easily observed. In this proposal, these advantages will be utilized to fate map the earliest embryonic blood-forming cells. This will address many long-standing questions in the development of the immune system, including whether mesodermat derivatives give rise to blood precursors through hemangioblastic intermediates, and whether primitive and definitive HSCs share common ancestry. In addition, the tools will be developed to prospectively isolate both embryonic and adult HSC populations. Following the generation of cDNA libraries from each subset, high-throughput expression screens will be performed to identify novel gene functions in vertebrate stem cells. The overall goal of this K01 application is to establish a cell biological context in which to study the genetics of HSCs in zebrafish. Novel genes that function within HSCs and their progeny can subsequently be examined for similar roles in mammalian systems. This award will provide the candidate a period of mentored research in  the field of zebrafish blood development. Research collaborations, and resources will assist the candidate in the development of the skills and autonomy required to become a successful, independent investigator."
2458,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Two recently published papers have raised concerns about exposure to high levels >=16 milligauss (mG)] of magnetic fields (MFs) during pregnancy and the risk of miscarriage. Power frequency MFs are ubiquitous and about 75% of pregnant women were exposed to MF levels >=16 mG. Therefore, if the reported association of prenatal exposure to MFs >=16 mG with the risk of miscarriage (relative risk ranging from 1.8 to 5.7) is true, it will have significant public health implications. To further examine this association, we propose to conduct a population-based prospective cohort study among susceptible and non-susceptible pregnant women. We will over-sample susceptible women defined as having a history of multiple miscarriages. As demonstrated in our preliminary study, a MF effect on miscarriage is greater among susceptible women than among the overall pregnant population. Further evaluating the MF-miscarriage association among both susceptible and nonsusceptible women has the advantage of increasing the sensitivity of detecting a MF effect and providing an opportunity to compare the difference in the magnitude of the MF effect. The study will be conducted among members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program Northern California Region, a group-model integrated healthcare delivery system with 32,000 births each year. We will recruit a total of 1,000 pregnant women: 500 with a history of multiple miscarriages and 500 without such a history. In-person interviews will be conducted to collect information on known risk factors for miscarriage. Participants will be asked to wear a meter for 24 hours to capture their personal MF exposure from all sources and to keep a diary of her activities. Pregnancy outcomes will be ascertained through a combination of searching computerized databases, review of medical charts, and telephone follow-up. The Cox proportional hazard regression will be used to determine (a) whether exposure to MF levels =>16 mG during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, (b) whether there is a dose-response relationship, (c) whether this association is stronger for early miscarriage (< 10 weeks of gestation), and (d) whether this association differs between women with and without a history of multiple miscarriages. The proposed study will also significantly improve MF exposure measurements including an enhanced meter capability, repeat measurements, identifying sources of high MF exposure, and measurements on a typical day. Our experience and expertise gained from the recently completed study of MF-miscarriage association should provide significant assurance for the success of the proposed study. The findings from the proposed study will provide much needed confirmation of the recently reported results and advance our understanding of a MF health effect."
2486,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Formation and accumulation of aggregates in a fibrillar form - also referred as amyloid and amyloid-like fibrils- are often associated with cellular impairment and cell death. This is the case for Huntington's disease and other CAG repeat disorders where the presence of an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyGln) sequence in the disease protein leads the protein to aggregate and form neuronal inclusions. Although linked to the enhanced ability of long polyGln sequences to self-associate to form oligomers and aggregates, the exact mechanism by which these molecules promote neurodegeneration is still unclear. As of today, there are three schools of thought: aggregates are non-toxic and in fact beneficial and protective for the cell; aggregates are toxic only as oligomers/growth intermediates; and aggregates are just an epiphenomena. Since our long term goal is to find a cure for these CAG repeat diseases it is important to have a better understanding of the disease mechanism. Our preliminary data indicate that we possess a high-throughput screening assay that can identify small chemical compounds capable of modulating polyGln aggregation, the resulting formed and stabilized aggregates presenting structures very different from a regular aggregate. Based on our hypothesis that the toxicity of a polyGln aggregate depends on its structure and from our preliminary data, we propose to: (1) use the high-throughput assay to screen more compound libraries and identify additional polyGln aggregation modulators. Dose-response-curve experiments will be conducted in order to validate, rank and optimize the new hits; (2) employ biophysical methods such as light scattering, amyloid dye binding, sedimentation experiments coupled with reverse phase liquid chromatography, Fourier transformed infra-red, and electron microscopy to characterize the effect of an optimized compound on the aggregation reaction and on the aggregate structure; (3) conduct cellular experiments to test if there is a correlation between the various aggregate structures, modified or stabilized by polyGln aggregation modulators, and the cytotoxicity effect. In one case, modified aggregates will be introduced into cells, in the other case, cells expressing, after induction, the N-term part of huntingtin (disease protein in Huntington's disease) containing regular or pathological polyGln sequence will be exposed to compounds to be tested. NARRATIVE: Huntington's disease is one of the eight inherited neurological disorders that are caused by a DNA abnormality: the presence of additional CAG trinucleotide repeats in the disease gene. Huntington's disease, for which no cure exists, is a fatal illness causing involuntary movements and cognitive decline and strikes generally in mid-life. Its prevalence is about 10 cases per 100,000 people in the USA and, unfortunately, each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of developing the disease. In this proposal we will study one of the disease mechanisms, termed aggregation, which is thought to be a major player in the disease progression. Our results will help make advances in the understanding of the pathology and also in the treatment of Huntington's disease patients."
2512,HHS,HHS,"In all eukarotic cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms a highly fenestrated tubular network thatspreads throughout the volume of the cell, often lying just below the plasma membrane. This distributionmay be critical for calcium signalling and other important cellular functions. We have taken a geneticapproach towards understanding the mechanism of ER dynamics, structure and inheritance in yeast. Ourwork to date shows that ER tubules form from the nucler envelope at the start of the cell cycle, they aredelivered into the bud along actin cables by the type V myosin, Myo4p, they are anchored at the bud tip bythe exocyst complex and then spread along the cell cortex to form the cortical ER. We propose that Rtn1 p,a member of the conserved reticulon family of proteins, functions as the receptor for the exocyst subunitSec6p on the ER membrane and that Rtn1 p also serves to link the ER to the cell cortex. Four specific aimsare planned:1) We will analyze the interaction of Rtnlp with the exocyst, defining the topology of Rtnlp within the ERmembrane and the specific interactions that link the exocyst to Rtnlp.2) We will determine if Rtnlp binds to the Tcb3 protein along the cortex and if this interaction underlies theunique localization of Rtnlp as well as the tight association of the ER with the cell cortex.3) We will determine if Rtnlp plays a role in forming the fenestrated reticulum characteristic of the ER in alleukaryotes and if it interacts with other components of the ER membrane in this capacity.4) We will express or microinject dominant negative alleles of mammalian reticulon proteins as well as makeuse of RNAi methodology to inhibit the function of the four mammalian RTN proteins. Phenotypic analysiswill determine if the roles of Rtnlp and its interactions are conserved."
2574,HHS,NSF,"A major task of the kidney tubule is to reabsorb filtered HCO3 and generate  new  HCO^, thereby preventing a fatal meta-bolic acidosis. About 80% of HCO] reabsorption and generation occurs in the proximal tubule (PT), which secretes H+ intothe tubule lumen, titratingHCO3 to CO2 + H2O. After entering the PT cell, the CO2 + H2O regenerate HCOJ, which exitsacross the basolateral membrane via the electrogenic Na/HCO3 cotransporter (NBCel-A). Since the Pi's laboratory reportedthe expression cloning of this cotransporter nearly 5 yrs ago, both  pancreatic  (NBCel-B) and  brain  (NBCel-C) splicevariants have been identified. These cotransporters play key roles in HCO3 transport by other epithelia,and in pH(regulationby many cell types. NBCel is part of the Bicarbonate Transporter (BT) superfamily, along with the Cl-HCOj exchangers(AEs), two other Na+-coupled HCO3 transporters (the electroneutral NBC and the Na+-driven C1-HCO3 exchanger), relatedproteins not yet fully characterized, and at least one new gene (known from human genome sequence). The major goal ofthis project is to elucidate the molecular physiology of electrogenic NBCs, particularly in the kidney.An ancillary goal is toelucidate the expression of other Na+-coupled HCO3 transporters in key renal cell types. The proposed work has three aims:(i) Develop molecular tools. We will obtain the cDNA for a new NBCe-related sequence identified in the genome, extendour panel of type-specific antibodies, and determine the localization of Na+-coupled HCC>3 transporters in the kidney, (ii)Determine properties of wild-type electrogenic NBCs. Using heterologous expression in oocytes, we will determine thefunction of two cDNA clones likely to encode electrogenic NBCs. We will also determine the stoichiometry of the electro-genic NBCs; assess their dependence on Na+, HCO3 and pH; ask whether they transport CO3; characterize the interactionbetween NBCel and carbonic anhydrase II; and examine the action of PKA on NBCel in oocytes. (Hi) Analyze structure-function relationships. We will determine the structural requirements for extra- and intracellular DIDS sensitivity, askwhether conserved putative DIDS-reaction motifs are involved in electrostatictrapping of HCO3, assess naturally occurringhuman NBCel mutations, explore the topology of NBCel, and¿in collaboration with another laboratory¿study the bio-chemistry of the isolated cytoplasmic N termini of NBCel-A and -B. The proposed work should elucidate the role that theelectrogenic Na/HCO3 cotransporter plays in renal function, both in health and disease. The results could have importantimplications for understanding the normal control of acid-base balance and renal-tubuleacidosis."
2590,HHS,HHS,"Ovarian follicle development is a dynamic process that requires exquisite regulation of multiple cell types in the ovary in response to locally produced and extragonadal factors at each stage of development. In this competitive renewal of our Program Project we will combine our various expertise's in nuclear receptors, mouse models, ovarian histopathology, neuroendocrine regulation, and signaling into three comprehensive and highly interactive projects to evaluate the mechanisms by which activin, estrogen, and FSH signal to regulate ovarian follicular development. Interruption of the normal signaling by any of these factors results ininfertility or subfertility. We will test the hypotheses that activin plays a critical role in normal development of the ovarian follicles, that normal follicular development requires signaling through estrogen receptor alpha that is not dependent on its binding to DNA estrogen response elements, and that FSH-directed signaling via protein kinase A and consequently the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway simultaneously disengages an inhibitory pathway that restrains granulosa cell differentiation and stimulates differentiation. The research projects and supporting cores are: Project I, Activin Regulation of Ovarian Follicle Development, Drs.

2591,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MRNA localization and local translation are required for processes ranging from mating type switching in yeast to learning and memory in mammals, yet the mechanisms driving mRNA transport and silencing in higher eukaryotic systems remain poorly understood. Axis specification in Drosophila melanogaster provides particularly dramatic examples of coordinated mRNA transport and translational silencing. Bicoid and oskar mRNA are synthesized in a cluster of nurse cells, assemble into transport particles, and move through cytoplasmic bridges (ring canals) to the oocyte. Within the oocyte, microtubules are required for bicoid mRNA localization to the anterior pole and oskar mRNA accumulation at the posterior pole. oskar mRNA is silent until mid-oogenesis, when it is localized to the posterior pole of the oocyte. Bicoid mRNA remains translationally silent until early embryogenesis. We have developed an in vivo assay for bicoid mRNA localization that reveals multiple steps in the anterior mRNA localization pathway, and an in vitro -mRNA transport particle assembly system that recapitulates RNA behavior in vivo. These assays will be used to define RNA sequences and trans-acting proteins that drive anterior localization of bicoid mRNA (Aims 1 and 2). We have also identified a new axis specification gene, armitage, that is essential for oskar mRNA translational silencing and axis specification. The armitage gene is required for RNAi and efficient assembly of the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), and mutations in 3 additional RNAi components also disrupt oskar mRNA silencing and axis specification. The RNAi machinery thus appears to be essential to embryonic axis specification. The function of armitage in RNAi and RISC assembly, and the role of RNAi in axis specification, are examined in Aims 3 and 4. Aim 5 addresses a possible role for ATR/Chk2 tumor suppressor pathway in regulating RNAi. These studies will thus elucidate molecular mechanisms of mRNA localization and translational silencing that are essential to embryonic axis specification."

In children with typicallydeveloping language, it is possible to detect some types of partial word knowledge from one exposure(Dickinson, 1984; Wagovich & Newhoff, 2004); a critical next step is the examination of the types of partialword knowledge that develop from a single exposure in children with LLD. In addition, an evaluation isneeded of the roles of language and memory abilities in the development of vocabulary knowledge inchildren with LLD, compared to children with typically developing language. The specific aims of the proposed project are the detection of the types of partial word knowledgegrowth from one exposure for children with LLD, the comparison of the partial word knowledge types thatdevelop for children with LLD and their peers with typical language development, and the examination of theroles of language and memory abilities in partial word knowledge growth. The performance of children withLLD will be compared to that of children similar in age and children similar in reading comprehensionabilities. Using a pre/posttest design, children will read stories containing unfamiliar nouns and verbs, andpartial word knowledge growth will be assessed. This study will contribute to an understanding of the typesof partial word knowledge children with LLD demonstrate and retain in the beginning of the word learningprocess, relative to peers with typically developing language. The long-term objective of this researchprogram is to elucidate differences in the overall processes of word knowledge growth, from LLD children'sfirst encounter to their eventual mastery of a word's meaning. Focus on the specific processes of word learning is essential from a public health perspective, becauseit enables development of intervention procedures for school-age children with LLD. If, for example, thesechildren are found to have difficulty acquiring a particular type of word knowedge, such as part of speech,vocabulary intervention can be designed to focus on this aspect of word knowledge, in particular."
2633,HHS,HHS,"This application describes a two-year research scholar development program to identify and characterizesmall molecular inhibitors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion system. The long term goal is toestablish a highly productive and well funded research program in the interaction of bacterial pathogens andhost cells utilizing the inhibitors outlined in this proposal. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that isthe leading cause of Gram-negative nosocomial infections. One factor that contributes to the virulence of thisbacteria is the type III secretion system. Type III secretion system is a complex of over twenty proteins thatallows for delivery of proteins called effector molecules directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into thecytoplasm of the eukaryotic host. P. aeruginosa delivers two highly cytotoxic effector molecules, ExoS andExoU. This mechanism of toxin delivery is shared among many bacterial pathogens including Yersinia,Salmonella, Shigella, enteropathogenic E. coli, Chlamydia and many others. The prevalence of thisconserved system suggests that type III secretion is an ideal target for inhibition to prevent infection by thesebacterial pathogens. This proposal aims to identify small molecular inhibitors by a high-throughput assay thatmeasures protection of host cells to infection by P. aeruginosa. Protective compounds will be classified bythe inhibitory step in the type III injection pathway. Related molecules to the original protective compoundswill allow identification of more potent inhibitors. The biological specificity of the inhibitors on the type IIIinjection pathway will be tested in other pathogens that utilize type III secretion systems. Furthermore, adirect link between the inhibitor and type III secretion component will be made by identification of the genetictarget of each class of inhibitors. The tools generated in this proposal can be used to dissect biological stepsthat are shared or distinct between a number of bacterial pathogens that utilize type III secretion to establishinfections. Furthermore, the small molecule inhibitors identified in this proposal may be used as a startingpoint for the development of theraputics to inhibit bacterial infection caused by Gram-negative pathogensthat utilize type III seceretion."
2635,HHS,HHS,"The adipoeyte-secreted hormone leptin signals the amount of energy stored in adipose tissue to the centralnervous system. We have shown, in the context of this grant, that leptin administration to normalize therelative leptin deficiency induced by short term energy deficiency results in normalization of reproductive andother neuroendocrine defects. We have also shown that altering leptin levels within the normal physiologicalrange, or into supraphysiological levels, has no effect on the same outcomes. Thus, in humans, leptin servesas a critical link between the sufficiency of energy stores and the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-peripheral axes in states of leptin deficiency only. We have subsequently hypothesized that the abnormalitiesin the reproductive and other neuroendocrine axes in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA), acondition associated with low leptin levels, may also be related to the chronic hypoleptinemia induced bynegative energy balance. In a recently completed, open-label, small pilot study using historical controls, wefound that leptin replacement to correct the relative leptin deficiency in women with HA resulted in folliculargrowth and ovulation and significantly improved hormone levels, providing preliminary evidence that leptinmay contribute to the etiology of the amenorrhea and that leptin replacement may be a potential treatmentfor disease states associated with relative leptin deficiency. The goal of this proposal is to confirm andextend these preliminary findings by performing a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial ofleptin treatment in women with HA and leptin deficiency which would eliminate potential bias andconfounding and would verify safety and efficacy of leptin as a new treatment for HA. Since HA accounts forover 30% of amenorrhea in reproductive-aged women and can have significant deleterious effects on fertility,bone health, and overall well-being, this study would have considerable clinical impact if leptin becomes anew, more physiologic, therapeutic option for HA. This is particularly relevant since currently availabletreatment options for HA have side effects, are not well accepted by some patients, and have suboptimaleffectiveness for complications such as osteoporosis. Results of this study will not only help elucidate thepathophysiology of HA but will also provide important new information on leptin physiology in neuroendocrineregulation, bone metabolism and immune function at large, using HA as a model of chronic leptin deficiency.Thus, findings of this study to elucidate leptin physiology may also have applications in the pathophysiology(and possibly therapeutics) of other leptin related diseases, including obesity, a major public health problem."
2642,HHS,NSF,"Central pattern generators (CPGs) are rhythmically active neural networks that underlie many stereotypedand repetitive voluntary muscle movements such as whisking or fluid licking. Fluid licking in rodents is anexample of a promising, simple model of a CPG: It is a highly stereotyped behavior characterized byrhythmic tongue and jaw movements, and it is thought to be controlled by a neural substrate distributed inthe medullary reticular formation in the brainstem. In preliminary observations, we have demonstrated thatmice are a superb species choice for investigating the genetic basis of the licking CPG- the common inbredstrains C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) have a robust, non-overlapping phenotypic difference in lick rate.The identification of genes underlying differences in lick rate should have a huge payout for the study ofCPGs. Mice can then created with gene-targeted deletions or insertions, allowing for specific physiological oranatomical investigation. We propose to take advantage of a newly augmented resource for our geneticdissection of licking: The BXD advanced recombinant inbred (Rl) strain set. These mice will allow forprecision genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) that underlie behavioral traits. We propose to use anovel high-throughput assay for lick rate to test a set of -80 BXD Rl strains, and map quantitative trait loci(QTLs) with high precision that underlie strain variation in lick rate.Relevance: Complex animals such as humans possess a number of motor responses that are stereotypicand/or repetitive in nature. Comparison of the genes and mechanisms underlying stereotyped repetitivemovements vs. plastic behaviors will be a source of information relevant for a number of human CMSdisorders involving abnormal repetitive movements."
2655,HHS,NSF,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an essential regulator of calcium homeostasis and also has a role as ananabolic hormone for bone. PTH induces matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) gene transcription inosteoblastic cells through a cAMP-dependent pathway requiring de novo protein synthesis, i.e., this is asecondary event. We have identified the PTH-response elements as being the runt domain and the activatorprotein-1 binding sites in the MMP-13 promoter. We have demonstrated a PTH-dependent cooperativeinteraction between the sites and the proteins (Runx2 and Fos/Jun) binding to them. We have nowestablished that these two sites in the MMP-13 promoter are in a single nucleosome close to the TATA boxand PTH relaxes and modifies this nucleosome but does not cause its dissociation. The relaxation is theproduct of several steps which occur as early and late events: In the early events, first, PTH stimulates p300(a histone acetyltransferase, HAT) activity, causes the phosphorylation of Runx2, and p300 is recruited tothe promoter resulting in early site-specific acetylation of histone H4; in the late events, newly synthesizedFos/Jun associate with the promoter and then appear to interact with Runx2 followed by recruitment of CBP(CREB binding protein), another HAT, to the entire proximal promoter and acetylation of histone H3 resultingin loosening of the nucleosome. Maximal transcription of the MMP-13 gene then ensues. Our hypothesis isthat the gene is in a repressed state and PTH causes the stepwise modification of the chromatin thoughdissociation of histone deacetylases and co-repressor proteins and association of HATs and activatorproteins. The long-term goals of this work are to delineate the mechanisms conveying PTH action toregulation of transcription of the MMP-13 gene in osteoblasts. Consequently, the specific aims of thiscompeting continuation proposal are to, 1) investigate the early events at the RD site of the MMP-13promoter, and, 2) investigate the late events at the AP-1 site and the interaction of Fos/Jun with otherproteins on the MMP-13 promoter. The results of this work will make major contributions to our knowledge ofhow PTH exerts its nuclear effects on osteoblast function. In so doing, the data will also provide newperspectives into treatment of disorders of calcium metabolism.This research will investigate how a protein hormone (parathyroid hormone, PTH) is able to interact with acell's surface and transmit signals to the nucleus to cause the DMAand associated proteins to change theirstructure and cause expression of an enzyme involved in bone breakdown. PTH is essential for regulatingserum calcium levels, and is also being used to treat osteoporosis. The results of our research could lead tonew drugs being developed, in place of PTH, to treat osteoporosis."
2661,HHS,HHS,"Primary surgical repair of a cleft lip has significant potential for scarring and disfigurement of the upper lipand nose that requires further correction. Patients, their parents, and the operating surgeons must decidewhether the benefits of a secondary lip revision following primary correction of a cleft lip outweigh the risks.Until recently, quantitative data on the benefits of revision surgery have been lacking, and the clinicalrecommendations for or against revision surgery have necessarily been based on subjective and, therefore,variable evaluations. In the initial grant period, a non-randomized clinical trial was conducted that resulted insignificant progress towards the development and characterization of objective quantitative outcomes ofrevision surgery in patients with cleft lip and palate. The database so established is now the only one in theworld that has extensive objective measures of three-dimensional facial soft-tissue movement andmorphology, lip force, lip sensation, and sensory-integrative function. The investigations proposed hererepresent an expansion of this research. Thus, the goals of this continuing project are as follows. 1) To determine how surgeons might use thenewly-developed objective measures of lip function in the decision-making process for or against lip revisionsurgery. 2) To establish  parameters of care  criteria for secondary lip revision treatment based onstandardized, systematic subjective evaluations, and objective measurements. 3) To investigate the long-term functional outcomes of lip revision surgery. This information will be obtained by continuing the presentclinical trial and by enrolling an additional cohort of 30 new patients who will receive lip revision surgery. Thecentral hypothesis continues to be that  although contemporary lip revision surgery may improve lip form atrest, function may be further impaired . This research will enable surgeons to address the following outcomes, and in doing so provide improvedpatient care: 1) measure the specific functional deficits that are present post-primary lip repair; 2) assess theeffectiveness of current primary and secondary lip operations; 3) assess the long-term effects of lip repair onthe maintenance of the circumoral milieu; 4) determine whether secondary lip surgery results in significantimprovement in lip form and function; and 5) determine whether additional surgery is really warranted. In thefuture, these evaluations can be used to determine the outcomes of different surgical techniques forlip-revision surgery."
2676,HHS,HHS,"The Portland Alcohol Research Center (PARC) focuses on the etiology and prediction of risk of alcoholabuse, alcoholism, and specific alcohol-related health problems (e.g., withdrawal seizures). The genetic riskand protective markers that we are studying will be of utility in the future for prevention of alcoholism. Thefirst theme of the PARC is to use behavioral genomics strategies, through studies of gene mappingand expression, and development of new genetic animal models, to identify genes underlyingethanol neuroadaptation. The other main PARC theme is exploring mechanisms underlying and traitsrelated to ethanol neuroadaptation. Two specific hypotheses have developed from the synthesis of PARCand related projects' findings. The first is the intriguing idea that withdrawal and drinking may be influencedby some of the same genes. The second emergent hypothesis is that high impulsivity is a significant geneticrisk factor for high alcohol drinking. Five research components, four core components, and a pilot projectcomponent address these themes and hypotheses. An Education and Outreach component trains pre andpostdoctoral students in alcohol research, disseminates research findings to the public, and engages in arange of activities with elementary-to-high school students. Three research projects focus intensively onmapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for alcohol preference and withdrawal genes in mice. During thecurrent period of funding, we have pursued one QTL and have successfully mapped the firstquantitative trait gene (QTG) for an alcohol-related behavioral response, Mpdz, which influencesalcohol withdrawal severity. Our gene finding approaches are evolving to include a major emphasis onmapping QTGs whose effects on the trait are derived from differences in regulation of gene expression. Thiseffort has led to a significant expansion in our bioinformatics efforts. A fourth, new component is developingnovel mouse models for impulsive behavior, establishing their genetic basis, and relating them to alcoholconsumption. The fifth component, also new, takes advantage of access to a large colony of rhesusmonkeys, all of whom have been genotyped in a full-genome linkage scan, and were tested at 3 months oldfor temperament-related traits (e.g., anxiety). These animals will be given an alcohol challenge at 1 year oldto determine individual differences in alcohol-induced ataxia and anxiolysis. Our hope is to test themeventually for alcohol self-administration, and retrospectively to discover predictors of alcohol selfadministration.The other new feature in the renewal is a pilot project that will perform the first clinical studyin the PARC, a clinical trial of metoclopramide, to see whether impulsivity predicts response."
2685,HHS,NSF,"Molecular docking is now routinely used as a method in virtual screening for lead compound generation andoptimization. A limitation of docking into a single protein conformation for virtual screening is that ignoringprotein flexibility will reduce predictive power. Many molecular docking algorithms have been optimized forfast and accurate docking of a flexible ligand into a static protein structure. Therefore, an attractive approachto incorporate protein flexibility is to use a small number of representative protein structures for rigid docking.For a test set of 12 proteins, several conformational sampling techniques will be used to generaterepresentative protein ensembles for molecular docking. The results of rigid docking into multiple crystalstructures will be compared against rigid docking into generated protein ensembles. These results will beused to develop a new algorithm that directly incorporates protein flexibility into the docking procedure withtorsion angle dynamics. In virtual screening, the potential benefits of including protein flexibility (fewer falsenegatives) would be diminished if flexibility also leads to a higher false positive rate. To investigate this issue,many ligands known to bind to our target proteins with low affinity will also be included in our study."
2698,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer prevention involving reduction or elimination of human exposure to environmental carcinogens may not always be possible. Inhibition of the development of cancer by the administration of anticarcinogenic agents may offer a practical alternative for reducing human cancer burden. However, the successful utilization of chemopreventive interventions will require solid mechanistic understanding of the action(s) of these agents. Dithiolethiones are amongst the most broadly effective classes of chemopreventive agents in experimental models; clinical trials also indicate their efficacy in populations exposed to dietary aflatoxins or tobacco smoke. The objectives of this investigation remain to define the mechanisms of chemoprevention afforded by dithiolethiones and related compounds. Highly quantitative animal model systems for interrelating the molecular, biochemical, and biological actions of these chemopreventive agents have been developed and will be used in i) the development and characterization of new, potent dithiolethiones, ii) the identification of novel genes modulated by dithiolethiones, iii) probing the specific contributions of these induced genes to chemoprevention, and iv) the validation of intermediate biomarkers to assess the efficacy of anticarcinogenic interventions. Recent gene discovery activities indicate that dithiolethiones affect the expression of many genes that are likely to repress the cytotoxic and autopromoting actions of carcinogens in addition to their genotoxic ones. Thus, investigations of the cytoprotective mechanisms of dithiolethiones form the primary focus of this renewal. Functional consequences of induction of protective pathways by dithiolethiones, including STAT signaling, proteasome activation, and carcinogen metabolism by aldehyde reductases, will be probed through a series of in vitro assays and studies in transgenic animals using a panel of validated intermediate biomarkers. Structure-activity studies of a large dithiolethione library will probe their tissue and cell-type specific pharmacodynamic action in a reporter mouse to better inform matching of agents with target tissues. This library will also be screened for analogs in addition to oltipraz that inhibit and reverse the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis, a key step in liver cancer. Collectively, these studies will further the goal of effectively using dithiolethiones as protective agents in human populations exposed to environmental toxicants."
2728,HHS,NSF,"Notch signaling regulates multiple aspects of hematopoietic development. Notch receptors are aconservedfamily that influence cell fates, survival, proliferation, and borderformation in multi-cellular organisms.Thiscompeting renewal represents our long-term plan to understand the function of Notch signaling inhematopoietic development and function. We and others have providedevidence that Notch regulates T cellcommitment from a multi-potential progenitor and regulates multiple aspects of intrathymic T celldevelopment, The proposed studies focus on the function of Notch signaling in T cell commitment and earlythymocyte development, In Specific Aim 1, we will identify the bone marrow, intra-thymic and extra-thymicprogenitors upon which Notch acts to specify T cell commitment.In Specific Aim 2, we will determine thefunction of Notch signaling and identify the mechanism by which Notch influences multiple events duringearly thymocytedevelopment. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanism that downregulatesNotchsignaling at the DN3-DN4 transition.

2759,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in the population and carry a significant burden of distress and impairment. Current treatments are limited, and, compared to other psychiatric conditions, research in anxiety disorders has been relatively neglected. Exploring their genetic determinants will help elucidate their causes and guide research for prevention and new treatments. We propose to test candidate anxiety disorder susceptibility genes selected from preliminary mouse and human data in a unique human genetic epidemiologic sample. We used multivariate structural equation modeling to identify common genetic risk factors for related phenotypes of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, major depression, and neuroticism in a sample of 9270 adult subjects from the population-based Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. One member from each twin pair for whom DNA was available is selected as a case or control based upon scoring at the extremes of the genetic factor extracted from the analysis. The resulting sample of 589 cases and 539 controls will be entered into a two- stage association study in which candidate loci are screened in stage 1, the positive results of which are tested for replication in stage 2. This two-stage design was chosen to reduce genotyping costs and control false-discovery rates. Potential bias from population stratification will be assessed and controlled using data from a set of highly-informative anonymous markers genotyped in the entire sample. Primary data from a whole-genome association study in mouse fear-related phenotypes will be used to identify a preliminary set of candidate genomic regions. This will be integrated with other data from genome-wide linkage and association studies in human and animal anxiety phenotypes to select a smaller set of high-priority candidate genes for testing in our human sample. Haplotype-tagging and functional polymorphic SNPs, where available, will be chosen from publicly-available databases using standard algorithms to incorporate the main sources of genetic variation across these candidate gene regions. To our knowledge, this is the first application to systematically integrate information derived from primary animal studies of fear-related phenotypes with human anxiety disorder data to identify the susceptibility genes for these conditions."
2764,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasma gelsolin (PG), the extracellular isoform of a six domain protein that has an intracellular counterpart, functions in blood to disassemble actin filaments as part of the actin scavenging system. D187 mutations in PG render domain 2 proteolytically labile and aggregation prone, leading to a gain of toxic function disease associated with the process of amyloidogenesis. We have discovered that the D187(N,Y) mutations prevent Ca2+ binding to domain 2, rendering plasma gelsolin susceptible to aberrant endoproteolysis by furin in the Golgi during secretion. Once outside the cell, the 68 kDa fragment is cleaved again by specific matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) including MT1-MMP (MMP14) affording 5 and 8 kDa fragments. The amyloidogenesis of these fragments is hastened by sulfated glycosaminoglycan components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) found in affected tissues. The overall goals of this work are to understand the amyloid pathological cascade and to develop an effective therapeutic strategy against the gelsolin amyloidoses. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the peptides comprising human amyloid to be sure we identify all MMPs involved, perform biophysical studies that will reveal the mechanism of gelsolin amyloidogenesis and elucidate how the oligosaccharides composing the ECM accelerate and possibly stabilize gelsolin amyloid. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on developing and characterizing both cell-based and murine models of gelsolin familial amyloidosis (FAF). Cell-based models will allow us to characterize the trafficking pathways involved in FAF disease and understand compartmentalization of the pathological cascade. The FAF mouse model developed in the first funding period faithfully recapitulates many features of FAF pathology, including the intracellular inclusions also associated with inclusion body myositis (IBM), the most common muscle degenerative disease in the aging population. These valuable models will be used both to scrutinize our understanding of the FAF pathogenic cascade and to evaluate therapeutic strategies. In Specific aim 3, we will use the cell- and murine-based models of FAF to evaluate the potential of MMP inhibitors and small molecules that antagonize the ECM-gelsolin amyloid interaction to ameliorate FAF. The elucidation of the FAF pathogenic cascade together with the development of candidate pharmacologic agents will significantly advance our understanding of human amyloid diseases."
2767,HHS,NSF,"We shall develop an evidence-based hierarchical family of paradigmatic model frameworks for the temporaland spatial spread of two directly transmitted infections of farm animals: Avian Influenza (Al) and Foot andMouth Disease(FMD. With respect to modeling disease systems we shall create both local (withinherd/flock), county, state and national models of Al and FMD. The heirarchical strategy is important becausethe simpler models can be completed more quickly and parameterized more readily and are therefore morelikely to be available for use than the more complicated models. Their behavior can more easily begeneralized to other systems and can inform response measures in a strategic (if not tactical) sense. Themore complicated models are essential tactical instruments but will take longer to complete and theirbehavior may not be so easily generalized to other infections. Our proposal represents a compromisebetween the need to provide useful strategic information about a range of potential threats - and therequirement that we can inform tactical decisions about prevention, response and recovery. Among otherthings, we shall investigate the appropriate level of granularity (scale) for each of these models. There arefew regions in the USA where farms locations are mapped to level of detail required for most existing typesof models for spatial and temporal spread at state or national scales. We shall devise models(metapopulation/ Patch/ Gravity models) based on other spatial resolutions (eg data based on zip codes,counties, or a national grid system). We shall test and calibrate these approximations using detailed spatialstochastic models developed using detailed and extensive GIS data bases on farm location in Pennsylvaniaand then extend their use to other regions in the USA. We shall use the models to devise and refinestrategies for prevention, response and recovery.Avian Influenza and Foot and Mouth Disease are potential agents of bio/agroterrorism in addition to beingdevastating animal epidemic diseases in their own right which have have dramatic adverse effects on thewell-being (social, economic and psycholgical) of human populations. The models proposed here will assistin planning strategies for prevention, control and response. In the case of Avian Influenza especially,controlling the infection in birds is a pre-emptive strategy for control in people."
2769,HHS,NSF,"While SIV infected Asian macaque monkeys develop disease very similar to humans infected with HIV, SIVinfected African mangabey monkeys do not develop disease. Defining the mechanisms that distinguishdisease susceptibility and resistance is the goal of our studies.Loss of CD4+ T cells accompanied by loss of appropriate CD4+ T cell function is the hallmark of pathogenicHIV-1 infection and SIV infection of select Asian species of nonhuman primates (NHP), such as rhesusmacaques (RM). However, some NHP species, such as sooty mangabeys (SM) that are natural hosts ofSIV, do not experience similar CD4+ T cell dysfunction and do not develop disease despite relatively highviral loads that are comparable to those present in SIV infected rhesus macaques that develop AIDS likedisease. The precise mechanism(s) that lead to such loss of CD4+ T cells function has yet to be defined, butone of these mechanisms is a development of massive susceptibility of the both infected and non-infected - bystander - CD4+ T cells - to undergo immune mediated SIV induced dysfunction leading to the decrease inT cell responses, while, at the same time lymphocytes from SIV infected SM do not show similar CD4+ T celldysfunction and maintain proper T cell responses. It was also documented that HIV and SIV virionsincorporate wide range of host cell derived proteins that may play an important role in virus inducedpathology. We submit that the differential clinical outcome of SIV infection in RM and SM provides for aunique tool to define and distinguish those mechanisms that are critical for the development of or resistanceto SIV induced disease in RM or SM, respectively. The objective of this proposal therefore is focused first onthe analysis of the SIV particles and host derived proteins associated with SIV in RM and SM and their rolein the induction of SIV induced CD4+ T cell dysfunction. Subsequently we will characterize the roles of Aktand Cox2 signaling, two signaling pathways that are critical for multiple T cell functions, in SIV mediated Tcell dysfunction. And lastly, the studies will evaluate DMA methylation as a downstream regulatorymechanism elicited by SIV induced T cell signaling and its role the dysfunction of the CD4+ T cells SIVinfection. These proposed studies address in a stepwise fashion the potential effects that SIV may exhibit oneach stage of the signal transduction machinery from the engagement of the receptor on cell surface downto the epigenetic regulation of transcription of critical effector genes at the promoter level. The approach ofthe utilization of the two NHP models of SIV infection will allow for the characterization of those SIV effects orcellular mechanisms that are critical for those pathogenic and,conversely, it may lead to the characterizationof those mechanisms that antagonize these virus induced defects and contribute to resistance to lentivirusinduced immune dysfunction and disease observed in SM."
2773,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current models of spoken language production postulate that the linguistic system is composed of a network of lexical and semantic nodes that automatically spread activation to each other as part of linguistic processing. This automatic spread of activation is implicit, in that it occurs outside of conscious awareness or control. Intact implicit processing is thought to underlie the automatic, fluent, rapid use of language in typical adults. Implicit processing is also a component of learning and, therefore, a component of any language rehabilitation that may be undertaken to remediate language deficits following stroke (i.e., aphasia). Previous research has raised the question of whether automatic activation of the linguistic system is preserved or impaired in aphasia. If there is a deficit in the spread of automatic activation in individuals with aphasia, this may underlie their language deficits, and/or may influence their response to treatment. The studies proposed here will investigate the nature of implicit learning, in the form of priming, in individuals with anomia, a ubiquitous symptom of aphasia. Using a masked priming picture naming paradigm, it will use accuracy and reaction time data to compare thresholds of explicit awareness in anomic and typical adults, and will compare the response of anomic and typical adults to implicit vs. explicit identity primes across three prime-target latencies. Findings from this research will inform our understanding of implicit, automatic activation processes in aphasia as they relate both to models of language use and to methods of learning in aphasia rehabilitation."
2793,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the recent downward trend in drug use, the prevalence of injection drug abuse is still higher than in the early 1990s. The health and social consequences of drug abuse - HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, violence, and crime - have a devastating impact on society and cost billions of dollars each year. Injection drug abuse is particularly remarkable in that abusers face unique secondary consequences of their addictions, such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, which are both potential complicating factors in their overall treatment. Among injection drug users with HIV/AIDS, the grampositive bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the principle causative agent of TB infections seen. Treatment for TB infections against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in these populations involves the administration of the antibiotics rifampicin and isoniazid but emerging multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB strains have seriously compromised and complicated treatment. To explore alternative methodologies for the treatment and control of TB infections we propose to study the antimicrobial peptide nisin. Over the last 50 years, nisin has demonstrated an undiminished selective cytotoxicity towards gram-positive bacteria. Recent in vitro studies have shown that nisin exhibits antimycobacterial activities by depleting ATP and the proton motive force in mycobacteria and also by causing the loss of the permeability barrier of the cytoplasmic membrane. The goal of the studies described herein is to understand the biosynthesis of nisin by investigating the enzymes responsible for its synthesis and to explore the hypothesis that modifications to these enzymes can generate novel enzymes capable of generating new antibiotics based on the nisin framework that display greater antimycobactericidal activity."
2808,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Choline is a dietary nutrient essential for the structural integrity and signaling functions of cell membranes; it is the major source of methyl-groups in the diet, and it directly affects cholinergic neurotransmission, transmembrane signaling and lipid transport/metabolism. The major premise for this proposal is that humans require a dietary source of choline and that this requirement has significant individual variation. We suggest that estrogen and common genetic polymorphisms modulate this dietary requirement for choline. During the last 4 years of funding we established that 77% of men and 80% of postmenopausal women, when deprived of dietary choline, developed fatty liver or muscle damage. Only 43% of premenopausal women developed signs of organ dysfunction associated with choline deficiency. Some men developed such signs of choline deficiency when ingesting the presumed Adequate Intake for choline (550 mg/day). We observed that the PEMT promoter is estrogen responsive, and we hypothesize that estrogen status influences the dietary requirement for choline. We identified common genetic variations that appear to increase the likelihood that a human will become choline deficient when fed a low choline diet; postmenopausal women with a common single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) in the promoter region of the gene responsible for endogenous biosynthesis of choline (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, PEMT; rs12325817) had a odds ratio (OR) compared to wild type of 42 for developing signs of organ dysfunction when we removed choline from their diets (p=0.03); premenopausal women with a G78T snp in choline dehydrogenase had an OR of 20 (p=0.04) and premenopausal women with a common snp in methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1-1958A) had an OR of >85 (p=.0001) for developing signs of choline deficiency. We identified another snp in choline dehydrogenase A40 that was associated with a decreased susceptibility to developing signs of choline deficiency in all subjects (OR = 0.2; p = 0.03). These snps are common in humans, for example, for the PEMT promoter snp 18% of our subjects were homozygous for the snp, 56% were heterozygous, and 26% were wild type. Therefore, it is important that we have a better understanding of how these genetic polymorphisms influence the dietary requirement for choline. We propose studies that will extend our observations during the last funding period and that will refine our understanding of factors that influence dietary requirements for choline in humans. Experiments are proposed that will determine whether postmenopausal women treated with estrogen have a lower choline requirement, identify functionally important SNPs, determine prevalence of these in the population and examine dietary choline requirements in humans with these SNPs."
2814,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant labor is a major clinical problem resulting in significant infant morbidity in spite of recent advances in obstetrical and neonatal care. The mechanisms that control labor onset and its progression, term or preterm, are not well understood. Rupture of the fetal membranes (ROM) is an integral event to the onset and development of the labor process. ROM usually follows the onset of uterine contractions. However, in 10% of term and 40% of preterm births, ROM is the sentinel event leading to uterine contractions and delivery. Thus, the mechanism of ROM has both physiological and clinical importance. Previous thinking that ROM results exclusively from physical stretch forces produced by uterine contractions has evolved to theories that ROM, at term, is a maturational event culminating from a gene controlled program of membrane weakening, including collagen modification and apoptosis. Preterm ROM, initiated in some cases by infection inflammation, and by as yet unknown causes in others, may involve premature activation of the same developmental program. Considerable work has been reported by us and other researchers documenting the ability of various agents to cause apoptosis in cultured cells derived from fetal membranes. However, there has been no direct demonstration that apoptosis and/or remodeling lead to membrane weakening, or to changes in membrane viscoelastic properties which make rupture more likely. We hypothesize that human fetal membranes weaken during gestation as a result of a combination of two processes: programmed biochemical changes leading to collagen remodeling and apoptosis, and superimposed physical stretch forces leading to tissue damage. Further, we suggest that stretch also initiates biochemical changes, which modify membrane viscoelastic properties. We propose a study documenting the one-to-one correspondence of the biochemical changes - apoptosis and membrane remodeling - and the physical weakening of the membranes. Initially we will determine the biochemical/histological characteristics over the topological surface of the fetal membranes and compare them with strength, and other physical properties. Second, we will prospectively inflict precise membrane damage with apoptotic agents or with physical forces and determine the resulting changes in histology and membrane strength. Finally, we will determine the requirements for membrane self repair after physical or biochemically mediated damage. Understanding the relationship between biochemical changes and physical properties of the fetal membranes may allow monitoring of, and/or intervention in, pregnancies at risk for premature delivery due to premature ROM."
2934,HHS,NSF,"We propose to continue our studies on the tyrosine kinase Src (also called c-Src), the cellular homolog of the v-Src oncoprotein. Activated Src causes transformation of some cell types and cancer in animals, but can stimulate differentiation, migration, survival or apoptosis when expressed in other cell types. Because activated Src phosphorylates many different cell proteins, the specific mechanisms underlying these different cellular outcomes have been difficult to dissect. Moreover, the roles of the normal cellular Src protein have been unclear, in part due to overlapping functions between Src and other close relatives. Src activity is elevated in many human cancers, including approximately 70% of carcinomas. Understanding a novel aspect of Src biology is the general goal of this proposal.Over the past funding period, our study of a Src substrate, Dab1, led us to uncover a Src-dependentsignaling pathway that regulates the migrations of neuronal precursors in the developing mammaliancentral nervous system. An extracellular protein, Reelin, acts via non-catalytic receptors to stimulate Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1. Genetic evidence shows that tyrosine phosphorylation ofDab1 is both a cause and a consequence of activation of Src, and both events are required fordownstream signaling. Reelin stimulates Dab1 binding to several identified signaling proteins, includingthe adaptor proteins Crk and CrkL. Reelin also stimulates Dab1 ubiquitylation and degradation, and Reelinreceptor endocytosis. However, it is not yet clear whether Dab1 ubiquitylation regulates signaling orendocytbsis or is a feedback control, and it remains unclear how Dab1 degradation, Reelin endocytosis,Dab1-complex formation, and Src kinase activation link to each other and regulate neuron precursormovements in vivo. Wepropose to use genetic and biochemical approaches to uncover the mechanismsby which Src and Dab1 regulate cell migrations in vivo.We propose two broad aims: to uncover the importance of different Dab1 phosphorylation sites andsignaling complexes and Dab1 degradation in Dab1 regulation and development; and to determine thespecific roles of Crk, CrkL, their downstream mediator C3G, and endocytosis in signaling. By further studyof this signaling process, we expect to identify principles of signal complex formation and regulation thatmay be relevant to other tyrosine kinase signaling pathways."
2961,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA Double strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomes can be caused by exogenous damaging agents (e.g. ionizing radiation), but are also produced as intermediates in normal recombination events, including V (D) J recombination. DSBs are lethal, thus must be repaired for cells to live; aberrant DSB repair is also linked to frequent tumor development. End joining in mammals requires at least Ku, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, DNA Ligase IV, and Artemis. However, how these factors function in these processes at the molecular level is not well understood, and even less is known how their function is impacted by chromatin structure. I. What is the function of DNA-PK kinase activity? The target of DNA-PKcs kinase activity most relevant in an in vitro end-joining assay will be determined. The hypothesis that kinase activity is a critical factor in ensuring DSBs are protected from modification until they are ready to be repaired will also be tested. II. How is nuclease activity accurately employed by end joining? Artemis is a recently identified nuclease that has a clear role in V (D) J recombination, but a more ambiguous role in general end joining repair. In vitro experiments will be performed to cladfy how other end joining factors impact Artemis activity, and if Artemis activity is controlled in an in vitro end joining reaction in an appropriate, context-dependent manner.  III. How does chromatin structure impact targeting and repair of DSBs in V (D) J recombination? Covalent modification of histones directs alterations in chromatin structure. These alterations in chromatin structure in turn are cdtical for the developmentally specific targeting of DSBs in V (D) J recombination, and they also play an important role in general repair of DSBs by the end joining pathway. A cell line model will be employed to determine what modifications are associated with inductien and resolution of DSB intermediates in V (D) J recombination. The consequences of preturbing-selected modifications will also be assessed. IV. How is the function of DSB repair factors effected by the nucleosome? Purified, defined mononucleosomes will be used to determine how this fundamental unit of chromatin structure alters the activities of core end joining components (Ku, DNA-PKcs, XRCC, 4, ligase IV) in vitro. Together, these aims will clarify how end joining works at the molecular level, and provide insight into how aberrant rearrangements occur when V (D) J recombination and end joining DSB repair goes awry."
2967,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The University of North Dakota STEER is designed to support undergraduate training in the environmental health sciences within the University of North Dakota. The STEER training program will expand and compliment the ongoing NIH IDeA INBRE program that is focused on fostering undergraduate biomedical research at the State's primarily undergraduate institutions and the enhancement of the undergraduate pipeline to the health professional schools. The North Dakota INBRE is focused on  Health and the Environment . The present application is targeted at filling an important gap in undergraduate training in the environmental sciences not provided by the North Dakota INBRE program. This gap is the support of undergraduate environmental science training for undergraduate students at the INBRE host research-intensive institution, the University of North Dakota. The present application will use the INBRE foundation to initiate a strong undergraduate training program in environmental health science at the University of North Dakota. The research theme will be to advance the hypothesis that environmental agents which elicit human disease cause cellular alterations in cell structure and function that can be identified as predictive biomarkers of disease development and progression. To advance this theme, the students will be involved in research that studies the role of the environmental pollutants, arsenic and cadmium, in the development and progression of human bladder, breast, prostate, and renal disease. The aims of the program are: to provide an undergraduate research experience in environmental sciences to undergraduate students at the University of North Dakota; to provide an introduction to environmental health sciences to undergraduate students at the University of North Dakota; and, to use infrastructure developed in the INBRE program to support STEER programmatic efforts and vice versa over the life of the award mechanisms."
2975,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mucopolysaccharidosis (MRS) diseases are a broad class of genetic disorders characterized by the excessive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) within the lysosomes of various tissues. Among these disorders, MPS I-H is the most severe form of an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of a-L-iduronidase (encoded by the IDUA gene), which participates in the degradation of GAGs within the lysosome. Recent studies have shown that certain aminoglycosides and other pharmacological agents have the ability to suppress stop mutations that cause a number of genetic diseases [For review, see Keeling and Bedwell, Current Pharmacogenomics 3: 259-269, (2005)]. Consistent with these previous results, we found that the aminoglycoside gentamicin can suppress the IDUA Q70X and W402X premature stop mutations (carried by ~70% of MPS I-H patients) and restore enough a-L-iduronidase activity to normalize GAG levels in cultured primary fibroblasts derived from an MPS I-H patient [Keeling et al., Human Molecular Genetics 10: 291-299 (2001)]. To further explore this novel therapeutic treatment, we recently succeeded in constructing an /c/tya-W402X knock-in mouse in which the /DLW-W402X premature stop mutation found in MPS I-H patients was introduced into the corresponding position in the mouse Idua gene. This new mouse model will allow us to test the hypothesis that the suppression of premature stop mutations and/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) can restore enough a-L-iduronidase activity to correct the disease manifestations of MPS I-H in vivo. To test this hypothesis and further develop and evaluate the utility of this treatment strategy, we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim #1: Characterize the phenotype associated with a homozygous /dt/a-W402X mouse. Specific Aim #2: Determine whether compounds that suppress premature stop mutations can restore significant a-L-iduronidase activity in a homozygous ldua-\N4Q2X mouse. Specific Aim #3: Examine the relationship between NMD and suppression of the /dua-W402X mutation."
2993,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that nanofibrous/nanostructured PTFE prepared by a novel jet-blowing process will exhibit useful biomedical properties, especially for cardiovascular applications such as vascular grafts.  A fundamental question to be answered in this study is whether nanoarchitecture at the same length scale as proteins will lead beneficial medical outcomes thus far inaccessible to conventional surface modification strategies. To answer this question we have formulated the following working hypotheses: (1) Because of the unique nanotopography/nanomorphology of polytetrafluoroethylene formed during the jet-blowing process, platelets will not adhere and become activated and anchorage-dependent mammalian cells such as endothelial cells will not adhere to these unmodified surfaces. (2) The surface of nanofibrous/nanostructured PTFE and related composites may be engineered/chemically functionalized to permit the selective adhesion of target cell types (e.g. endothelial cells) and development of appropriate phenotypic behavior.  To test these hypotheses, the proposed research is divided into three specific aims directed toward the goal of developing unique nanostructured PTFE materials and composites capable of preventing the biofouling of medical devices. Because of the complex host-material interactions involved in vascular graft design, we will focus our efforts here on the study of endothelial cell proliferation on these materials since complete endothelialization of the lumen surface of a graft is highly desired. Issues related to in vivo platelet adhesion, complement activation, thrombogenesis, emboli formation will be the subject of future proposals (using the data gathered from this R21 as preliminary data). The research proposed here is of high risk, with little medical preliminary data describing the performance of these nanomaterials in cardiovascular applications. However, these nanomaterials may possess unique biomaterials properties resulting from their nanomorphology and designed surface functionalization and thus the reward may be high.  This research will lead to improved medical devices, especially for treatment of cardiovascular disease."
2994,HHS,HHS,"This grant will investigate the pro-inflammatory feedback reaction that develops between interleukin (IL)-4(and other cytokines) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) that leads to the inflammation, hyperplasia, andairway remodeling observed in chronic hyperplastic eosinophilic sinusitis (CHES) and asprin-exacerbatedrespiratory disease (AERD). AERD is a syndrome characterized by severe persistent asthma, aggressiveairway remodeling, extensive hyperplastic eosinophilic sinusitis with nasal polyp (NP) formation, andintolerance to aspirin. Eosinophils are essential to the fibrotic processes associated with asthma and CHES.Aspirin intolerance reflects increased expression of leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) and CysLT receptorexpression and, as a result, these subjects have constitutive overproduction and heightened responsivenessto CysLTs. CysLTs function through their ability to interact with two homologous receptors: CysLTI andCysLT2 both of which are highly upregulated in AERD. We hypothesize that CysLTs contribute to thehyperplasia, fibrosis, and remodeling of AERD through their activation of eosinophils. Both the pathwayresponsible for CysLT synthesis and the expression of CysLT receptors are tightly regulated by cytokines,including prominently, IL-4. This pro-inflammatory feedback between CysLTs and IL-4 promotes eosinophil-mediated inflammation, mucus gland secretion, and the proliferation of airway smooth muscle, epithelium,and endothelium, leading to fibrosis. In specific aim #1 we will dissect individual roles for CysLTI andCysLT2 receptors in these processes. Our hypothesis is that whereas the CysLTI receptor may be uniquelyinvolved in bronchospasm, the upregulation of CysLT2 receptor-dependent pathways has more importantremodeling functions in CHES/AERD. Specific aim #2 will investigate the regulation of CysLT receptors andLTC4S expression by IL-4. Finally, aspirin desensitization is an effective treatment for AERD. Thereforespecific aim #3 will investigate the role of IL-4 antagonism by aspirin as the therapeutic basis for the efficacyof this procedure"
3026,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypoxia is known to confer resistance of cancer cells to radio- and chemo-therapies leading to treatment failure. Our long-range goal is to induce apoptosis of hypoxic cancer cells through targeting the molecules that confer such a resistance. SAG (Sensitive to Apoptosis Gene) or ROC2/Rbx2 is a cysteine-rich antioxidant protein and a RING component of SCF (skp1, Cullins, F-box proteins) and possibly VCB (VHL-Cul2-Elongin B and C) E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that SAG is induced under hypoxia and when over-expressed, inhibits hypoxiainduced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. SAG also binds to caspase 3 and promotes caspase 3 ubiquitination when complexed with SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. The objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanism of SAG induction and apoptosis protection under hypoxia. The central hypothesis is that hypoxia induces HIF-1 which transactivates SAG expression through a direct binding to its consensus elements in the SAG promoter. Hypoxia also induces activity of protein kinase CKII which activates SAG via phosphorylation. Upon its induction and activation, SAG complexes with other components of SCF and VCB E3 ubiquitin ligases to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of caspase 3 and HIF-1alpha, respectively. Targeted caspase 3 degradation blocks caspase-dependent apoptosis, whereas targeted HIF-1alpha degradation prevents HIF-1alpha induced apoptosis through p53 stabilization. The rationale for the proposed research is to identify and characterize SAG and CKII as novel hypoxic cancer targets with ultimate goal in pharmaceutical intervention through their inhibition to sensitize hypoxic cancer cells to current cancer therapies. Specific aims to test the hypothesis are 1) to elucidate the mechanism of SAG induction through HIF-1alpha transcriptional activation under hypoxia, 2) to elucidate the mechanism by which SAG protects against apoptosis in manners of ligase independence (scavenging reactive oxygen species) and ligase dependence (caspase 3 and HIF-1alpha ubiquitination and degradation), 3) to determine the sensitization of hypoxic cancer cells to radio-therapy through targeting SAG and CKII, and 4) to differentiate SAG from ROC1/Rbx1 in their stress responses. Through this proposed research, we will  demonstrate, for the first time, a feedback loop between SAG and HIF-1alpha and reveal a mechanism by which SAG inhibits apoptosis under hypoxia via promoting the ubiquitination/degradation of caspase 3 and HIF-1alpha. We will also demonstrate a radio-sensitizing effect achieved by SAG silencing and CKII inhibition and provide a molecular basis for future discovery of novel radio-sensitizers through targeting SAG, or SAG-associated E3 ligases, and/or CKII kinase."
3042,HHS,HHS,"Objective: The objective of this proposal is to clarify the molecular mechanisms that regulate the pro-apoptotic effects of NRAGE in neural development, and to utilize this information in the future to designmodulators of NRAGE function as indirect regulators of caspase activity and cell viability.Hypothesis: The basis of this proposal is that NRAGE functions as an indispensable component of thenon-canonical Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)-signaling pathway leading to p38MAPK and caspaseactivation. This may be the same that mediates the tumor death of human medulloblastoma patientsundergoing retinoid therapy. New preliminary evidence demonstrates that the unique hexapeptiderepeat of NRAGE is essential in mediating cortical progenitor apoptosis, the cells that underliemedulloblastoma formation. In addition this region binds the inhibitor of apoptosis protein Xiap. Itstands to reason that discerning and altering this interaction will have great potential in regulatingcaspase activation and cell viability. In order to refine the role of NRAGE in neural progenitor apoptosis,we propose the following two Specific Aims:I. Elucidate the role of NRAGE in the non-canonical BMP signaling cascade resulting in BMP-induced p38MAPK activation and apoptosis of neural progenitors. A molecular dissection of the non-canonical BMP-signaling pathway will be undertaken to ascertain the role of NRAGE in neuralprogenitor apoptosis with emphasis on the formation of the TAK-TAB-NRAGE-XIAP complex needed toregulate non-canonical BMP signaling.II. Determine the role of canonical BMP signaling in regulating NRAGE protein expression.NRAGE expression and BMP-mediated apoptosis will be challenged in mice with abrogated canonicalBMP signaling due to a conditional mutation in the Smad4 gene in neural progenitors.We suggest that the proposed studies will clarify the function of NRAGE, and thus will have broadsignificance to the neuroscience community. Also, the identification and manipulation of NRAGE: Xiapinteractions may enhance the utility of NRAGE as a therapeutic target in manipulating caspaseactivity to combat a variety of human diseases, especially medulloblastoma."
3046,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This is a competing renewal application for a Senior Scientist Award (K0-5) to continue research on the biological and behavioral aspects of substance abuse. The proposed research is based on several grant awards currently funded by NIDA, NIH. I am Principal Investigator on four awards: (1) a Program Project designed to evaluate new strategies for cocaine treatment medications in basic preclinical and clinical studies; (2) an R01 award for preclinical studies of the interactions between cocaine and opioid drugs with different receptor selectivities; (3) an R01 award to study the influence of gonadal steroid hormones on the reinforcing and discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine and (4) a contract concerned with the assessment of potential treatment medications in rhesus monkeys. In addition, I am co-investigator on an R01 award designed to evaluate the analgesic and abuse-related effects of delta opioids; an R01 award concerned with the synthesis and evaluation of mixed action kappa/mu opioids and a contract to assess potential cocaine treatment medications in rats. I am also co-investigator on a NIDA training grant and responsible for mentoring young scientists.    Many of these multidisciplinary clinical and pre-clinical studies are concerned with the neurobiology of cocaine abuse from an endocrine perspective. The influence of gonadal steroid hormones on the reinforcing and discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine is being studied in non-human primates. The temporal pattern of cocaine's acute effects on anterior pituitary, gonadal and adrenal hormones is being examined in men and women, and in non-human primates. We hypothesize that the rapid co-modulatory interactions between cocaine and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal and adrenal axes may contribute to cocaine's abuse-related effects and could suggest new approaches to treatment. The effects of mu, kappa and delta opioids on cocaine self-administration are being evaluated in preclinical behavioral pharmacology studies. In related studies, the effects of dopaminergic and opioid drug combinations on the abuse-related effects of cocaine and heroin  speedballs  are being evaluated. We hypothesize that medication combinations will be more effective in decreasing  speedball  abuse than single medications alone.    Proposed plans for professional growth include continued study of endocrinology, brain imaging and computer science as well as study of two new directions in our research program that involve collaborative studies in medicinal chemistry and immunology."
3075,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of bloodstream infections caused by Candida species has increased dramatically; these organisms now account for 10% of all bloodstream isolates. The mortality associated with candidemia approaches 40%, even with therapy. Because of this unacceptably high mortality, new strategies to treat and prevent this infection are necessary. Our goal is to identify new Candida albicans virulence genes and to determine the mechanisms by which they contribute to pathogenicity. This information holds promise to identify new targets for antifungal strategies. Our hypothesis is that the ability of C. albicans to invade and damage host cells is critical for the organism to establish and maintain a deep-seated infection. Support for this hypothesis comes from our finding that many C. albicans mutants with decreased virulence in the mouse model of hematogenously disseminated infection also have reduced ability to invade and damage endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, we have screened a collection of random C. albicans homozygous insertion mutants to identify strains with impaired capacity to damage endothelial cells in vitro. We discovered that zed1/zed1 and cka2/cka2 insertion mutants caused much less endothelial cell damage than did the isogenic control strain. Also, the zed1/zed1 insertion mutant had significantly attenuated virulence in mice (the virulence of the cka2/cka2 strain has not yet been tested). These results strongly suggest that C. albicans genes required for in vitro endothelial cell damage are also required for virulence. Our objective is to use in vitro studies of the interactions between C. albicans and endothelial cells to define mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction. In this project, we will 1) identify the endothelial cell receptors that C. albicans uses to invade this host cell; 2) determine the mechanisms by which C. albicans Zed1p, Cka2p, and other newly identified gene products contribute to virulence; 3) use defined C. albicans mutants to elucidate functional relationships among C. albicans virulence regulators, endothelial cell receptors, and endothelial cell damage; and 4) use a random insertional mutagenesis approach to identify new C. albicans genes that promote endothelial cell damage in vitro and virulence."
3094,HHS,NSF,"Chronic pain is a serious health problem that has remained largely refractory to therapeutic intervention. The development of new pain therapeutics would be aided by a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating nociception. The Mas-related genes (Mrgs) are a recently discovered, large family of G-protein coupled neuropeptide receptors (GPCRs) that are expressed with exquisite specificity in highly restricted subsets of nociceptive sensory neurons. The goal of this Program Project gram is to mount a concerted, interdisciplinary effort to understand the molecular function of differem Mrgs, the function of theneurons that express them, and the nature of the circuits in which these neurons participate. The project integrates the efforts of three laboratories with complementary expertise. The laboratory of David Anderson, which discovered the Mrgs, will utilize state-of-the art methods of mouse molecular genetics to generate and analyze strains of mice in which different Mrg genes have been deleted, and in which Mrg-expressing neurons can be inducibly ablated or silenced, or their second- and higher-order projections traced. These mice can also be used to prospectively identify Mrg-expressing neurons for physiological and molecular genetic analyses.The laboratory of Allan Basbaum is experienced in the behavioral, neuroanatomical, physiological and pharmacological analysis of nociception, and will collaborate with Anderson's group to thoroughly characterize the phenotypes of mice lacking different Mrg genes, or Mrg-expressing neurons, as well as in the analysis of Mrg synaptic connectivity. Because all Mrg-expressing cells are contained within the IB4-positive subset of nociceptive neurons, this project dovetails with the Basbaum laboratory's ongoing interest in understanding the function of this subpopulation in pain. The laboratory of Melvin Simon has expertise in the molecular genetic analysis of signal transduction by GPCRs and G-proteins. They will apply this expertise tocharacterize the pharmacology and mechanism of action of Mrgs, as well as to identify both endogenous and surrogate ligands for these receptors. In vitro culture of Mrg-expressing neurons will be employed to analyze and mechanistically dissect the influence of different candidate Mrg ligands, and idemify components of the intracellular signaling circuit. These studies may eventually lead to novel Mrg-based therapeutics for the treatment of pain in humans."

3118,HHS,HHS,"The results obtained so far with Ae. aegypti represent the first dynamic approach to determining the fate ofamino acids from meal proteins in mosquitoes. Using the methods developed during the last grant period, weare now in a position to probe the metabolic control of amino acid metabolism in more detail and to begin ananalysis of metabolic fuel accretion during larval development, as well as, applying these methods to othermosquitoes, such as Culex pipens. The ultimate aim of this project is to define blood meal protein amino acidmetabolism in the context of the whole mosquito and to understand, in quantitative terms, how the differentmetabolic fluxes simultaneously support the gonotrophic cycle after a blood meal and the survival of thefemale mosquito, because unless she survives the first gonotrophic cycle there would be no opportunity totake a second blood meal and transmit disease. Such an analysis offers a unique opportunity to identify newand unexpected targets for mosquito control. The following specific aims are proposed for the next grant period:Aim 1 Investigate the metabolic fates of blood meal amino acids in Ae. aegypti females. ¿ How is the mosquito able to selectively alter the metabolic fate of different amino acids? ¿ What are the metabolic fates of proline, the major hemolymph amino acid, during blood meal digestion? ¿ How does the metabolism of ammonia released from amino acid oxidation change during a gonotrophic cycle?Aim 2 Develop quantitative models that accurately describe metabolic flux in Ae. aegypti females. ¿ What model best describes the time course for amino acid metabolism during the gonotrophic cycle? ¿ Howcan similar quantitative models be applied to understanding whole mosquito metabolism?Aim 3 Investigate the dynamics of metabolic flux during development in Ae. aegypti. ¿ How is the metabolism of larvae integrated to ensure the synthesis of energy reserves?Aim 4 Determine metabolic changes that occur in specific tissues ofAe. aegypti females. ¿ What is the extent of protein turnover under different metabolic conditions? ¿ Howdoes the metabolism of the fat body and midgut change during the gonotrophic cycle?Aim 5 Investigate the dynamics of metabolic flux during diapause in C.pipiens. ¿ Howdoes diapause alter sugar metabolism in C.pipiens? ¿ What is the fate of reserves during diapause in C.pipiens?"
3129,HHS,HHS,"Podocyte depletion is a hallmark of progressive glomerulosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy. CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is a widely-expressed cytoplasmic adaptor protein that has previously beenimplicated in podocyte slit diaphragm protein complex formation. CD2AP null mice develop progressiveglomerulosclerosis early in life and CD2AP haploinsufficiency is associated with glomerular diseasesusceptibility in humans. However, it remains unclear how loss of CD2AP function may causeglomerulosclerosis. In this renewal application, we will extend our work to test the hypothesis that CD2APpromotes renal epithelial cell survival by functioning as a molecular switch that suppresses the TGF-betareceptor type I (Tgfbr1)/Smad3-dependent apoptosis pathway and activates a Tgfbrl/phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) -dependent survival pathway. If confirmed, our studies will provide a molecular mechanism toexplain how loss of CD2AP may enhance podocyte apoptosis and depletion to promote glomerular diseasein mice and men based on a novel, essential functional role for CD2AP as multi-pathway regulator in TbRI-induced signal transduction. The relevance of this work is further underscored by recent observationssuggesting that in the absence of direct genetic defects, functional downregulation of CD2AP expression is acommon finding in mouse models and human glomerular disease.Specific Aims: 1. Identify the molecular determinants and characterize the regulation of the TGF-p-inducibleinteraction of CD2AP and cytoplasmic Tgfbrl. We will a) determine the sequence motif and structural modelof Tgfbrl that underlies the interaction with CD2AP, and b) compare it with the Smad-binding modelmediated by the GS region and L45 loop of Tgfbrl. 2. Investigate how CD2AP mediates negative regulationof Tgfbr1/Smad3 signaling. We will examine whether a) CD2AP competes with SmadS for binding toactivated Tgfbrl; and b) CD2AP targets internalized Tgfbrl complexes for degradation and termination ofsignaling. 3. Define the role of podocyte-specific TGF-b receptor signaling in podocyte apoptosis anddepletion in vivo, and determine whether this podocyte-specific mechanism underlies the progression ofglomerular injury to glomerulosclerosis in CD2AP-/- mice? We will determine in vivo whether a) conditionaldeletion of TGF-b receptor type II (Tgfbr2) in podocytes using cre/lox technology prevents podocyteapoptosis, depletion, and/or glomerulosclerosis in CD2AP-/- mice; and b) whether podocyte-specific,controlled activation of TGF-(3 receptor signaling is sufficient to induce podocyte apoptosis, podocytedepletion and glomerulosclerosis in vivo using doxycycline-inducible expression of constitutively activeTgfbrl (Tgfbrl (AAD))."
3150,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The function of a cytokine called GIF or MIF has been unclear for a long time. However, recent studies have demonstrated that a posttranslational modification of this cytokine at C60 is required for the binding to the receptor and for the capability to inhibit B cell Ig switch, BCR-mediated antigen uptake, and IL-4 secretion from CD4 cells. GIF-/- mice displayed enhanced antibody responses to a T-dependent antigen regardless of Ig isotype but normal responses to a T-independent antigen. CD4 cells from GIF-/- mice differentiated toward a Th2 phenotype as compared with wild type cells. GIF receptor was undetectable in resting mouse T and B cells, but after in vitro stimulation the receptor was induced on these cells. GIF receptor appeared to be a 50-52 kDa cell surface protein. To determine whether the biological effects of GIF is mediated through the interaction of GIF and its receptor, anti-receptor mAb will be generated and the cDNA encoding the receptor will be cloned. To define the target cells for this cytokine, the expression of the receptor will be delineated using cells and mRNA samples from various hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tissues. To clarify the role of GIF in regulating B cell activation in T-B collaboration, HEL-specific B cells from MD4 BCR Tg mice and Ova-specific CD4 cells from DO11.10 TCR Tg mice, either on GIF+/+ or -/- background, will be stimulated in vitro with HEL-Ova conjugate. The secretion of GIF, the induction of its receptor, and the events associated with B cell activation will be analyzed in the course of the cognate T-B interaction. The effects of GIF on BCR-dependent antigen uptake, trafficking, and processing will be analyzed. To determine the role of GIF on cytokine production and Th differentiation of CD4 cells, the expression of GIF receptor and the secretion of GIF upon T cell activation will be analyzed. The source of GIF that regulates Th differentiation will be determined by adoptive transfer experiments using CD4 cells from GIF+/+ and -/- DO11.10 TCR Tg mice and bone marrow chimera constructions. The mechanism by which GIF inhibits Th2 differentiation and/or induces Th1 differentiation will be analyzed with regard to Stat phosphorylation and transcription factors. The role of GIF in regulating Th2-type inflammation will be evaluated in the mouse model of antigen-induced bronchial asthma. These experiments will establish the role of this cytokine in CD4 T cell-mediated immune responses."
3171,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Eight of the 17 FDA-approved antiretroviral drugs for treating HIV-1 infection are NRTI such as AZT. NRTI are 3'-hydroxyl lacking analogs of the dNTP substrates used by HIV-1 RT, thus when an NRTI is added to the 3'-end of the nascent DNA chain, viral DNA synthesis is terminated. HIV-1 resistance to AZT (and other NRTI including abacavir) is a serious therapeutic problem and arises from RT-catalyzed phosphorolytic excision of the incorporated NRTI. Excision is enhanced by specific mutations in RT termed TAMs (thymidine analog mutations). After excision of the incorporated NRTI, viral DNA synthesis can resume to complete viral replication. Specific inhibitors of NRTI excision would be therapeutically useful by preventing removal of incorporated NRTI, thereby restoring activity of NRTI such as AZT and abacavir against TAM containing HIV-1. Optimally, such inhibitors should not reduce incorporation of NRTI as this would obviously antagonize their antiretroviral activity. We hypothesize that selective inhibitors of NRTI excision can be identified because NRTI incorporation and excision reactions use different substrates and have different rate limiting steps. Our preliminary data show certain bisphosphonate compounds may have utility in this context. We therefore propose (1) To screen and characterize an existing library of bisphosphonates. This includes development of a rapid primer unblocking screening assay, and detailed biochemical and virological analyses of screening hits; (2) To optimize the potency of bisphosphonate inhibitors of NRTI excision. This includes molecular modeling to predict the optimal bisphosphonate analog pharmacophore, and crystallographic studies of selected bisphosphonate analogs bound to covalent binary complexes of RT - template/AZT-primer; (3) To synthesize and characterize new inhibitor analogs predicted from Aim 2.; (4) To evaluate approaches to improve cell uptake of bisphosphonates. These include the use of drug carriers and chemical modification of bisphosphonates to improve cell uptake and antiviral activity."
3206,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  More than 64% of US adults are overweight or obese, with nearly 31% (over 61 million) meeting criteria for obesity.  There is a clear link between obesity and the development of diabetes, heart disease, many cancers, and depression.  Defining the physiological mechanisms that control food intake thus provides direction in the search for pathogenic mechanisms of obesity and strategies for prevention and treatment of obesity-related diseases.  Peptide YY (PYY), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) comprise a family of structurally related brain-gut peptides with diverse actions mediated by four known receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5).  Endocrine cells of the distal gut provide a major source of PYY.  Food intake releases at least two forms of PYY into the circulation:  PYY(1-36) and PYY(3-36); other predicted/detected isoforms include PYY(1-36)-Gly, PYY(3-36)-Gly, [Ser13PO3]PYY(1-36), and [Ser13P03]PYY(3-36).  Systemic administration of PYY(3-36) potently inhibits food intake in rodents and humans; PYY(1-36) is 10-fold less potent in rats.  Obese humans appear to have a blunted plasma PYY response to food intake; yet, low doses of PYY(3-36) decrease food intake similarly in lean and obese humans.  Together, these results suggest that PYY(3-36) may act physiologically to reduce food intake and body adiposity, and that insufficient production of PYY(3-36) may promote obesity.  Studies will test the hypothesis that PYY(3-36) secreted by the gut in response to a meal acts as a hormonal signal to the brain to produce satiety and regulate energy reserves.  Rats with indwelling jugular vein, abdominal aortic, and/or gastric cannulae will be used to address the following specific aims:  1) Determine whether PYY(3-36), when infused iv, is the most potent and efficacious PYY isoform for reducing food intake.  2) Use selective Y-receptor agonists and antagonists to identify the Y-receptor subtype(s) that mediate anorexic responses to exogenous PYY isoform(s).  3) Determine whether anorexigenic PYY isoform(s) act synergistically with other putative satiety and body energy regulatory signals (CCK, amylin, GLP-1, leptin) to reduce food intake.  4) Determine whether body adiposity is reduced by daily, intermittent iv infusions of anorexigenic PYY isoform(s) when given alone and in combination with other PYY isoform(s), satiety peptides, and leptin.  5) Use novel proteomic methods to determine whether postprandial increases in plasma levels of PYY isoform(s), when reproduced by iv infusion, are sufficient to reduce food intake and body adiposity.  6) Determine whether circulating PYY isoform(s) act as essential blood-borne signals to the brain to reduce food intake, by investigating whether immuneutralization of circulating PYY increases food intake.  7) Use antagonists of PYY action (receptor antagonists and PYY antibodies) and abdominal vagal denervation to determine whether anorexigenic PYY isoform(s) act through control of vagal signaling to the brain to reduce food intake."
3217,HHS,NSF,"Bone marrow transplant is being used extensively in the treatment of acute and refractory malignancies.Both the patient and the family are impacted by the intensity of this therapy that requires extendedhospitalization, serious complications, life-threatening immunosuppression, and extensive recovery. Eachfamily member is acutely impacted by the emotional stress and the changes in the family system that resultfrom the transplant. This study will focus on 40 children of BMT recipients and the impact of the parent'stransplant within the context of the family system. A broad range of research, including studies of children ofcancer patients, has shown that children of ill parents exhibit psychosocial and emotional distress. However,adaptation has not been examined in children of BMT recipients who are exposed to prolonged separationfrom the parent, family disruption, and resulting changes in family structure and day-to-day routines. Thepurpose of this study is to examine the impact of three strategic variables on adaptation: the child'sperception of the impact of the cancer/BMT, the level of family cohesion, and family structural changes.These variables will be measured at 3 timepoints over the acute phase of the parent's BMT."
3230,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Normal regulation of insulin gene transcription by glucose is essential for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, and requires the beta-cell specific transcription factors Pdx-1, MafA and NeuroD1. However the exact mechanism(s) by which glucose increases insulin gene expression by modulating the function of these transcription factors remains unknown. We found that glucose regulates the DNA binding activity of Pdx-1 and that Pdx-1 is modified by acetylation. Furthermore, we discovered that glucose stimulates insulin gene transcription by causing hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin promoter via the recruitment of the histone acetylase p300 by Pdx-1. Modification of core histones by acetylation has been shown to alter gene expression, but the mechanisms that direct histone acetylation to specific gene promoters are not well understood. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that high blood glucose levels stimulate insulin gene transcription via modulation of histone H4 acetylation mediated by the beta-cell specific transcription factor Pdx-l. This hypothesis will be further investigated by addressing the following questions: 1) Is the glucose-regulated acetylation of Pdx-1 important for Pdx-1 activity and/or DNA binding? 2) What role do the histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP and GCN5/PCAF play in glucose regulation of insulin gene expression? 3) Do the beta-cell specific transcription factors MafA and NeuroD1 regulate insulin gene transcription by recruiting histone acetyltransferases?     Although, most of the experiments will be carried out using the mouse insulinoma MIN6 cell line, the key findings will be confirmed using primary rat islets. Recent data indicate that defects in histone acetylation are associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes. Several of the diabetes-causing mutations in the MODY genes HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha interfere with their interaction with histone acetylases. Patients with Huntington's disease are prone to type II diabetes due to decreased insulin gene expression caused by degradation of histone acetylases. Information on how high blood glucose levels regulate beta-cell specific gene expression in the pancreas will help to understand how defects in this process result in diabetes. In addition, the data obtained will contribute to our understanding of Pdx-1, MafA and NeuroD1 function in the regulation of pancreas development and glucose-stimulated insulin gene transcription."
3232,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main cause of age-related dementia, is increasing in prevalence due to the increasing number of elderly in our population. AD is associated with prominent impairments of neurons and synapses and with an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-B peptides (AB) in the brain. AB, which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), appears to play a causal role in AD, although it remains uncertain how it erodes cognitive functions and how this process can be prevented or reversed. The results we obtained during the preceding funding period have begun to shed light on these questions. We determined that human APP (hAPP) transgenic mice producing high levels of human Af5 in the brain have an AD-like pattern of synaptic alterations (previous Aim 1), that the enzyme Fyn is involved in some AB-dependent synaptic alterations (previous Aim 2), that premature mortality and neuronal deficits in hAPP mice can be prevented or delayed by the genetic modulation of Fyn or apolipoprotein E (previous Aim 3), and that the extent of cognitive deficits in hAPP mice is tightly linked to the neuronal depletion of factors that are regulated by excitatory synaptic activity (previous Aim 4). Some of these factors were also depleted in corresponding neuronal populations of humans with AD. These results provide a solid foundation for the current application and underline that we are in a good position to advance this interesting area of research. Here we propose to determine how exactly hAPP/Abeta interacts with Fyn-related signaling cascades to cause neuronal impairments (new Aim 1), whether the pharmacogenetic inhibition of Fyn can prevent and reverse neuronal deficits in hAPP mice (new Aim 2), whether hAPP/Abeta-dependent neuronal alterations are caused by an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activities (new Aim 3), and whether the pharmacological or genetic manipulation of neurotransmitter receptors or Fyn-related signaling pathways can prevent and reverse behavioral deficits in hAPP mice (new Aim 4). This study could reveal how increased levels of AB impair important cognitive functions such as learning and memory. It could also resolve whether these impairments can be prevented or reversed by therapeutic manipulation of synaptic activity and neuronal signaling. Ultimately, our study may provide useful guidance in the development of drugs to maintain and improve memory and other cognitive functions in AD."
3247,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide health problem. It is estimated that there are 200 to 500 million HBV chronic carriers in the world for whom, to date, there is no reliable treatment. HBV causes both acute and chronic liver disease and the estimated relative risk of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) in chronic HBV carriers is approximately 100 times greater than in uninfected individuals. Therefore, effective treatments for chronic HBV infection are required. In cell culture, nuclear hormone receptors have been shown to be essential for HBV pregenomic RNA synthesis and viral biosynthesis. Using a HBV transgenic mouse model of chronic HBV infection, the potential critical role of the nuclear hormone receptors, HNF4 and RXRalpha plus PPARalpha, in regulating HBV transcription and replication in vivo will be investigated. If these nuclear hormone receptors are essential for viral biosynthesis in vivo, these ligand-dependent transcription factors should represent important targets for the development of antiviral agents. In addition, altering the level of expression of the HNF3 isoforms in cell culture and in vivo has been shown to inhibit HBV replication. The role of modulating cellular signal transduction pathways in determining the level of expression of the HNF3 isoforms in vivo and inhibiting HBV transcription and replication will be examined. Understanding the cellular targets of the signal transduction pathways that inhibit HBV synthesis should permit the rational design of antiviral agents. The transgenic mouse model of chronic HBV infection will be used to understand the role of transcriptional regulation in the generation and maintenance of HBV covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA in vivo. Inhibition of HBV CCC DNA synthesis is essential to viral clearance and the prevention of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in man. All of these studies are aimed at identifying possible targets for therapeutic intervention in HBV infection."
3265,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The abundance of GluR2 mRNA relative to other AMPA receptor subunit mRNAs is highly variable in many GABAergic interneurons, which endows them with a wide spectrum of AMPA receptor properties. GluR2 mRNA and protein levels decline following intense seizure activity or transient ischemia in certain vulnerable neuron populations before clear histological signs of cell damage, raising the possibility that larger synaptic currents or excess calcium entry through newly synthesized GluR2-deficient AMPA synaptic receptors contributes to the later phase of neuron damage. There is evidence for activity-dependent local dendritic translation of GluR2 mRNA, and for postsynaptic GluR2 translation following LTP stimuli. All of these findings indicate that the mechanisms responsible for moderate changes in GluR2 expression - developmentally, during synaptic plasticity, and after seizures or traumatic insult in the adult - are important neuronal regulatory controls governing synaptic phenotype. Work in the current project period has identified specific transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanisms operating on AMPA receptor genes. In the proposed work we intend to test the following hypotheses: i) that translational regulation of GluR2 mRNA requires one or more of the multiple conserved cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE) or polyadenylation response elements (PRE) resident in the 3'UTR; ii) that MAP kinase pathways exert dual control over translation of GluR2 transcripts; iii) that neuron-dependent transcriptional start site selection influences the form and extent of translational control by 5' and 3'UTR; and iv) that repression of GluR2 expression by seizures requires the RE1 silencer in the GluR2 promoter. Regulation of the physiological properties of glutamate receptor channels at the translational and transcriptional levels should be relevant to the late phase of LTP, learning, and the response to seizures, as well as other situations in which receptor phenotype is remodeled ."
3278,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission of a application developed in response to an RFA concerning studies of the comorbidity of depression with a disruptive behavior disorder (oppositional defiant disorder; ODD) in children and adolescents, a condition that is believed to be particularly resistant to treatment and a precursor to adolescent drug abuse. The first critique of the application led to revisions in data analytic procedures to allow for SEM analysis to examine the overall model more carefully. Incorporating recommendations from reviewers for this resubmission expands the model to incorporate a new variable (attention problems), improves certain measures, incorporates teacher observations, and reintroduces certain elements of the original application to examine subgroups of children with clinically significant levels of ODD and depression. Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is the most common psychiatric problem among young children; depression meeting DSM diagnostic criteria is uncommon in preschoolers, but depressive symptoms are not. In studies of depression and ODD among the entire age spectrum of childhood and adolescents, several family, maternal, and child characteristics, along with the mother-child interactional patterns have been identified as risk factors/correlates, with most characteristics seeming to be risk factors for both ODD and depression. While studies of the early origins of ODD exist, relatively few have examined onset of depressive symptoms in young children, and even fewer have examined the development of ODD/depression comorbidity. This proposed study will examine a model included family (conflict, stressors), maternal (depression), child (temperament, school academic competence, social skills problems, attentional problems), and interactional (mother-child interaction, temperament) variables that have received empirical support as precursors to the development of ODD and depression in a large (N=1615) group of children age 4-5 at study onset. Participants will be recruited from public schools and primary care pediatric practices and followed across 3 annual waves of data collection. Primarily using structured equation modeling techniques, overall model fit and the role of specific variables in he development of ODD, depression, and their comorbidity will be examined for both parent and teacher-rated outcomes; additional analyses will examine clinical subgroups."

3348,HHS,HHS,"Cytokine production by the Th1 and Th2 subsets have been associated with susceptiblity toinfectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases. Understanding the molecular events which controllineage-specific cytokine expression would provide useful tools to modulate the Th1/Th2 response. IL-4 production by Th2 cells is regulated by NFAT and the NFAT cofactor, NIP45. We have shown thatarginine methylation of NIP45 facilitates its interaction with NFAT and augments IL-4transcription.Our data positioned the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 downstream of the T cell receptor,suggesting that arginine methylation may be an important modification in immune receptor signalingpathways. Arginine methylation is countered by the actions of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4).The five PAD enzymes convert arginine residues within proteins into the atypical amino acid citrulline.PAD4 is expressed mainly in lymphocytes. We have found that NIP45 methylation is negativelyregulated by PAD4 via citrullination of arginine residues, which prevents the ability of NIP45 to bemethylated by PRMT1. PAD4 expression dramatically reduces NIP45-induced IL-4promoter activity.Therefore, we hypothesize that through actions on NIP45 and other regulatory proteins thatPAD4 controls Th cell cytokine expression.The specific aimsare: 1) Determine the mechanism by which PAD4 antagonizes NIP45-mediatedinduction of Th cell cytokine production. We will (i) determine the modified arginine residues in NIP45 by mass spectrometry, (ii) determine how PAD4 influences NIP45 activity by studying the effects of PAD4 on the NIP45/NFAT interaction, (iii) determine whether citrullination within NIP45 serves a function other than preventing methylation. 2) Investigate the regulation of PAD4 activity. We will: (i) determine the PAD4 expression pattern in Th cells, (ii) determine whether PAD4 activity is regulated in Th cells, (iii) determine whether PAD4, itself, is regulated by arginine methylation. 3) Analyzethe phenotype of PAD4 deficient mice. We will create mice in which exons 7-13 of PAD4 are flanked by loxP sites so that we can ablate PAD4 expression in the T lineage using CD4-Cre Tg mice. These mice will allow us to determine the role of PAD4 in Th cell function."
3359,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The detection and quantitative determination of particles is important in the areas of preventive and diagnostic medicine. The particles may be single eukaryotic cells with particular properties, bacteria, viruses, protein aggregates, or other molecular entities. We have built a prototype instrument that combines a novel fluorescence technique with filtration algorithms based on particle passage pattern recognition. It has allowed the detection of particles in turbid fluids down to a few per millimeter in short scanning times. This proposal has the Specific Aims of expanding this technology and applying it to the measurement and characterization of ultra-low abundance multimers of the Amyloid beta in clinical fluids. Oligomeric forms of this peptide are a potential molecular marker to quantify disease progression in Alzheimer's disease and to identify persons at risk for age-related cognitive change and dementia. This proposal also seeks to optimize sample treatment, instrumental parameters, data analysis and assay methods to rapidly quantify and determine the physical properties of the oligomers. The technology could potentially be extended to the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of other protein aggregation/misfolding neurologic diseases."
3370,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caveolin-1 is a negative regulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function. Indeed, caveolin-1 (-/-) mice exhibit enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxations in conduit vessels and exaggerated NO-dependent microvascular permeability in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We have shown that a cell-permeable, caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) attenuates endothelium-dependent relaxations, and reduces vascular permeability in vivo. With this background in mind, we hypothesize that understanding the atomic interactions between eNOS and caveolin-1 will permit molecular dissection of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of caveolin-1 as a negative regulator of eNOS. To examine the regulation of this important interaction in more detail, we will: Aim 1. Define the molecular interactions of eNOS with caveolin-1 at the atomic level. We will refine our structure of the CSD bound to eNOS and test the structural model using biophysical, biochemical and cell biological approaches. We will mutate key amino acid residues at the interface of eNOS and caveolin-1 and examine their effects on NOS activity and NO release; Aim 2. Develop new cell-permeable peptides fused to the CSD based on structural information and test their effects in vivo. In preliminary results, we show a cell permeable version of CSD stereospecifically blocks endothelium-dependent relaxations, acute changes in vascular permeability and tumor permeability and progression in vivo. Moreover, we have isolated a small fragment of CSD that exerts biological activity in cells; and Aim 3. Examine vascular function in transgenic mice that express mutant eNOS or caveolin-1. Based on structural information, we will define generate transgenic mice expressing wild-type or mutant CSD to directly test the molecular nature of this interaction. We will monitor systemic hemodynamics, vascular function, permeability, and tumor progression as physiological endpoints in these mice."
3387,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The basic  building blocks  of visual perception are starting to become reasonably well understood, and we can make a fairly good account of how simple discriminations are done. What we understand much less is how the visual system solves more realistic, everyday challenges. Visually guided navigation is a particularly good  model system  for studying real-world visual processes in the laboratory. The perception of self-motion from the pattern of motion on the retina has been studied extensively, though we still know very little about where in the brain the critical processing steps occur, and how the complex pattern of motion is converted into effective movement. The present proposal seeks to answer these open questions. First, we will seek direct evidence for the involvement of multiple cortical areas in the perception of self-motion, by using multiple, simultaneous recording techniques while our experimental animals are performing a discrimination of self-motion direction. Secondly, we will seek to ask if the parietal cortical area (the ventral intraparietal area or VIP) is both necessary for self-motion perception and is actually used. We will do this by perturbing the pattern of activity in VIP in the context of the self-motion task, both by reversible inactivation as well as by electrical activation. These complementary methods should greatly extend our understanding of how the parietal cortex participates in self-motion perception. However, to really extend our knowledge of self-motion perception, we need to extend the inquiry into a more active context. Human-factors studies have revealed that guidance of self-motion ( steering ) is a very active process, with the direction of gaze being a critical component. However, next to nothing is known about the central nervous system mechanisms used in this active task. So, we propose to establish, characterize and exploit an animal model of active locomotion to study the involvement of brain structures in this task. We will train our subject to direct their  virtual  trajectories by joystick, and characterize how their normal behavior is influenced by cues including target direction, gaze direction, gaze velocity, and visual motion information. We will then record activity in multiple cortical areas while animals are engaged in this task, and explore the signals in visual and parietal cortex to better understand brain mechanisms of visually guided navigation. This information, in the long term, might be useful in helping the disabled to navigate, and in the development of visual prosthetics for the blind."
3391,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of new therapies to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is often hindered by the poor bioavailability of candidate drugs to affected motor neurons within the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, while both glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have had robust survival promoting effects on injured motor neurons in experimental animals, their success in treating ALS patients appears to have been thwarted by insufficient access to motor neurons in the much larger human CNS. We hypothesize that genetic or chemical fusion of tetanus toxin fragment C (TTC) to either GDNF or IGF-1 will improve growth factor delivery to motor neurons through one or more mechanisms related to the nerve cell binding properties of TTC. The primary goal of this project, then, is to assess whether the neuroprotective activity of IGF-1:TTC and GDNF:TTC in an experimental animal model of ALS is superior to that of the respective growth factor alone. Our study has four specific aims: (1) optimize the design, expression, and purification of IGF-1:TTC and GDNF:TTC; (2) characterize the purity, stability, and basic functional activity of these fusion proteins; (3) examine the bioavailability and functional activity of the fusion proteins in rodent CNS following intracerebroventricular or intramuscular administration; and (4) investigate the neuroprotective activity of the fusion proteins in a transgenic rat model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The experiments in Aim 1 will use recombinant protein expression and purification techniques to generate the fusion proteins, while the studies in Aims 2 and 3 will employ immunocytochemical, Western blot, enzyme immunoassay, and morphometric techniques to assess the functional properties of GDNF:TTC and IGF-1:TTC in cultured ceils and whole animals. Finally, the experiments in Aim 4 will employ transgenic animals in survival and behavioral experiments to assess the neuroprotective effects of GDNF:TTC and/or IGF-1 :TTC in vivo. While the present work may give rise to a new treatment for ALS, the information obtained from our characterization of IGF-1:TTC and GDNF:TTC may lead to the use of these fusion proteins in other neurological disorders as well."
3396,HHS,NSF,"Protein kinase B/Akt is a serine-threonine kinase which acts downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) and is induced by many endogenous ligands such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, steroidhormones, and statins. Phosphorylation of Akt leads to modulation of a variety of signal pathways withpotential cardiovascular protective effects including inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3b,activation of glucose transporter (Glut)-4, and inhibition of caspase-9. However, the role of endothelial Akt invasculary injury and atherosclerosis is not known. In endothelial cells, recent studies have focused on theactivation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by Akt. Endothelial NOS is a substrate for Akt, whichphosphorylates eNOS at Ser 1179, leading to increased eNOS activity and NO production. Endothelium-derived NO is cardiovascularly protective due to its vasodilating, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidativeproperties. Stimulation of eNOS via Akt in endothelial cells, therefore, may be a promising target forattenuating atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation. Although Akt could potentially play a critical role in vascular homeostasis, not much is knownregarding the contribution of endothelial Akt in vascular disease. This limitation is mostly due to the lack ofpharmacological tools available for a tissue-specific modulation of Akt.Consequently, a genetic approachusing tissue-restricted targeted gene disruption or modulation is more likely to elucidate the specific functionof Akt in the endothelium. For this purpose, we have developed transgenic mice overexpressingconstitutively-active or dominant-negative mutants of Akt, which could be inducibly targeted to theendothelium using the Cre/loxP system. Three specific aims are proposed, which will study the role ofendothelial Akt in models of vascular injury and atherosclerosis."
3490,HHS,NSF,"The theme of this project is to understand how complexes of proteins within the blood clotting cascadeassemble on membrane surfaces and how this assembly process regulates enzymatic activity. Theproposed studies focus on assembly of the cell-surface complex that triggers blood clotting, consisting ofthe regulatory protein, tissue factor, and its cognate serine protease, factor Vila; and investigating themechanism of action of novel regulators of blood clotting that we have recently discovered. Specifically, wewill investigate the following research questions: (1) How does membrane topography contribute to tissuefactor function? These studies will examine the consequences of altering the membrane topography oftissue factor on the proteolytic activity of the tissue factor-factor Vila complex. Included is an investigationof a novel way of attaching the extracellular domain of tissue factor (sTF) to membrane surfaces employingoligohistidine-tagged sTF and metal ion-chelating lipids. (2) How does polyphosphate modulate the bloodclotting cascade? We discovered that polyphosphate, an ancient molecule that is abundant in many microorganisms, and newly discovered in dense granules of human platelets, is a potent modulator of bloodclotting and fibrinolysis. We will examine: (a) platelet secretion of polyphosphate, including studies comparing normal platelets and platelets from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome; (b) the ability ofpolyphosphate to stimulate the contact pathway of blood clotting; (c) the mechanism by which polyphosphate completely abrogates the anticoagulant function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI); (d) how polyphosphate modulates thrombin function; and (e) how expression of polyphosphate in bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) modulates the blood clotting and fibrinolytic cascades. These studies are aimed at understanding how newly discovered modulators of the blood clotting system contribute to normal hemostasis and to the activation of the blood clotting system in human disease."
3502,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A healthy intestinal epithelium requires tight coordination of cell proliferation and apoptosis to maintain intact barrier and digestive functions, environmental sampling and immunoregulatory control. Previous work from our laboratory has identified kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) as an essential mediator of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-initiated signaling pathways in this tissue. In fact, without KSR kinase activity, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) exposed to pathological levels of TNF undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings indicate that KSR is required for TNF stimulation of extracellular-regulated-kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2), nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and Akt/protein kinase B. Taken together, these data position KSR as a key regulator of cytokine-mediated cell survival. The goal of this proposal is to test our hypothesis that KSR kinase activity regulates IEC survival during the inflammatory response through activation of anti-apoptotic signal transduction pathways. Supporting a role for KSR function in injury and repair in vivo, we have preliminary data that the KSR+/-IL - 10+/- mouse spontaneously develops inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with increased apoptosis of colon epithelial cells. Therefore, Aim 1 is designed to determine the mechanisms regulating KSR activation through mutagenesis, tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and in vitro ceramide activation studies. For this Aim, we have developed a novel KSR -/- mouse colon epithelial cell line which will greatly facilitate structure-function analyses. The focus of Aim 2 is to identify substrates and downstream targets of KSR in IECs through in vitro kinase assays, mutational analysis, co-precipitation assays and screening of Cdna expression libraries. In Aim 3 we will study the biological role of KSR in intestinal epithelial injury in vivo using animal models of TNF-induced enteropathy and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because TNF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of gastrointestinal diseases including IBD, necrotizing enterocolitis, celiac disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy, these studies have implications for a number of intestinal conditions resulting from altered programs of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Further, they will determine if KSR is a potential therapeutic target for gastrointestinal inflammation."
3554,HHS,HHS,"Gene expression in normal and pathological conditions is mediated by RNA polymeraseenzymes, a family of complex, multisubunit molecular machines that is highlyconserved in evolution. RNA polymerase function is controlled not only at the level ofaccess to genes (transcription initiation), but also during enzyme progression as RNAPcarries out its sequential readout of the gene message. An important example of suchcontrol occurs in HIV virus and is mediated by its major regulator, the TAT gene. Thecentral models for understanding enzymatic mechanisms involved in transcriptionalregulation are the antitermination proteins of the E. coli bacteriophage lambda, theproducts of its genes Q and N. This project studies the mechanism of action of the geneQ protein, which modifies RNA polymerase near its initiation site, but then becomes asubunit of the enzyme, allowing it to elongate more efficiently and to progress throughtranscription termination signals. We will discover important elements of both the Qpolypeptide and the subunits of RNA polymerase that are required for their physical andfunctional interaction, particularly the sigma initiation factor which mediates the initialengagement of Q protein with RNA polymerase, and we will study the altered enzymaticproperties of Q-modified RNA polymerase. We will investigate the mechanism oftranscription termination and the manner in which regulatory proteins interfere withthis process."
3572,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of these studies is to understand the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling system in health and disease. Regulation of endothelial NO production is a key determinant of blood pressure, platelet aggregation, and angiogenesis. The fundamental hypothesis of this research program is that eNOS post-translational modifications and protein-protein associations are essential determinants of NO-dependent signaling in the vascular wall. During the previous funding period, we investigated the relationships between eNOS subcellular targeting, acylation, and enzyme site-specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation; identified novel kinase and phosphatase pathways involved in eNOS regulation; explored the inter-relationships of VEGF and sphingosine 1- phosphate (S1P) signaling pathways in eNOS regulation; developed and exploited siRNA-based methods to explore the role of caveolin in modulation of endothelial signal transduction; identified a key role for the small G protein Rac1 in control of kinase pathways that modulate eNOS; and discovered that eNOS undergoes reversible receptor-modulated S-nitrosylation. These discoveries set the stage for the proposed studies, which are organized into two Specific Aims. Aim 1 proposes studies to explore the hypothesis that nitrosylation of eNOS inhibits its enzyme activity. We will examine the relationships between cellular redox state and eNOS nitrosylation in cultured endothelial cells, and will determine the mechanisms whereby eNOS phosphorylation and subcellular targeting influence eNOS nitrosylation and denitrosylation. The proposed studies will generate and characterize transgenic mice that express the nitrosylation-deficient eNOS mutant to test the hypothesis that eNOS nitrosylation serves to mitigate excessive NO generation in the vessel wall. Studies proposed in Aim 2 will identify the mechanisms of Rac1 activation by cell surface receptors in endothelial cells, and will determine the molecular basis for Rac1 inhibition by caveolin. These studies will explore the effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on caveolin-Rac1 signaling in the endothelium, and will identify the roles of Rac1 in NADPH oxidase vs. PI3-kinase activation in responses to VEGF and S1P. Our studies of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate eNOS may lead to the identification of new points for pharmacological intervention."
3582,HHS,HHS,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are attractive vehicle so far targeting radiation to tumors because of their ability to react specifically with molecular determinants that are either uniquely expressed or over expressed on cancer cells. However, the clinical impact of labeled mAb is hampered by loss of the label from the mAb in vivo and uptake of radioactivity in normal tissues. The goal of this research proposal is to develop more effective approaches for labeling mAbs with radioiodine nuclides and 211At. Iodine-131 is the most frequently used radionuclide in clinical radioimmunotherapy, but its usefulness has been compromised by in vivo dehalogenation of mAbs labeled via conventional methods. Astatine-21 1 emits a-particles that have a higher radiobiological effectiveness and shorter range than P-particles and, for certain therapeutic applications, may be .better matched to the characteristics of the tumor. We have focused our research on mAbs reactive with the epidermal growth factor receptor variant I11 (EGFRvIII) because this mutant receptor is present in high concentrations on glioma, breast carcinomas and other tumors, but is not found on normal tissues including those expressing wild type EGFR. Anti-EGFRvIII mAbs are internalized and processed rapidly, resulting in rapid loss of the label from tumor cells when mAbs are labeled by conventional approaches. Our hypothesis is that optimized labeling methods for internalizing mAbs such as anti-EGFRvIII will enhance tumor retention and tumor-to-noise seal ratios, thereby improving their clinical potential as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. The original specific aim Years 14-18 are: 1) To label anti-EGFRvIII mAbs with radioiodine nuclides and 211Auts ing N-succinimidyl 5-['311]iodo-3- pyridinecarboxylate and N-succinimidyl 5-[211At]astato-3-pyridinecarboxylate and to evaluate their potential as diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. 2) To investigate other strategies for labeling internalizing mAbs with radioiodine and including the use of alternate positively charged templates, D-amino acid linkers, and new approaches involving oligosaccharide conjugation; and 3)To investigate the nature of the high and low molecular weight labeled catabolites generated in tumor cells in vitro and tumor and normal tissues in vivo and use these data as a guide for developing improved methods for labeling mAbs."
3613,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In humans, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous bronchodilator, is depleted in the airway of asthmatics. GSNO reductase (GSNOR), an enzyme widely expressed across tissues including lung, regulates levels of lung GSNO levels. Wild-type mice develop increased GSNOR activity and decreased lung S-nitrosothiol (SNO) concentration following allergen challenge and suffer from increased airway hypersensitivity. In contrast, mice with a genetic deletion of GSNOR have increased lung SNO levels after allergen challenge and are protected from airway hyperreactivity. GSNOR deficient mice also have lower basal bronchial tone than normal animals and do not desensitize after repeated stimulation with (2 agonist therapy suggesting that endogenous SNOs regulate smooth muscle tone. These results provide genetic evidence in mice that dynamic SNO turnover is a critical mechanism of NO function in health and disease. In this grant application, we will test the hypothesis that depletion of the endogenous bronchodilator, GSNO, from the airway increases airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine and decreases response to inhaled (2 agonists in human asthma. We will first determine if GSNOR activity is increased in human asthma and correlates with airway SNO expression (Aim 1). We will next determine if GSNOR activity predicts responsiveness to inhaled ((2 agonist therapy and if the presence of polymorphisms of GSNOR predicts enzyme activity, airway SNO concentration, and response to (2 agonists in asthmatic as compared to control subjects (Aim 2). Finally, we plan to determine whether repletion of SNO in subjects with mild asthma confers protection against methacholine induced bronchoconstriction and desensitization to an inhaled (2 agonist (Aim 3). This proposal will further our understanding of GSNOR and SNOs in asthma, how they function as homeostatic agents in asthma, and how repletion of SNO provides a novel therapeutic target."
3619,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental question in development is how cells are specified. Elucidating mechanisms of cell-type specification is essential to the understanding and eventually treating human diseases, such as cancer, where this process is altered. One mechanism that specifies cell type is Asymmetric Cell Division, where a cell divides to produce two daughter cells that adopt distinct fates. Both intracellular asymmetric molecules and cell signaling appear to polarize neuroblasts, but a connection between the two mechanisms has been lacking. We have found that signaling is essential for certain asymmetric divisions that produce apoptotic cells and neural precursors and have identified molecules that are asymmetrically distributed in these divisions. The overall goal of our research is to understand how both cell intrinsic mechanisms and signaling regulate the fates of the neurons that are generated during these divisions. The proposal has three aims. 1) We propose to determine how the cytohesin GRP-1 regulates asymmetric cell divisions. Our model proposes that GRP-1 functions in V5 to regulate signaling between V5 and asymmetrically dividing neuroblasts, and we will test this idea rigorously for several divisions that require GRP-1 function. We will test the model that PI3K regulates GRP-1 and mediates its effects though ARF-1 and ARF-6. GRP-1's surprising localization to the nucleus raises the interesting possibility that cytohesins may function there, and we will ask whether GRP-1 carries out its functions in the nucleus. Finally, we will pursue RNG-1 and CNT-2, two molecules that may function in the GRP-1 pathway. 2) We propose to determine how Wnts regulate asymmetric divisions of the Q neuroblast, which also require both PIG-1 and GRP-1 function. Our preliminary experiments indicate that three Wnts and two Frizzled receptors are involved in these divisions. We will test the roles of the remaining Wnts and Wnt receptors, characterize the effects of these mutations on the divisions in more detail and test whether Wnt signaling acts in the GRP-1 or PIG-1 pathways. 3) Our analysis of GRP-1 and Wnt signaling indicates that cell signaling regulates asymmetric cell divisions. We will continue our EMS screens and begin RNAi screens to identify molecules that function in these signaling events, as well as molecules that act with HAM-1 and PIG-1."
3632,HHS,HHS,"The primary objective of this project is to understand the signaling mechanism of lightactivated sensory rhodopsins (SRs), part of the growing family of 7-helix transmembranemicrobial rhodopsins. The focus of this research will be on two key microbial rhodopsins,sensory rhodopsins I (SRI) and sensory rhodopsin II (SRII). In contrast tobacteriorhodopsin (BR), the well-studied light-driven proton pump, these SRs function bytransmitting a signal to an associated transducer protein, analogous to the well-known G-proteins in the rhodopsin signaling cascade. Detailed knowledge at the molecular level ofthe signaling mechanisms of SRs would be of great significance for understanding avariety of membrane protein-based cellular processes as well as have applications in thefield of biotechnology and biomedicine.In the case of SRII from Natronobacterium pharaonis, the high-resolution structure ofthe receptor linked to the transmembrane part of its cognate HtrII transducer has revealedimportant molecular details of the proteinprotein interactions, including the contactresidues and internal water molecules located in the interface region. However, so far X-ray diffraction has not revealed the molecular events connecting the initial light-inducedisomerization of the retinal chromophore to the activation of the transducer, possibly dueto structural constraints imposed by the crystal lattice. In the case of SRII, whichmediates a two-color repellent and attractant response, even less information is knowndue to difficulties of crystallization and expression. In addition, our own and other studiesdemonstrate the importance of studying SRs under physiological conditions in nativemembranes. Ideally, new techniques are needed for studying SR structural changes in anative environment, including even the inside the cell.In the revised project we will continue to use an array of advanced IR-based techniques,some of which have recently been developed in our laboratory, to examine the detailedmolecular events which lead to signal activation in SRs. Significant progress has beenmade in the past grant period leading to new molecular details and tentative models of SRfunction. In the proposed research, these models will be tested in detail by measuringstructural changes of specific residues, internal water molecules, and the peptidebackbone in SR receptor-transducer complexes on a time-scale of sub-picoseconds toseconds. A unique aspect of the proposed studies is the ability, for the first time, to studythese structural changes in intact functioning cells where direct correlation with otherevents, such as phototaxis and photoinduced charge movements, can be measured. Theproposed studies will also benefit from our development of new methods to: i) measuresub-picosecond structural changes in the protein and its internal water molecules usingadvanced ultrafast time-resolved IR spectroscopy and ii) rapidly express and isotope labelSRs and their transducer complexes using the technology of cell-free expressednanolipoparticles (NLPs).This work will be facilitated by close collaborations with the laboratories of Dr. J.Spudich at the University of Texas Medical Center, Houston, whose laboratory hascontributed much of our current knowledge about SRs, and Dr. M. Coleman at theLawrence Livermore National Laboratories, whose group has developed cell-freetechniques to express membrane proteins in NLPs. Specific objectives of this project are:"
3653,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have produced an interventional cardiac catheterization system (SBDX) which provides 70% of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of coronary angiography with only 15% of the patient skin dose, relative to conventional systems. We propose to modify this system to provide 100% of the SNR of a conventional system at 15% of the patient skin dose. This fluoroscopic system also has a unique ability to locate vessels and interventional devices in 3D at 30 frames/sec. We propose to use this ability to enhance the performance of two important clinical procedures: accurate balloon and stent sizing during coronary angioplasty and treatment of left atrial fibrillation using radio-frequency (RF) catheter ablation. AIM 1 - The increase in SNR will be accomplished by the construction of a new detector of the same design, but 2x greater area. We will demonstrate that we have reached our goal by comparison of image quality metrics and the results of porcine imaging studies on both SBDX and a state of the art conventional system. AIM 2 - We will demonstrate the ability of SBDX to perform accurate vessel and device sizing during the catheterization procedure, so that it may aid the interventionalist in the delivery of therapy. AIM 3 - We will demonstrate the ability of SBDX to aid the electrophysiologist with the localization of cardiac structures by providing real-time 3D catheter tracking and accurate registration of CT and fluoroscopic images during the procedure. Heart disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in our society. Over 500,000 coronary angioplasties and 100,000 RF catheter ablation procedures are performed annually in our country, saving many lives and improving the quality of many more. The successful outcome of this research will provide therapeutic tools which improve the outcomes of these procedures, while dramatically lowering the radiation exposure to the patient and medical staff."
3664,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A series of epidemiological studies have revealed a consistent association of circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease among apparently healthy individuals. CRP may have great clinical values on cardiovascular risk assessment and early prevention, and its underlying pathological mechanisms may provide novel therapeutic strategies. However, further application of CRP on clinical practice is hampered by a key issue -- whether CRP is a direct risk mediator for cardiovascular disease or it is merely an innocent bystander. Due to the inherent limitations of in vitro experiments on the CRP study, in vivo study on suitable animal models has become essential to address this issue. We propose to create a transgenic rat model that over-expresses the human CRP gene in the liver. Our selection of rats rather than mice is based on recent observations from the CRP transgenic mice and the CRP intraperitoneally injected rats. Compared with intraperitoneal injection, transgenic over-expression offers a long-term and stable elevation of human CRP in the rats. Specifically, we will (1) generate ALB-hCRP transgenic rats driven by the albumin enhancer/promoter; and (2) perform a pilot phenotype characterization of ALB-hCRP transgenic rats on systematic inflammation, endothelial activation and vascular lesion formation. We anticipate that this animal model will provide an in vivo platform for exploring the CRP pathological role in the development of cardiovascular disease. It will also provide a platform for screening and testing new preventive and therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease based on new understandings of the CRP biology."
3669,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial malformations are among the most common birth defects in children and lead to substantial morbidity and mortality for these infants. Despite the severity of the illness, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are necessary for correct formation of facial structures. In this proposal, we will investigate craniofacial development in an emerging model system, Xenopus tropicalis. During a recent forward genetic screen, we identified two mutants, jaws and jawbreaker, that exhibit a specific embryonic defect in the development of craniofacial structures. These mutants show a simple Mendelian inheritance pattern suggestive of a single recessive mutant locus. Outside of the craniofacial defect, the remainder of the embryo appears wildtype. It is the goal of this proposal to characterize these two mutants and identify where and when during development craniofacial patterning begins to fail. In a second aim, we will attempt to identify the mutant locus which will greatly improve our understanding of the molecular patterning defect. Because our understanding of craniofacial morphogenesis remains superficial, characterizing these mutants has the potential of substantially improving our understanding of craniofacial development and malformations. In addition, this will represent one of the very first attempts to clone a mutant identified in a forward genetic screen in X. tropicalis. Successful completion of these goals will greatly support future genetic screens in this emerging model system.     Birth defects of the head and neck are a common cause of serious illness in infants. Yet, our scientific understanding of how these structures form during embryonic development remains superficial. We propose a series of experiments to analyze two frog mutants that have abnormal jaw structure. A better understanding of these frog mutants can then be used as a model to understand birth defects of the head and neck in humans."
3688,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical research, much of it sponsored by NIAID, has markedly improved survival of patients with HIV/AIDS. However, the epidemic continues to grow both in both developed and the developing world. In the U.S., minority groups, especially African-Americans, are disproportionately affected throughout the country. Nationally, African-Americans make up 40% of AIDS cases but only 12.3% of the U.S. population. This disparity is even greater among children and adolescents (ages 13 to 19 years), among whom African Americans make up 60% of AIDS cases but only 15% of the U.S. population. In Memphis, approximately 46% of the population is African-Americans but 90% of the HIV and AIDS cases occur n African-Americans. In addition, data from the CDC show that cumulatively, 36% of all reported AIDS cases have been in the South, but the South accounted for 45% of new AIDS cases in 2003. These data confirm the disproportionate growth of the epidemic in this region. Because of the evolving epidemiology of HIV infection in the U.S., Memphis is an ideal location for a domestic HIV/AIDS Clinical Trial Unit (CTU). Memphis is a large Southern urban area that provides tertiary health care for individuals in an approximately 200-mile radius in the states of Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, and Arkansas. This area has been identified as one of the poorest in the nation. Here, the proposed CTU, located at: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, will provide clinical trial access for to underrepresented populations that are most severely affected by the epidemic;, including women, adolescents, and African-Americans. The proposed CTU is currently a Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Unit and is affiliated with the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group. The unit will have a single site located at St. Jude with a consortium agreement with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. The unit will address all four scientific aims of IMPAACT: Prevention of Maternal to Child Transmission of HIV; Translational Research/Drug Development; Optimization of Clinical Management including Co- Morbidities; and Vaccine Research and Development. Based on the availability of severely affected populations, the experienced staff, and the strong history of clinical trial conduct and scientific contributions to the PACTG, the St Jude CTU will be a valued domestic unit for IMPAACT.

3716,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder with variable phenotypic expression that includes significant morbidity and mortality. The mortality is largely the result of vascular complications, including strokes and myocardial infarctions. Fabry disease has often been described as a small vessel vasculopathy based on pathology consistent with the occlusion of small vessels with excess globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). However, the vascular complications as well as the role of Gb3 in the pathogenesis of hemolytic uremic syndrome suggest that there may be a role for Gb3 in arterial pathology involving much larger blood vessels. Surprisingly, when alpha- galactosidase A knockout mice were first created and phenotyped, there was no obvious large or small vessel pathology observed. However, the applicant has recently identified an arterial vasculopathy in the alpha- galactosidase A knockout mouse marked by a robust thrombosis and impaired vasodilation. Based on these studies the following primary hypothesis is proposed. The alpha -galactosidase A deficiency and globotriaosylceramide accumulation in Fabry disease result in an arterial vasculopathy. This vasculopathy results from aberrant regulation of agonist stimulated cell signaling through non-receptor-tyrosine kinases and impaired formation vasoactive compounds including nitric oxide. The following Specific Aims are proposed. 1. Determine the role of altered globotriaosylceramide content in impaired endothelial cell signaling by agonists that stimulate eNOS activity in model in vitro systems. 2. Determine the mechanism for the vasodilatory defect in the Gla-/0 mouse. 3. Determine the efficacy of therapies designed to deplete globotriaosylceramide, including substrate inhibition and recombinant alpha -galactosidase A administration on mitigating the thrombotic and vasoactive defects in the Gla-/0 mouse. 4. Evaluate the role of globotriaosylceramide in mediating the altered thrombotic response and vasoactivity by epistasis with the creation of a Gb3 synthase knockout mouse."
3725,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ultrasound contrast agents are stabilized microbubbles with diameters on the order of 1-10 microns. Because the compressibility of the gas core of these microbubbles, they are substantially more echogenic than the interfaces between different types of tissue that ultrasound is traditionally used to detect. To this date, available microbubble contrast agents are produced with techniques which result in a polydisperse size distribution. Since the resonance frequency of the contrast agent depends on its diameter, an aliquot of current contrast agents has a wide range of resonance frequencies. This variance limits the sensitivity of current ultrasound imaging systems, which have bandwidth limits which permit detection of only a narrow range of resonance frequencies. With this research, we will produce a new type of contrast agent with a small size distribution. Significantly decreasing the polydispersity of the contrast agent will result in an increase in the sensitivity of the imaging system. Through simulations, we have estimated that by reducing the standard deviation in the size distribution from the current average of 1.5 microns to 0.2 microns would increase sensitivity of the imaging system over 500%.  Recently, our research group has demonstrated that nearly monodisperse contrast agents can be produced using a technique known as flow-focusing. In this proposal, support is requested for manufacture and testing of a novel type of microfluidic system designed to produce monodisperse, micron-sized, contrast agents. Preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of using microfluidic technology for achieving the desired goal. We are able to produce bubbles on the order of 8 microns using a flow-focusing microfluidic device. The further development of this microfluidic system, and resulting production of monodisperse contrast agents, will open several new avenues for high sensitivity targeted ultrasound imaging."
3738,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project focuses on an enduring problem in the study of speech: How are perception and production linked? The specific aims address the process of speech perception while listening and talking. When individuals speak, the sound of their own voice is a powerful influence on the accuracy of fluent speech and is a major force in learning to speak. This grant proposal asks whether  listening to yourself  (feedback perception) is different from listening to others (communicative perception). The key to our work is a real-time signal processing system that permits perturbations of auditory feedback of speech with a very short time delay. The formant shifting system that we have implemented has an iteration delay of less than 1 ms, and the duration of the analysis window is chosen to provide an effective delay of approximately 9.5 ms. Thus, talkers in our studies produce utterances but hear spectrally modified versions of them through headphones as they speak. Three separate projects tackle different aspects of our question. The first project tries to determine if the operational principles (e.g., sensitivities, category boundaries) are the same for feedback and communicative perception. The second project uses short-term learning or adaptation paradigms to see whether the two types of perception are functionally linked. If one type of perception is changed, does it influence the other? The final project involves mapping the neural correlates of speech perception. We use our innovative signal processing system to study the network of brain regions involved in processing auditory feedback of speech. By focusing on the impact that producing speech has on the perception of speech these studies will add significantly to our understanding of the psychophysical, cognitive and anatomical relationships between speech perception and production. The studies proposed here also are relevant to a range of clinical populations (e.g. schizophrenia, fluency disorders, hearing impairment) in which the relation between perception and production is an ongoing research and intervention focal point."
3775,HHS,HHS,"Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a biochemical pathway critical to normal development and tissuehomeostasis in multi-cellular organisms. Aberrant suppression of apoptosis is a requisite contributor tohuman cancer. The long-term objective of this application is to elucidate the intracellular pathways and themolecular mechanisms that lead to apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family proteins are major regulators of apoptosis.Genetic and biochemical studies establish that two of the Bcl-2 family proteins, Bax and Bak, are requisitemediators of the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. In order to initiate apoptosis, Bax needs toundergo an activation process, which involves its mitochondrial translocation, the formation of Bax homo-oligomers, and the subsequent damage of mitochondria, a hallmark of apoptosis. The mechanisms of thisactivation process remain poorly understood. Using techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology, thisproposal aims at determining the molecular mechanisms of Bax activation during apoptosis. In Aim 1, wewill determine the mechanism of mitochondrial translocation of Bax. The role of mitochondrial targetingsequence(s), conformational changes, and dimeric states of Bax in its mitochondrial translocation will beexamined. In Aim 2, the helices and amino acid residues critical for the oligomerization of Bax will bedefined. Mutational study and biochemical assays will be used to examine the role of homo-oliomerization inthe apoptotic activity of Bax. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanism of Bax activation by upstreamactivators. In addition, loss-of-functionstudies using siRNA will be combined with in vitro studies to examinethe role of other Bcl-2 family proteins in the activation of Bax during apoptosis. These studies will determinethe molecular mechanisms of Bax activation and will help elucidate the pathways that lead to apoptosis.Upon a successful completion, this proposal will not only provide basic knowledge on the regulation ofapoptosis, but may also provide new insights on the design of therapeutic agents against cancer."
3781,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in AIDS patients is associated with both B-cell lymphomas and oral hairy leukoplakia. The EBV immediate-early (IE) proteins, BZLF1 and BRLF1, mediate the switch between the latent and lytic forms of EBV infection. In addition, the IE proteins have a profound effect on the host cell environment. In this competitive grant renewal, we propose to continue our long-term studies on the role of the two EBV IE proteins in EBV-associated diseases. We hypothesize that the two EBV IE proteins are not only required to induce the lytic form of EBV infection, but may also help to support certain EBV-associated malignancies through a paracrine mechanism. We have recently discovered that BZLF1 preferentially binds to, and activates, the BRLF1 IE promoter only after it has been methylated over a CpG motif contained within a BZLF1 binding site. Thus, BZLF1 appears to be uniquely suited for activating the methylated form of the viral genome. We have also recently identified a new viral transactivator protein, BRRF1, and shown that BRRF1 collaborates with BRLF1 to induce lytic EBV infection. In addition, recent data from our laboratory suggest that paracrine factors released from lytically infected cells are required for the development of EBV-associated lymphomas in vivo. Our specific aims are as follows. In Specific Aim 1, we will compare and contrast how epigenetic modifications of the two IE viral promoters (including DNA methylation and histone acetylation) affect the ability of BZLF1 versus BRLF1 to disrupt viral latency, and determine whether the novel ability of BZLF1 to preferentially activate the methylated form of the BRLF1 IE promoter is important for BZLF1 function. In Specific Aim 2, we will further investigate the mechanisms by which BRLF1 and BRRF1 both individually transactivate the BZLF1 IE promoter in EBV-negative cells, and collaborate to induce lytic infection in EBV-positive cells. In Specific Aim 3, we will use wild-type, as well as BZLF1 - and BRLF1-knock-out viruses, to infect epithelial cells and determine if IE proteins are important for viral pathogenesis or transformation in these cells. The proposed studies should yield important insight into the multiple roles that lytic EBV proteins play in EBV-associated diseases."
3792,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) develop in the late phase of infection a complex of neurological signs termed Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome-related Dementia (AIDSD). These patients exhibit a broad spectrum of motor impairments and cognitive deficits, which follow or parallel cellular loss, atrophy and morphological changes in their brains. The viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 has been suggested to be one of the causal agents of neuronal loss observed in these patients. However, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanism(s) of the neurotoxic effect of gp120. Data from a previous proposal have established that gp120 causes neuronal cell death by activating an apoptotic pathway through the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Interestingly, the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) prevents gp120-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro by decreasing CXCR4 levels. These data lead to the overall hypothesis that BDNF may reduce gp120 toxicity also in vivo. We propose to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby BDNF blocks gp120 neurotoxicity and the involvement of CXCR4. In particular, we plan to examine the role of CXCR4 in gp120-mediated toxicity in vivo by injecting gp120IIIB into the lateral ventricle of rats and comparing its toxic activity with that of gpBal, a strain of gp120 that binds to the chemokine receptor CCR5. We propose to analyze apoptosis by immunohistochemical and biochemical assessment of activated caspase-3 and caspase-9, two proteases that play a crucial role in the apoptotic pathway. These studies will be accompanied by experiments aimed at establishing the molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby BDNF regulates CXCR4 expression. We propose to use BDNF heterozygous (+/-) mice and cerebellar granule cells in culture. In these studies, we will test the hypothesis that BDNF is neuroprotective against gp120 because of its ability to reduce the expression of CXCR4 or increase its internalization. CXCR4 expression will be determined by histological and biochemical detection of CXCR4 immunoreactivity and mRNA, and CXCR4 internalization will be monitored by quantifying beta-arrestin- mediated endocytosis. Moreover, we propose to establish whether BDNF, infused in the lateral ventricle or by recombinant adeno-associated virus, impairs the ability of gp120 to induce apoptosis. Overall, the results of the present study 1) will provide a major break-through on the mechanisms whereby gp120 causes neuronal cell death and the related morphological alterations that may account for the motor and cognitive deficits found in human AIDSD, and 2) will explore the significance of endogenous and exogenous BDNF in the development of a new therapeutic approach for HIV-1-related neurodegenerative diseases."
3799,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene silencing at the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) is achieved through the formation of facultative heterochromatin, a feature that is remarkably stable and faithfully retained at the Xi throughout subsequent cell divisions. We have found that heterochromatin of the human Xi is organized into non-overlapping types of heterochromatin that occupy defined genomic intervals. Two distinct heterochromatin types can be defined based upon the presence of characteristic chromatin markers: I,macroH2A and XIST RNA; II, HP1 and histone H3 methylated at lysine-9. The strict spatial arrangement of these epigenetic features correlates directly with variation in the pattern of replication in late S-phase and with the Xi gene expression profile.  These data provide the framework for testing interrelationships between the epigenetic and epiphenotypic features of Xi heterochromatin. The experiments described here have two specific aims: (i) To precisely define the proximal and distal boundaries of the major Xi Type-I territory; and (ii) To investigate the role of the protein components of each territory in maintaining and/or constraining the heterochromatin types along the Xi. These experiments will generate a detailed map across the specified interval, allowing us to determine the precise organization of epigenetic markers relative both to one another and to the Xi epiphenotypes, thus acting as a model for the entire Xi. By selectively removing specific heterochromatin markers, we will be able to monitor the effects on all features of the Xi, allowing us to determine the functional significance of the epigenetic components in maintaining Xi heterochromatin. Not only will these data substantially advance our understanding of X-inactivation, they will also provide valuable insight generally into the regulation of gene expression and the inheritance of defined chromatin states, a critically important aspect of all human development and cellular differentiation."
3853,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cell membrane has a 2-dimensional liquid-like structure containing domains that form and disperse continuously on various time and space scales. Rafts are membrane domains that require lipid interactions for their formation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which rafts form, are maintained and disintegrate in biological membranes, in particular in the plasma membrane of fiber cells of the eye lens. Detergent insolubility, which has been used to define rafts biochemically, does not reflect pre-existing structures and organization of the membrane. Furthermore, such an approach is not useful for understanding the size, lifetime and dynamics of the raft-constituent molecules and the raft itself. To address these issues, it is proposed to apply the pulse EPR spin labeling technique  discrimination by oxygen transport (DOT)  for in situ studies of rafts in both model and cell membranes. Since the spin-lattice relaxation time of spin labels is sufficiently long, membrane dynamics can be observed on the time scale 0.1 - 100 mu s. The DOT method permits discrimination of different membrane domains because the collision rate between O2 and the nitroxide moiety of spin labels (oxygen diffusion-concentration product) can be quite different in these domains. Additionally, membrane domains can be characterized by profiles of the oxygen diffusion concentration product in situ without the need for separation. This method is especially suitable for obtaining time-space characteristics of small/transient domains. It is hypothesized that rafts form liquid-ordered domains in the plasma membrane liquid-disordered environment. Membrane lipid composition as well as protein content is expected to modulate raft size and dynamics. The DOT method will be used to test the hypothesis on well-defined model systems in which domain size and the lipid exchange rate will be controlled by membrane lipid composition, selected protein and peptide content, and temperature. Furthermore, it will be used to study domain structure in cell membranes. These studies will include mature and aged fiber cell membranes in which the increased cholesterol/lipid ratio and elevated level of sphingomyelin create conditions favoring the formation of rafts. It is proposed: 1) to detect coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains in membranes containing cholesterol; 2) to evaluate the size and stability of the raft domains in model membranes made from raft-forming mixtures; 3) to examine how membrane anchored proteins and transmembrane alpha-helical peptides affect the organization and dynamics of these lipid raft domains; and 4) to apply the DOT method to look for raft domains in fiber cell plasma membranes of the eye lens during maturation and aging, as well as membrane models of mature, aged and cataractous lenses. Age-related nuclear cataract is a primary cause of blindness in the elderly in third world countries."
3860,HHS,NSF,"Active retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which is known to be a response to retinal hypoxia, occurs at theage of rapid rod outer segment development. The investigators postulate that rapidly increasing oxygendemands of the developing rods contribute to the hypoxia that instigates ROP, and, as a consequence ofunmet metabolic needs, rod function is impaired. While acknowledging that the  photoreceptor hypothesis ofROP  will not be put to direct test, knowledge of the development of the photoreceptors and of ROP createsa framework for the project. Completed studies in ROP subjects at post-term ages document evidence ofdamaged rods. In Aim 1 of the new project, rod cell sensitivity, Srod, will be measured at pre-term agesduring which ROP is typically active. This is important because demonstration of rod involvement in activeROP will warrant a new perspective on ROP management, the principle of which will be: Satisfy oxygenneeds of photoreceptors. A numeric analysis of preterm retinal blood vessels will be conducted. Srod andblood vessel parameters will be analyzed for prediction of ROP outcome, the probability of high risk pre-threshold ROP, and post-term development of retinal and visual function. In healthy ROP subjects, mildacuity deficits may be the common sign of a subtle maculopathy as residua of altered neural-vasculardevelopment of fovea and foveal avascular zone. In Aim 2, central retinal function will be evaluated(including multifocal ERG in ROP infants) and tracked through early childhood. Results to date demonstratean association of rod dysfunction and early ametropia, but more remains to be discovered about retinalmechanisms in that substantial proportion of ROP children who develop early ametropia. Accordingly, theexperiments of Aim 3 will update refractive measurements and analyze retinal mechanisms in child ROPsubjects who were previously studied in infancy. For each set of experiments, the analyses of the crosssectional data will evaluate the retinal and visual parameters for significant variation with ROP outcome. Thelongitudinal data will be evaluated for change over time and for variation with ROP outcome. The project willobtain new knowledge about the fundamental disease process, contribute to the understanding of refractivedevelopment in ROP, and provide new insights into the basis of common acuity deficits. This informationmay, in the future, change management of ROP in infancy and in children with a history of ROP."
3890,HHS,HHS,"Description: My objectives in seeking a K23 career development award are two-fold: 1) to use the infrastructure of the NEI-sponsored Steroid for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT) to examine whether adding topical steroids improves clinical outcomes of subgroups of bacterial corneal ulcers; 2) to develop my career as an independent investigator in ocular infection and inflammation by hands-on research experience, didactics and mentorship. There is ongoing controversy regarding the use of steroids in treating bacterial corneal ulcers. Additional data, including results in specific subgroups, are needed to help clinicians understand the risks vs benefits. Steroid for Corneal Ulcer Treatment (SCUT) is an NEI-funded, trial enrolling patients at the Proctor Foundation at UCSF, Arvind Eye Hospital in South India, and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. The main objective of SCUT is to study the effect of topical steroids on bacterial corneal ulcers, as measured by outcomes including best corrected visual acuity and scar size at 3 months. The investigator proposes to perform ancillary studies comparing baseline characteristics and clinical outcome by organisms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa vs. all others) by genetic difference (Invasive via cytotoxic P. aeruginosa) and by antibiotic susceptibility. Three specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1: to determine the effect of adjunctive topical steroid therapy on clinical outcomes in P. aeruginosa keratitis compared to bacterial keratitis due to the other organisms. Aim 2: To determine whether the invasive and cytotoxic subtypes of P. aeruginosa have different clinical signs at enrollment, or have a different response to treatment. Aim 3: To determine whether there is a correlation between antibiotic susceptibility and the clinical outcome in bacterial keratitis. The data and samples necessary for these aims are already being collected as part of the SCUT trial. As part of this research proposal, P.aeruginosa isolates will be subtyped for Aim 2 and the minimum inhibitory concentration of each bacterial isolate to the study antibiotic moxifloxacin will be determined for Aim 3. Regression models will be utilized to determine the impact of various factors, including treatment with steroids, bacterial isolate type, P.aeruginosa virulence factors, and minimum inhibitory concentration, on baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes in bacterial keratitis. Bacterial keratitis is a major cause of visual impairment worldwide, affecting both patients' quality of life and functional status. Our goal is to provide data to allow clinicians to risk-stratify patients with bacterial corneal ulcers in an evidence-based manner."
3904,HHS,NSF,"We have identified a novel photoreceptor of the mammalian retina, a rare retinal ganglion cell (RGC) thatdirectly innervates the circadian pacemaker of the hypothalamus. These intrinsically photosensitive RGCs(ipRGCs) respond to light even when synaptically isolated from other retinal neurons. They contain thenovel opsin photopigment melanopsin. They exhibit lower sensitivity and more sluggish kinetics than rodsand cones. Their remarkably tonic light responses encode ambient light levels. Besides their key role incircadian synchronization, these cells form a specialized retinal output channel that signals integrated retinalirradiance and drives a variety of 'non-image-forming' visual reflexes such as the pupillary light reflex,seasonal adaptations in physiology, photic inhibition of nocturnal melatonin release, and modulation of sleep,alertness and activity.We propose the first direct investigation of whether ipRGCs, like rods and cones, exhibit light and darkadaptation, adjusting their sensitivity according to current or recent light exposure. Such adaptation greatlyextends the dynamic range of rods and cones so that together they encompass the full spectrum ofphysiological light levels. Adaptation appears weak or absent in some 'non-image-forming' visual responses.While this might suggest a lack of adaptation in ipRGCs, some behavioral evidence and our preliminaryelectrophysiological data suggest that ipRGCs do adapt under some conditions. Characterizing adaptation inthese cells is a critical step in advancing our understanding of circadian photoreception and other non-image-forming photic systems.We will make intracellular recordings of ipRGC responses to light after manipulating prior light exposure. Wewill assess the magnitude, time course and spectral dependency of any adaptation. We will also determinewhether these occur within the photoreceptor itself, altering the gain of the phototransduction cascade, orwhether they require interactions with other retinal cells. The studies will also determine whether ipRGCssensitivity is under circadian control. The findings will advance our understanding of the functionalorganization of a novel photosensory system in the mammalian retina with well-defined roles in circadiantiming and other homeostatic functions related to ambient illumination and the solar cycle."
3923,HHS,HHS,"As a class, the camptothecins have been widely recognized for their therapeutic potential, which for manyreasons, including the instability of the lipophilic lactone moiety, has not been fully realized. DB-67 (7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) is a third generation analog that was engineered to be bloodstable and highly potent, on the basis of structure-activity relationship studies. The camptothecins have alabile a-hydroxy-5-lactone ring, which hydrolyzes to yield the negatively charged carboxylate form.Compared to the uncharged lactone, the negatively charged carboxylate is less likely to diffuse into cells andis often considered  inactive.  Based on its blood stability and anti-tumor activity, DB-67 was selected by theNCI for development through three cycles of the RAID program. Data from NCI studies and fromcollaborative efforts revealed impressive in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity, particularly in glioma models,but also in melanoma and colon xenograft models. Currently DB-67 formulation and toxicology studies havebeen completed and clinical grade material is available through the NCI. Based on the extensive formulation,toxicology, and pharmacokinetic profile observed in preclinical models, and its potential to exert a potentanti-tumor effect in humans, we hypothesize that DB-67 will be well-tolerated and efficacious in clinical trials.This grant application outlines the clinical studies and the correlative pharmacokinetic studies that will defineDB-67 disposition and toxicity in patients with refractory solid tumors. The following specific aims will beaccomplished: 1.1) To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and describe the dose limiting toxicities(DLT) of intravenous DB-67 administered once daily for 5 days every 21 days to adults with recurrent orrefractory solid tumors in which standard therapies are not effective; 1.2) To characterize the plasmapharmacokinetics of DB-67 and metabolites after intravenous administration and relate DB-67pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Ultimately, the objective is to use DB-67 as a single agent or in combinationwith other molecular-targeted therapies or cytotoxics in frontline therapy with the goal to improve overallpatient outcome."
3935,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work is aimed at establishing a quantitative physical understanding of the dynamic molecular structure of membranes using modern techniques of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy developed in the laboratory of Freed, (i.e. multi-frequency ESR and two-dimensional electron-electron double resonance [2D-ELDOR]), as well as spin-labels resembling natural components. Specific projects include the following. Studies of model membranes, wherein liquid crystalline and liquid ordered phases coexist, will provide insights into lateral heterogeneity and formation of domains in biological membranes. Studies on the plasma membranes of live RBL-2H3 mast cells and plasma membrane vesicles derived from them, will relate the observed differences in their dynamic structures to their differences in composition and molecular interactions; spectral changes resulting from cell stimulation will be related to changes in composition. The mechanistic basis for the role of lipid composition on integral membrane protein function is to be studied in membranes containing gramicidin A (GA). This includes molecular distortions on the boundary lipids that coat GA and the role of GA in lipid sorting. Measurements on spin-labeled GA will determine how the lipid and ionic membrane environments affect the equilibrium between, and structure of, GA dimer conformers. A critical assessment of gating models in the ligand-gated potassium channels KcsA and MthK will be provided. The structure of the voltage-sensing domain in KvAP will be studied. Double-quantum coherence (DQC)-ESR and DEER will be used to measure the distances in GA, KcsA, MthK and KvAP. The known fusogenicity of fusion peptides and their mutants will be correlated with changes in the ordering and motional rates they induce in the membrane lipids. Possible clinical applications include detection of membrane changes during immune response, prevention of viral entry, and neurological disorders."
3973,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Over the last 15 years, significant improvements in patient outcome have occurred such that heart transplantation is now considered an established therapy with a high likelihood for short-term success. However, the emotional, financial, social and medical burdens placed on patients and families remain enormous and heart transplantation therapy remains palliative. Indeed, most children transplanted in infancy and childhood are not predicted to survive to adulthood. The immunosuppressive regimens have many inherent risks including infections, malignancy and multiple end-organ toxicities. Furthermore, these agents have had little impact on the development of chronic rejection, the leading cause of death late after transplantation. The central paradigm driving this integrated SCCOR proposal is that further improvements in clinical outcome following pediatric heart transplantation depend upon novel strategies that link basic science advances with evidence-driven modifications in clinical protocols. This SCCOR proposal will bring together experts in the fields of pediatric cardiology (cardiac transplantation) and cardiac surgery, immunology, infectious disease, molecular genetics, and biostatistics to advance the common goal of developing novel approaches to the management of pediatric heart transplant recipients. Our long-term goals are to:      1. Develop strategies that result in long-term graft acceptance without requiring immunosuppression.  2. Develop strategies to reduce the morbidities related to non-specific immunosuppressive protocols.  3. Identify genetic markers that predict disparities in transplant outcomes in children after transplantation, including racial disparities.  4. Develop non-invasive diagnostic strategies for rejection surveillance that reduce cost and improve quality and length of life.    This Pediatric CV SCCOR proposal addresses each of these areas with novel, hypothesis driven projects to rapidly and significantly advance the state-of-the-art care for pediatric heart transplant recipients."
4003,HHS,NSF,"Determining how morphological differences arise is a subject of great importance in evolutionarybiology but one that has been very difficult to address experimentally. However, with the recent advent ofthe field of evolutionary and developmental biology (evo-devo), it is now becoming feasible to bring new andinteresting species into the lab to ask molecular and genetic questions. Most evo-devo studies either focus on macroevolution (large-scale) or microevolution (small-scale).Microevolutionary studies have been very valuable in discovering genetic changes causing morphologicalchange because the time difference separating the populations in question is relatively short. One questionthat still remains is whether the path of microevolutionary change represents on a shorter time scale thepath of changes on a larger time scale. To really understand the evolution of morphological change inspeciation, we need to address the seemingly impossible goal of looking at the genetics of morphologicalevolution in species separated by great time differences. One way of bridging the gap between evolution on a short time scale and evolution on a longer timescale is to look at a morphology that shows great diversity both within species and between species. Wepropose to study antennal development molecularly and genetically across three different time scales:between insects and crustaceans, between different crustacean species, and within a crustacean speciesthat has intraspecific antennal variation. We will be using a candidate gene approach, assaying geneexpression of genes known to be involved in antennal development in insects in crustacean species withdiffering antennal morphologies. We will also functionally pursue some of these genes in the crustaceanParhyale hawaiensis, a species amenable to molecular analyses. Using a candidate genetic approach, wewill examine intraspecific antennal variation in a species that has cave and surface dwelling populations. Studying the genetic and molecular basis behind phenotypic change is very important from a medicalstandpoint; one of the major goals in human genetics is to figure out what genetic changes are responsiblefor diseases and other conditions. Understanding the genetic and molecular basis of phenotypic change inspecies in which laboratory experiments are possible will allow insight into the process of evolution: whattypes of genes are affected, what types of mutations are in these genes, and how much of the variation in a particular trait is encoded genetically and environmentally. This information will yield a greater understanding of evolutionary change which will be helpful in the analysis of the human genome."
4006,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work has relevance to our understanding of mechanisms and potential therapies for disorders of brain development. PITX2 is a member of the paired-like class of transcription factors that regulate expression of multiple other genes, through direct binding to DNA. In humans, PITX2 is mutated in Rieger syndrome, a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome affecting eyes, umbilicus, and teeth, with variable abnormalities in the heart, pituitary, and brain. PITX2 is produced in embryonic and adult mammalian brain neurons, but its function in these cells is unknown. In mice, loss of PITX2 function results in abnormal development of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus and superior colliculus, but the exact requirements for Pitx2 in neuronal progenitor proliferation and differentiation are not known. Homozygous loss of Pitx2 is lethal in midgestation due to severe defects of thoracic and abdominal organs, limiting the use of these mice for analysis of PITX2 function in the brain at later time points. PITX2 is expressed in mice from two different promoters as three separate isoforms (a, b, c) that exhibit unique functions in cardiac and craniofacial development; the relative contributions of these different PITX2 isoforms to brain development have not been determined. Our prior studies identified PITX2 expression in discrete neuronal populations in the developing mouse brain, and demonstrated disrupted neuronal development in the subthalamic nucleus and superior colliculus with loss of Pitx2 function. Our global working hypothesis is that PITX2 regulates expression of genes required for one or more aspects of neuronal differentiation, including migration and axon outgrowth, in a brain region-specific and isoform-specific manner. Proposed studies will examine the production, migration, axon formation, and cell fate of developing PITX2 mutant neurons, using existing PITX2cre and isoform specific PITX2 loss of function alleles and a novel PITX2-TaulacZ knock-in allele. Results obtained from these experiments will impact our understanding of PITX2- mediated transcriptional mechanisms that regulate neuronal differentiation and survival. Proposed studies will also uncover PITX2 functions in neuronal differentiation and survival in other regions of the mouse brain, thereby providing crucial insights into the potential role(s) for PITX2 in Rieger syndrome and other developmental brain disorders. These results will help guide future experiments aimed at directing neural stem cell differentiation toward specific neuronal cell subtypes."
4019,HHS,HHS,"Clinically, ischemic stroke is recognized as a sexually dimorphic disease. Reproductive hormones are amajor contributor to differences in male and female pathobiology. However, emerging data clearly showthat outcome from stroke is shaped by biologic sex in addition to hormone exposure. The major hypothesisof this proposal is that distinct gender-based cell death programs are activated after an ischemic insult. Wewill investigate and identify molecular cell death pathways that are differentially regulated by gender. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify and evaluate the major pathways of cell death activated inmale and female brain after in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We hypothesize that male celldeath is mediated primarily by the caspase-independent activation of nitric oxide (NO), peroxynitriteformation, oxidant-induced DMA damage, and activation of PARP-1, leading to the release of apoptosisinducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria. In contrast, cell death in females is predominately caspase-dependent and secondary to ischemia-induced release of cytochrome C, activation of caspase-9 andformation of the apoptosome. Selective interference with each of these pathways will lead to differentoutcomes in males and females. In Aim 1we will examine hormonally controlled wild type (WT) andPARP-/- mice to determine the extent of AIF translocation. We will reduce AIF levels in animals of bothgenders and assess outcomes after stroke. Aim 2 will evaluate cytochrome C release and caspaseformation and determine the effect of caspase inhibition in both genders. Gender differences in X-linkedinhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) will be examined in Aim 3. Finally, in Aim 4 we will examine the production ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) and bioenergetic markers in males and females.Relevance: Emerging pre-clinical data suggests that the fundamental pathways leading to cell death differin males and females. Recently, gender differences in the response to pharmaceutical agents used to bothprevent (aspirin) and treat (thrombolytics) stroke have been described. Understanding these differences willallow us to develop novel and more efficacious therapies that will enhance the health of stroke patients ofboth sexes."
4028,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In recent years, tremendous advances have been made in understanding viral biology and immune responses to viral infection. In the majority of viral infections, the acute phase of infection is associated with successful immune responses leading to the containment of viremia and viral spread. However, certain viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), are able to establish persistent infection. In this proposal, we are going to use the Lymphochoriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model of infection to probe why one set of immune responses is hampered in chronic infection.     LCMV has been widely used as a murine model of host pathogenesis, and depending on the LCMV strain utilized, either self-resolving acute infection (e.g., LCMV Armstrong) or persistent infection (e.g., LCMV clone 13) can be obtained. The work we performed in our original SCORE pilot project has thus far lead to the characterization of a set of nine CD4+ T-cell epitopes after LCMV Armstrong infection, showing a broad repertoire of responses in the setting of successful control of viral replication. However, these responses were not detected in chronic infection with LCMV clone 13. Even though these responses could be elicited after immunization, subsequent LCMV clone 13 infection resulted in their suppression. It has also been recently shown by other groups that programmed death-1 (PD-1) is up-regulated in T-cells in chronic infection, resulting in their apoptosis. It remains to be seen whether this applies to CD4+ T-cells in persistent LCMV infection.     We hypothesize that infection with persistent LCMV viral strains leads to impairment of LCMV-specific CD4+ T-cell immunity contributing to the establishment of persistent infection. The long-term goal of this proposal is to mechanistically define how CD4+ T-cells are impaired in chronic infection. To address this, our specific aims consist of the following: (1) to determine whether effective LCMV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses develop after persistent LCMV infection using virus-pulsed antigen presenting cells and CD4+ T-cells from infected animals in ELISPOT assays; (2) to understand whether CD4+ T-cell impairment is a result of deletion and/or dysfunction in persistent LCMV infection by following CD4+ T-cells with tetramer staining and lymphokine production; (3) to determine whether CD4+ T-cell responses can be rescued in the setting of LCMV persistent infection by investigating if CD4+ T-cells express high levels of PD-1 which can be blocked."
4056,HHS,HHS,"Temporal lobe epilepsy: validation of a new animal modelNearly one third of all patients with epilepsy are refractory to current antiepileptic drugs. These patients areoften affected by significant adverse effects due to multi-drug treatment and high drug dosage; thus, moreefficacious therapies that will improve the patient's quality of life are clearly needed. The discovery of bettertherapies has been lagging due to a lack of validated animal models that more closely recapitulate thehuman epileptogenic state. Based on studies of surgically resected hippocampal tissue from patients withmedically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TIE), we propose here a novel rat model of TLE by chronic,intracerebral infusions of the glutamine synthetase antagonist, methionine sulfoximine (MSO). This modelreproduces a prominent feature of the pathology of human TLE, namely a deficiency of glutamine synthetasein the hippocampus. Preliminary results indicate that the MSO-treated animals develop recurrent seizuresand several neuropathological characteristics of the human disease. This proposal seeks to further validatethe model as a prelude for future testing of novel therapeutic approaches. The following features will bevalidated: (1) Intracranial EEG recordings will seek to confirm the mesial temporal origin of the seizures andprovide information on other important seizure parameters. (2) Neurohistological studies will attempt to mapand quantitate the limited damage to the hippocampus and other brain areas. (3) In vivo microdialysisstudies will determine whether extracellular levels of glutamate are elevated in the epileptogenichippocampus, as in human TLE.Relevance to public health: Nearly 800,000 Americans with epilepsy suffer from uncontrolled seizures thatcannot be treated with currently available drugs. More effective therapies of epilepsy are therfore needed.This proposal seeks to validate a new animal model that may greatly speed up the search for bettertherapies against this disorder."
4066,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gliobastoma is a devastating brain tumor, for which there is no cure; patients succumb between 6 to 12 months after their diagnosis. Human glioma cell lines and more than 80% of gliomas in situ express high amounts of an IL-13 receptor (IL-13a2R), different from that expressed in normal tissues (IL13R/IL4R), a feature that can be used to target molecules to glioma cells without affecting the surrounding brain tissue. To this end, human IL-13 (hIL-13) has been fused to a mutated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). After receptor-mediated internalization into IL13a2R-expressing glioma cells, it inhibits protein synthesis, leading to cell death. A mutant of hIL-13, i.e., IL13.E13K (muIL-13), has shown negligible binding to normal brain cells and higher affinity for the glioma-specific IL-13 receptor than wild type hIL-13. Our goal is to construct a high capacity adenoviral vector (HC-Adv) encoding the chimeric toxin, muIL-13-PE. To increase the safety, the vector will also encode the cDNA of a mutated IL-4, i.e., IL4.Y124D (muIL4), an antagonist of the IL13R/IL4R present in normal cells; which does not interact with IL13a2R expressed in glioma cells, nor does it affect the cytotoxicity of the chimeric toxin. Further, we will incorporate the regulatory TetON system into the viral vector which will allow tight regulation of expression of the therapeutic transgene, by switching it  on  and  off  by the addition or withdrawal of doxycicline (DOX). The effects of muIL-13-PE expressed by transduced cells will be assessed in vitro in human glioma cell lines and in vivo in the normal brain. We will perform dose-escalation studies following administration of the HC-Adv vectors encoding the targeted toxin within the brain of immune competent mice. We will also asses its therapeutic efficacy in intracranial human gliomas implanted in nude mice. We will determine expression levels, therapeutic efficiency, survival, side effects, and persistence of the viral vector genomes within the tumor and adjacent brain tissue in vivo. Considering the putative side effects reported after the systemic administration of the chimeric toxin, we hypothesize that the administration of the HC-Adv vector expressing muIL-13-PE, to glioma bearing mice will lead to effective intratumoral levels of the high affinity chimeric toxin, killing glioma cells but preserving normal brain tissue. Previous data provide strong evidence that HC-Adv vectors will exert long term, regulatable expression of the toxin even in the presence of systemic anti-adenoviral immunity as could be present in humans. Expression muIL4 will further prevent muIL13-PE binding to normal surrounding brain cells without affecting its cytotoxicity on glioma cells, adding a significant safety feature to our approach. Finally, the introduction of the TetON regulatory system will allow tight regulation of expression of the encoded chimeric toxin. In summary, we expect to develop a targeted glioma gene therapy approach with high therapeutic efficacy and negligible toxicity which could be translated into clinical trials."
4079,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand the relationships between genes essential for anterior segment development and glaucoma. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that genes essential for anterior segment development, when mutated can interact with other loci to promote and affect the course of glaucoma. The glaucomas are a heterogeneous group of ocular disorders characterized by retinal ganglion cell death, optic nerve damage and visual field loss. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor. Several mutations have been identified in human genes that result in anterior segment dysgenesis and contribute to glaucoma. Pedigree analysis of these developmental glaucomas, as well as most other forms of glaucoma, indicate that multiple genetic loci act in concert to cause and affect the progression of the disease. However, the identities of many of these relevant genes are not known. We propose to use zebrafish to identify and study genes which regulate anterior segment development and interact with other loci to cause glaucoma. To accomplish this objective, we will first thoroughly evaluate anterior segment development in wild type fish and assess the roles of two developmentally important genes known to contribute to glaucoma in humans (Imx1b and foxC1). Next we will apply our knowledge of development to characterize a new zebrafish mutation (bug eye) which causes anterior segment anomalies when homozygous and when heterozygous and inherited with another mutation causes elevated intraocular pressure and progressive ganglion cell loss in adults. Concurrent with detailed phenotype evaluation in embryos, the molecular genetic defects in the critical loci will be identified."
4118,HHS,HHS,"Cardiovascular homeostasis is delicately balanced between contractile and relaxant smooth muscleinfluences in all vascular beds. Whereas regulation of vascular contraction has been reasonably well studiedin neonates, the effects of postnatal maturation on mechanisms of vasorelaxation remain understudied andpoorly understood. Recent work in our laboratory strongly suggests that the hypocontractility typical ofimmature cerebral arteries involves an upregulation of cGMP-dependent attenuation of vascular tone thatcannot be explained simply by elevated cGMP concentrations. Thus, we propose that the ability of ProteinKinase Gto elicit cerebral vasodilatation is upregulated in immature cerebral arteries. Toaddress thiscore hypothesis, five specific aims are proposed. Aim #1 will employ Western blots, immunohistochemistry,and kinetic measurements of enzyme activity to test the hypothesis that maturation modulates the relativeabundance, distribution, and activity of Protein Kinase G (PKG). Aim #2 will utilize autoradiographicmeasurements of receptor density, agonist affinity and assays for IPS content to test the idea that maturationalters the ability of cGMP/PKG to influence G-protein receptor-mediated IPS mobilization. Aim #3 will usemeasurements of IPS receptor density and binding affinity, calcium store size, and IPS-induced calciumrelease to explore the idea that maturation alters the ability of PKG to attenuate IPS-mediated calciumrelease. Aim #4 tests the idea that maturation alters cGMP-dependent modulation of thick filament reactivity,as indicated by shifts in the relations between cytosolic calcium and myosin light chain phosphorylation. Foraim #4 the time courses of myosin light chain phosphorylation induced by potassium will be measured viaurea gels in samples from both intact and permeabilized arteries treated with cGMP and/or inhibitors ofmyosin phosphatase. Aim #5 tests the hypothesis that maturation alters the ability of cGMP/PKG tomodulate thin filament reactivity, as indicated by shifts in the relations between the extent of myosin lightchain phosphorylation and contractile force. For aim #5, myosin light chain phosphorylation will bemeasured together with contractile force and the relative abundances and phosphorylation states of thepotential thin-filament regulatory proteins HSP27 and HSP20. Quantitative integration of the results of theseexperiments will enable an unprecedented evaluation of the sites of action of postnatal maturation on cGMP-mediated pathways of vasorelaxation, and will provide a unique assessment of the relative importance ofeach main group of PKG targets for overall cerebrovascular homeostasis in the fetus, neonate and adult.This approach should also identify which cGMP-dependent mechanisms may be most amenable totherapeutic pharmacological manipulation in the critically ill neonate."
4121,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for a competing renewal for an NIMH Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research.  This grant builds on Dr. Katon's extensive research in developing cost-effective interventions to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with major depression and panic disorder within primary care systems, and to improve understanding about the prevalence and impact of depressive and anxiety disorders in patients with comorbid medical disorders such as diabetes.  The grant also builds on Dr. Katon's experience over two decades in successfully mentoring junior investigators to become independent researchers, including his 15 years of experience as Director of an NIMH T32 NRSA Primary Care-Psychiatry Fellowship.  This K24 will enhance Dr. Katon's expertise in epidemiology, biostatistics, health economics and disease management, which will improve his ability to mentor junior colleagues as well as to carry out the patient-oriented research proposed in his current NIMH R01 and other ongoing and new research proposals.  The three specific career goals that will be met by the K24 are:  1) To demonstrate in population-based studies the impact of depressive and anxiety disorders in patients with chronic medical illness.  The evidence from the population-based studies will be developed in two ways:  a) epidemiologic data showing the cross-sectional and longitudinal effect of depression/anxiety on symptom burden, functioning, quality of life, self-care, medical costs and medical outcomes; and b) intervention studies demonstrating that improved quality of care and outcomes of depression in patients with chronic illness results in decreased symptom burden, improved functioning and quality of life, improved self-care and improved disease outcomes (such as HbA1c) at reasonable costs; 2) To continue to disseminate collaborative models of care by:  a) expanding evidence of this model's cost-effectiveness in improving outcomes of elderly, underserved populations, and patients with anxiety disorders; b) expanding the evidence that these models have a significant impact on policy-relevant outcomes such as days off work and cut down days at reasonable medical costs; c) developing a fidelity measure of program implementation of collaborative care that can test which components of collaborative care are most important in improving outcomes; and d) developing evidence-based quality of care guidelines for optimizing depression outcomes for HEDIS performance measures; and 3) To continue to expand Dr. Katon's mentorship of junior investigators involved in mental health services research.  These goals will be met through continued and expanded research activities, graduate-level coursework in epidemiology, health services, health management, biostatistics and health economics at the University of Washington School of Public Health and mentorship from external consultants.  These courses will improve Dr. Katon's ability as a mentor as well as enhancing the proposed cutting-edge research activities in cost-effectiveness analysis, meta-analysis, measuring indirect costs (work productivity and absenteeism), development of a fidelity measure of collaborative care and an enhanced understanding of organizational and regulatory issues in disseminating collaborative care models.  A K24 at this stage of the applicant's career will provide release from administrative responsibilities and provide the time and resources needed to capitalize on an excellent network of senior investigators who will provide mentoring and potential collaborative research opportunities."

4125,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chlamydia are gram-negative bacterial pathogens that infect a wide range of hosts and cause various diseases, including preventable blindness in developing countries, sexually transmitted disease and pneumonia. Chlamydia invade cells and replicate within a membrane-bound compartment, named the inclusion, that potentially serves as a protector shield against immune surveillance and also acts as a  filter  to exchange factors with the host cell. Despite the primary importance of Chlamydia as a human pathogen, little is known about the bacterial and host factors involved in the infection process. This paucity of knowledge is mainly due to the fact that Chlamydia is not a genetically tractable organism and to the difficulty of conducting genetic approaches in the mammalian host.  To further get insights into the mechanisms involved in Chlamydia pathogenesis, we have developed a genetic approach in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We have shown that Drosophila SL2 cells constitute a viable model to study Chlamydia infection. We demonstrated that, similar to the situation in mammalian cells, infectious forms (EB) of C. caviae, the guinea pig model of genital and ocular infection of C. trachomatis, enter Drosophila SL2 cells, differentiate into the replicative form (RB), replicate within a membrane-bound compartment and differentiate back from RBs to EBs. Using this model system, we have performed a genome wide RNAi screen and identify 450 host that when depleted increased or decreased C. caviae intracellular growth. We now propose: (1) to confirm the candidates identified in the primary screen, (2) to identify the host factors specifically involved in Chlamydia infection, (3) to validate the selected Chlamydia-specific candidates in a mammalian system. Altogether, our genetic approach should lead to the identification of uncovered host factors involved in Chlamydia pathogenesis. Our long-term goal is to characterize the function of the identified candidates in order to better understand the complex interaction between Chlamydia and its host and potentially identify novel targets for therapeutic treatment."
4148,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent clinical studies reveal that agents that activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have robust efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia as well as AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors lack true specificity for M1. This has resulted in problems with adverse effects due to M2 and M3 activation in patients and has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 or other mAChR subtypes. Despite major efforts by multiple industry and academic laboratories, it has been impossible to develop clinically useful highly selective M1 agonists that act the orthosteric acetylcholine (ACh) binding site. This is likely due to the high degree of conservation of the ACh site between mAChR subtypes. In recent years we have been highly successful in establishing a new class of compounds that act as allosteric potentiators of G protein-coupled receptors that may provide key advantages to direct-acting agonists. Unlike agonists, these compounds do not directly activate the receptor but act at an allosteric site to potentiate the response to the endogenous agonist. In general, these compounds tend to be more selective for the intended receptor because they do not interact with the highly conserved neurotransmitter binding site. Another major breakthrough occurred when other laboratories discovered a novel class of M1 agonists that interact with an ectopic site on the receptor rather than the ACh binding site. Unlike traditional agonists, these compounds are highly specific for M1 relative to other mAChR subtypes and provide exciting new tools to definitively determine whether the physiological and behavioral effects of mAChR agonists thought to be important for antipsychotic activity are mediated by M1. In the proposed studies, we will take advantage of automated technologies and a high throughput screen for allosteric potentiators of M1 that we have developed to identify novel compounds that act as highly selective allosteric potentiators of this receptor. In addition, we will use these compounds along with the new selective ectopic site M1 agonists, a novel M4 allosteric potentiator and a panel of mice in which specific mAChR subtypes have been deleted to test the hypothesis that the antipsychotic-like profile of muscarinic agonists is mediated by M1 and to determine whether allosteric potentiators of M1 have electrophysiological and behavioral effects that are similar to those of M1 agonists."
4201,HHS,HHS,"To meet the challenge of global AIDS, multi-level approaches to prevention must take advantage of newavenues of research and incorporate emerging technologies in outreach and communication, datacollection, intervention, and scientific cooperation around the world. More than ever, establishedresearchers are called upon to learn and use new technologies that increase their capacity to conductresearch with geographically dispersed participants and collaborators in the US and around the world.Both established and more junior investigators must be positioned to address emerging research needs,work within appropriate cultural contexts, maximize the use of new technologies, and effectivelydisseminate the products of their work. The Development Core will meet these needs by working withHIV Center investigators to stimulate new research and coordinate existing resources, thereby optimizingscientific output and contributions. The Core will improve the ability of HIV Center investigators,particularly new investigators to initiate new lines of investigation through a Pilot Studies program,grantsmanship training, and assistance with responses to RFAs. It will encourage publication by juniorinvestigators through a Manuscript Writing Workshop and a Publications Award. The Core willstrengthen the ability of investigators to conduct research in international and multicultural environmentsthrough an Intercultural Sensitivity Training. Given the rapidly changing, and still incompletely understood,role of emerging information technology, the Core will place a special new emphasis in the period aheadon maximizing the potential while avoiding the pitfalls of the Internet and other recent technologicalbreakthroughs. Therefore, another major emphasis of the Development Core will be to enhance thecapacity of HIV Center investigators to employ state-of-the-art information technology for data collection,outreach, intervention and scientific coordination to advance the HIV Center's social and behavioralscience research agenda. In coordination with the Statistics, Epidemiology, and Data Core, theDevelopment Core will provide consultations, demonstrations of new technology, and seminars about theinnovative use of information technology. Finally, the Development Core will assure integration ofpostdoctoral fellows and other trainees into the HIV Center with attention to access to Center Cores,faculty, and other resources. The Core offers a venue for coordination among several of key personnelwho work with fellows and other trainees, and activities of the Core will serve as a major point of entryto the broader work of the Center."
4240,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION: The family Rhabdoviridae has members that represent some of the greatest threats to human, animal and plant health, including Rabies virus of humans and animals, Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus offish, and Rice yellow stunt virus of plants. By comparing the functions of proteins encoded by different rhabdoviruses we hope to fulfill our long-term goal, which is to understand how new viral pathogens emerge via adaptive changes required for replication in different host cells. The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that phosphorylated  P  proteins encoded by plant negative-strand RNA viruses have novel functions, relative to the cognate proteins from animal viruses, which are required for the successful infection of plant cells. My lab has provided experimental evidence that extends the multiple activities of P to include that of RNA silencing suppressor (RSS). We have also made the novel discovery that this activity can be regulated by its interaction with a second viral protein. The objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanism by which SYNV-P functions as an RSS and how this activity is moderated by interaction with other SYNV proteins. Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the RSS activity of SYNV-P is mediated via direct binding to RNA. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that RSS activity is conserved among rhabdovirus P proteins. Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that the RSS activity of SYNV-P can be modulated via interactions with the nucleocapsid (N) or matrix (M) proteins. Additionally, our expertise in purifying N and P protein complexes from insect and bacterial cells will enable us to take advantage of an NIH-funded project at the University of Kentucky that could determine the X-ray crystal structures for these proteins. To date, the structures of the N and P proteins encoded by rhabdoviruses with animal hosts have not been determined. Therefore, if successful, the crystallization of any of these proteins, in homo- or heterogeneous complexes, would represent an important contribution valued by a large community of researchers from different disciplines. In sum, this research is significant for its contribution to the basic understanding of the molecular and cell biology of rhabdoviruses, particularly those of plants, and has the potential to lead to the development of novel control strategies for a variety of diseases."
4276,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Molecular Biophysics Graduate Program provides UCSF students with a unique opportunity to bring methodologies and approaches from physics, mathematics, chemistry and engineering to bear on the most sophisticated problems in quantitative biology in a stellar biomedical environment. The program emphasizes interdisciplinary training, and a hallmark of the program is the use of experimental and computational approaches to address fundamental questions in molecular function and cellular processes.  We feel it is imperative to train the next generation of scientists not only to understand the biology and structural biology but also to be able to synthesize vast amounts of information into quantitative and testable models. Reflecting these scientific opportunities and needs, we have expanded our efforts in computational biophysics while maintaining a solid emphasis on the physical basis for complex biological behavior. As a consequence we have changed the title of this application from  Structural Biology  to  Molecular Biophysics   to acknowledge the importance of training students in a broad array of approaches ranging from structural biology to computational chemistry to bioinformatics to systems biology.  To provide a more integrated inter-disciplinary training experience and specifically encourage disciplinary cross-over, our unique training program has evolved to focus on very rapidly bringing all students to a common understanding, breaking down sociological barriers to interdisciplinary research, building confidence and enhancing bonding within the entering class. This is coupled with our traditional strong emphasis on critical thinking, careful mentoring, building communication skills, and the benefits of collaborative research.  Relevance: The extraordinary complexity of biological systems ultimately derives from the properties of individual molecules and how they interact to form supramolecular machines and networks. To provide new insight into this complexity, the UCSF Molecular biophysics training grant will train a new generation of scientists to simultaneously understand the physical basis for molecular behavior and to have the tools required for integrating the vast amounts of available information into testable quantitative models of overall function."
4294,HHS,NSF,"The context for this study is an exhaustive empirical examination of a research-based andcomputer-managed treatment for adult developmental stuttering known as the Modifying PhonationIntervals (MPI) program. Within that context, the studies described in this proposal will test a number ofhypotheses concerning the relationships among several critical factors: stuttering behavior, the neurology ofstuttering, the cognitive and affective components of stuttering, stuttering treatment approaches, and themaintenance of stuttering treatment gains. Thus, this proposal simultaneously addresses two overwhelmingneeds: efficacious stuttering treatments for adults, and the integration of basic knowledge, such asknowledge about the neurology of stuttering, with information from treatment research to developcomprehensive neurophysiologic and behavioral models of stuttering and stuttering treatment. It ishypothesized that (a) a necessary prerequisite for durable treatment benefits is normalized cerebral bloodflow within regions that constitute an emerging model of the neurophysiology of stuttering, and (b) thisresult can be achieved by establishing a speech pattern that requires the production of speech with areduced proportion of short phonated intervals (Pis). These aims will be met in a treatment comparisonstudy that employs repeated behavioral, cognitive, and affective evaluations derived from the MPI programand a prolonged speech (PS) program that represents the current standard of care for adult stuttering. Thisevaluation format will be conjoined by repeated PET scanning, to identify specific speech-motor and neuralsystem changes generated by these treatments and described by an empirically derived stuttering systemmodel. Both treatments include identical transfer and maintenance components plus within- andbeyond-clinic assessments that extend over the course of treatment and 12 months after its cessation.Repeated performance-correlation analyses of the derived brain imaging data will test the principaltheoretic proposition that the system model regions functionally control the efficacy of stuttering treatment.The overall study also constitutes a Phase II treatment efficacy study that will determine the need for a Phase III treatment trial of the MPI program."

4338,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under normal physiological conditions, glutamate-mediated activation of excitatory receptors on neurons is transient. However, under pathological conditions, extracellular glutamate levels can become elevated, resulting in prolonged stimulation of the excitatory receptors, and leading to excitotoxic death of neurons. Five excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs 1-5) play a key role in insuring that excitatory transmission is transient by rapidly clearing glutamate from synaptic clefts, and the extracellular environment. However, under certain pathological conditions, such as ischemia, reversal of these transporters may actually contribute to pathology and neuronal damage. Thus, glutamate transporters have the potential to promote either neuroprotection or neurodegeneration. Contradictions exist in the current literature in regards to the contribution that individual transporter isotypes provide towards neuroprotection or neurodegeneration in the context of excitotoxic injury. The model systems used to study glutamate transporters have been primarily limited to transporter inhibition. Pharmacological studies have successfully identified a number of glutamate analogs that globally inhibit glutamate transporters. Very few pharmacological agents have been identified which enhance glutamate transporter activity and none have the ability to discriminate between selected transporters in a cell type specific manner. In contrast, our preliminary data strongly suggests that the expression of individual transporter isotypes can be either inhibited or enhanced in a cell type specific manner by using recombinant Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver selected glutamate transporter genes in either the sense or antisense orientation, under the control of cell type specific promoters. However, we have observed that gene expression is limited to focal regions within the CNS following stereotactic delivery of AAV vectors. Our goal in this proposal is to rigorously test this tool and determine to what extent functional transporter expression can be modulated and further develop this method to provide global, cell type specific transporter gene distribution and expression in the CNS through intracerebral ventricular injection of P0 rat pups with novel AAV serotypes. Relevance The development of this viral based gene delivery method will provide a novel tool which will permit the examination of glutamate transporter function in a way that has not been previously possible. This approach will allow us to directly test critical hypotheses regarding how individual glutamate transporter isotypes contribute to neuroprotection or neuropathology in diseases and disorders such as stroke, epilepsy and ALS. The development of these tools will also provide a solid scientific basis for future translational research involving the cell type specific modulation of selected transporters as potential treatments for disorders involving an excitotoxic component."
4342,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Balabanov is currently a Clinical Associate at The University of Chicago. In the next five years, he will perform basic scientific research in transgenic models of demyelinating disorders under the mentorship of Dr. Brian Popko. His experience in neuroimmunology and transgenic technology, the enviroment at The University of Chicago and the design of his appointment make him uniquely qualified to pursue this goal. Previously, Dr. Balabanov spent five years at Wayne State University performing research in neuroimmunology. His interest in autoimmune demyelinating diseases of the CNS further matured during his neurology residency and fellowship. In his proposed research, he will study the oligodendrocyte response to interferon (IFN)-gamma and will search for the molecular mechanisms of demyelination. The University of Chicago has established neuroimmunology, myelin and transgenic laboratories. In addition, a diverse and active neurology, immunology and molecular biology faculty provides a rich training environment and numerous opportunities for collaboration. Should he receive a K08 Research Career Award, Dr. Balabanov will utilize this supportive environment to continue his education, expand his technical capabilities, and complete a university curriculum in the responsible conduct of research. Under the mentorship of Dr. Brian Popko, Dr. Balabanov will carry out a five-year research plan to define how oligodendrocytes respond to IFN-gamma. He will study the molecular aspects of their response by employing novel transgenic animal models of oligodendrocyte-restricted expression of both IFN-gamma receptor and its signaling inhibitory molecules. His research is likely to reveal not only the direct effect of IFN-gamma on oligodendrocytes but also the patterns of intracellular signaling and gene expression associated with IFN-gamma-mediated demyelination. By studying the oligodendrocyte response to IFN-gamma with this novel approach, he hopes to address problems faced by many researchers in the field."
4354,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sarcomere protein gene mutations cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), sporadic HCM, pediatric HCM and HCM of the elderly and occur in approximately 1 million people in the US. The molecular mechanisms by which these mutations produce the clinical features of LVH remain largely unknown. We have produced mouse models that carry selective human mutations, characterized the development of histopathology, assessed candidate molecules for triggering hypertrophic signaling, and performed comprehensive (SAGE) transcriptional profiling early and late in pathologic remodeling of ventricular myocardium. Phenotypic characterization of genetically identical HCM mice demonstrated that responses to sarcomere protein gene mutations are complex, activating different molecular pathways in different myocytes within the same heart. These different cellular pathways must be activated by different environmental factors. The central hypotheses of this application is that different myocyte populations will be distinguished by different expression profile signatures and that definition of these RNA signatures will help to identify key molecules that are involved in directing each facet of the hypertrophic response. Our previous efforts to identify transcriptional signatures of HCM have involved using existing techniques to assess RNA expression in the entire left ventricle of HCM mice. Our initial efforts to identify RNA profile signatures were confounded by three technical problems: 1) Existing transcriptional profiling technologies did not allow assessment of RNAs that are expressed at low levels; 2) Cardiac tissue was treated as a homogenous cell population; 3) The response to sarcomere protein gene mutations varies considerably even between genetically identical mice. Here we propose two approaches to overcome the technical difficulties encountered in characterizing the hypertrophic response. First, we will isolate specific cell populations in which a particular molecular marker of a hypertrophic response has been activated. For example, we will use a marker gene in which the (3-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene promoter drives a fluorescent yellow protein to isolate cells in which this molecular hypertrophy marker is activated. Second, we have recently developed a modified RNA profiling method, we have termed PMAGE (polony multiplex analysis of gene expression), which provides about 100 fold more sensitivity than existing techniques. We propose to define the role of proteins whose expression is altered in different myocyte subsets. Specifically we propose to: 1) Isolate mouse myocyte populations with shared molecular responses to HCM mutations. 2) Employ a highly sensitive RNA profiling technique PMAGE to define RNA profiles in mouse myocyte populations. 3) Assess roles of signaling proteins in hypertrophic pathways triggered by sarcomere gene mutations. 4) Assess RNA profiles and screen candidate genes for mutations in human HCM samples."
4364,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 	This application describes the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Department of Medicine (DOM) HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) and two Clinical Research Sites (CRSs), one affiliated with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Network and one with the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN). The Administrative Core of the CTU will be located at the UCSD Antiviral Research Center on the UCSD Medical Center Hillcrest Campus. The UCSD CTU is affiliated, by invitation, with the proposed ACTG and HPTN Leadership Group applications. The ACTG CRS will conduct therapeutic clinical trials developed by the ACTG, targeting HIV-1-infected adult and older adolescent patients recruited from the San Diego County area, concentrating on studies in the high priority areas of translational research, new antiretroviral drug development, optimizing antiretroviral therapy and the clinical management of HIV-1 disease and its complications and co-infections, pathogenesis and treatment of acute HIV-1 infection and drug resistant HIV-1, and the evaluation of candidate HIV-1 vaccines as immunotherapeutic agents in individuals with chronic established HIV-1 infection. The HPTN CRS will conduct clinical trials developed by the HPTN, targeting predominantly HIV-uninfected but high-risk participants drawn from the San Diego County area, as well as HIV-1-infected patients participating in ACTG therapeutic clinical trials ( prevention for positives  initiatives) in collaboration with the ACTG. The HPTN CRS will concentrate on studies of antiretroviral treatment of acute HIV-1 infection to reduce transmission in this high-risk population, and of behavioral interventions to reduce transmission of HIV-1 and sexually transmitted infections in both HIV-uninfected and chronically infected individuals and their sexual partners. The CTU will initially devote 75% of its research effort on clinical trials implemented by the ACTG and 25% effort on clinical trials conducted through the HPTN, in order to accommodate the large complement of research participants continuing in ACTG studies through the transition period in year 1. These proportions will shift over time as new protocols are implemented and ongoing protocols are completed. Both CRSs will contribute scientifically to each Network through new investigator-initiated studies proposed in the new grant period in these research priority areas, and will further contribute to Network administrative and scientific leadership for both the ACTG and HPTN. The outcome of the proposed research will contribute substantially to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and to improving the lives of those already infected with HIV-1.       ADMINISTRATIVE COMPONENT:"
4368,HHS,HHS,"I will use a combination of experimental and theoretical methods to define the conformational changes at thenucleotide site of myosin associated with the interactions with nucleotides and with actin, along with therelationship of these conformational changes to the motility cycle. Myosin x-ray structures in the presence ofactin remain elusive, and must instead be extrapolated from actin-free structures. A central problem indefining the molecular mechanism of myosin remains to determine how the structure of myosin changeswhen it binds either weakly or strongly to actin, and whether additional important structures occur in the cyclethat have not yet been resolved. To address this question, I will use paramagnetic probes at the nucleotidesite to monitor nucleotide-state dependent conformational changes in myosin and those associated with theweakly and strongly bound actomyosin states. This information will be combined with distancemeasurements acrossthe nucleotide site using spectroscopic probes bound to the protein, along withbiochemical and mechanical observations of actomyosin function, as a further monitor of structuralchanges.In particular, myosin II, myosin V, and myosin VI have been crystallized in structures with very opennucleotide sites that are widely hypothesized to represent the actin-bound states of myosin. These myosinswill be investigated. Spin labeled nucleotides will also be bound to the crystal forms and the propertiescompared to in vitro observations, above, as an additional probe of whether the crystal structures, in fact,represent the actin bound forms, and whether they occur in the motor cycle. An initial analysis of in vitrospectroscopic and biochemical data suggests that they do not. Kinesin-family motors will be investigated asa model for myosin. A major effort will be devoted to developing more quantitative interpretations of EPRspectra in terms of protein structure using molecular dynamics modeling. Together these data will lead to amore detailed picture of how conformational changes at the nucleotide site are involved in force generation."
4414,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Iron deficiency represents one of the most common human nutritional deficiencies in the world but remains surprisingly poorly characterized with regard to its effects on organ physiology. One of the most prominent clinical consequences of this condition consists of a lineage-selective suppression of marrow red cell production, even in the face of high serum erythropoietin levels. The resulting blood abnormality consists of an isolated anemia, with sparing of white blood cell and platelet levels. The erythroid suppression by iron deficiency provides a rheostatic response permitting the adjustment of iron utilization in response to available stores. A further understanding of the underlying pathway has clinical significance for several reasons. Firstly, this pathway also contributes to anemias other than in iron deficiency, such as those associated with chronic inflammation, cancer, and renal disease, conditions marked by defective iron transfer from storage to erythroid compartments. Secondly, this pathway has been purposefully harnessed to limit neoplastic proliferation in polycythemia vera, where therapeutic induction of iron deficiency restrains the clonal expansion of the erythroid compartment. Thirdly, potential treatments or conditions that override this regulatory mechanism could precipitate clinical deterioration in patients with true, severe iron deficiency. Using a novel model system of primary human hematopoietic cultures with defined levels of transferrin saturation, critical signaling targets in this pathway have been identified. In particular, clinically relevant levels of iron deprivation selectively inactivate, i.e. in an erythroid lineage-specific manner, the signaling activity of a specific class of enzymes. This effect occurs through functional inactivation of specific prosthetic groups within these enzymes and not through diminished protein expression. A retroviral genetic screen has identified a specific factor which acts upstream of these enzymes and confers on erythroid progenitors complete resistance to the effects of physiologic iron deprivation. A small molecule agonist which acts downstream of these enzymes has been identified and specifically reverses the erythroid inhibitory effects of iron deprivation. In addition, a related small molecule antagonist recapitulates the effects of iron deprivation in erythroid cultures with adequate iron levels. The goals of this project are to delineate further the molecular pathway that links iron deprivation to lineage specific regulation of erythroid development and to study in a murine model system the in vivo consequences of manipulating this pathway. These studies will potentially provide new treatment approaches for many chronic anemias resistant to erythropoietin therapy, as well as a novel means for controlling erythropoiesis in patients with polycythemia. Project Narrative: Iron deficiency represents a frequent cause of anemia and causes the bone marrow to decrease production of red blood cells. In addition to iron deficiency anemia, anemias associated with cancer, kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and aging also are associated with impaired red cell production by the bone marrow. These latter anemias arise in part because of inadequate transport of iron from storage cells to the red cell precursors in the marrow. In particular, red cell precursors sense an iron deficiency even though total body iron stores are frequently increased. This project has identified the mechanisms by which bone marrow cells sense iron availability and adjust red cell production accordingly. Preliminary studies have led to compounds which can either reverse or mimic the response of marrow cells to diminished iron availability. These studies therefore offer novel approaches for the treatment of several types of chronic anemia and for the treatment of diseases associated with excessive red cell production such as polycythemia."
4418,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Trauma is a leading health and social issue in the United States. Our proposed postdoctoral training program fulfills a serious national need in trauma research, with aims to develop and evaluate new monitoring strategies, novel methods of resuscitation, immunomodulation and hemostasis based on targets in clinically-relevant laboratory models of civilian and military trauma that can help translate the laboratory findings to the bedside. This postdoctoral training program in trauma is dedicated to translating new ideas from bench top to bedside. Each trainee will complete a 2-year fellowship and a Master's of Science in Clinical Investigation with a total of 10 trainees completing the program over the 5- year project period. The training program will be supported by the Trauma Institute of San Antonio, Texas (TRISAT) member institutions; an established congressionally-supported clinical cooperative of the city's three Level I trauma centers and United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), a unique research laboratory in the Department of Defense (DOD) dedicated entirely to improving combat casualty care. The UTHSCSA Department of Surgery and the TRISAT consortium are uniquely qualified to fill the existing training gap for three reasons. First, the TRISAT consortium serves a large patient population (more than 8,000 trauma cases per year) with the physical resources and a highly qualified and dedicated staff of surgeons, scientists, and other experts who span a broad spectrum of topics related to trauma and critical care. Second, the TRISAT trauma hospitals work with the UTHSCSA to help improve battlefield readiness and outcome of trauma combat surgical care. Third, the UTHSCSA has had a long, successful history of translational research in other fields related to injury, ischemia and inflammation, including infectious disease, oncology, imaging, dentistry, and aging and several researchers in these disciplines have committed to mentor the postdoctoral trainees in their basic and clinical laboratories. The UTHSCSA Surgery Department has committed to training all residents in translational research for two years (following the second year of residency) as well as requiring that all residents complete the Master's of Science in Clinical Investigation. We must have a well-trained cadre of physician-scientists in critical care and trauma research if we are going to have improved outcomes and reduce mortality from trauma. Filling the current national gap in training is especially important because trauma is a leading health and social issue in the U.S. In fact, trauma exceeds years of life lost from cancer and heart disease combined and results in annual cost of over $260 billion in the United States."
4420,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research program is to develop a novel optical fiber that will enable wavelength tunable, all-fiber, energetic femtosecond sources, and then demonstrate the value of the proposed laser system for biomedical applications. The innovation of the proposed femtosecond sources is based on a new class of optical fiber that was recently demonstrated, where, for the first time, a large anomalous dispersion was achieved at wavelengths below 1300 nm in an all-silica fiber. The proposed research concentrates on the development of a novel higher order mode fiber for wavelength tuning based on the concept of soliton self-frequency shift. Leveraging the highly mature and integrated techniques that have been developed for the telecommunications industry, we aim to create two  telecom grade  femtosecond sources that are truly robust and turn-key, and tailored specifically for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. This research program involves close collaboration between Cornell University (Dr. Xu) and fiber manufacturer OFS-Fitel (Dr. Ramachandran). The industry-academia collaboration proposed in this program strongly couples biomedical optics and the fiber-optic communication industry, creating great synergies between two seemingly divergent fields and providing new opportunities for innovation in biomedical research. The ultimate aim of this exploratory instrumentation grant is to establish a novel methodology for wavelength tunable, energetic femtosecond fiber lasers for biomedical applications.The proposed program, if successfully completed, leads to a novel, wavelength tunable, femtosecond fiber laser that will have a broad impact on biomedical applications of ultrafast technologies. There are significant practical advantages offered by the all-fiber configuration, such as compact foot print, robust operation, and operational safety in a clinical environment. The successful completion of this research program will make femtosecond sources truly widely accessible to biologists and medical researchers and practitioner."
4438,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is focused on two components of the translation apparatus that are responsible for the rules of the modern, universal genetic code. The code is established by aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by enzymes known as aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases. In these reactions, each amino acid is matched with its nucleotide triplet imbedded in the anticodon of the cognate transfer RNA. The enzymes are ancient and appeared at or before the split that gave rise to the three kingdoms of living organisms. Highly specific interactions between the synthetases, their tRNAs, and their amino acids are essential for the accuracy of and maintenance of the code. Standard protein-nucleic acid or protein-small molecule interactions are by themselves not able to sustain the code. Instead, editing reactions that are tRNA-dependent are critical for preventing errors of aminoacylation that would invade, or contaminate, the code. In the proposed work, genetic manipulations explore the consequences of disruption of the editing activity of a specific synthetase. This work includes investigations of the production of statistical proteins, where more than one amino acid can be inserted at a specific codon in an mRNA. Also, with the editing center of a synthetase disabled, the compensatory cellular mechanisms that can be recruited to clear errors of aminoacylation will be studied. These investigations will be extended to study the disruption of editing in mammalian cells and the possible connections to disease. Further work focuses on how nature has developed other mechanisms to preserve the integrity of the code, including the complexities found in eukaryotic cells where mitochondrial and cytoplasmic systems of protein synthesis appear to force changes in the rules for synthetase-tRNA recognition."
4482,HHS,NSF,"We have developed state-of-the-art methods necessary to observe tumor cell invasion and intravasationdirectly in rat and mouse mammary tumors, correlate these cell behaviors with metastatic potential andconnect these behaviors to the gene expression patterns seen in the migratory and invasive subpopulationof mammary tumor cells in the primary tumor. Furthermore, these methods can be used to characterizemicroenvironments that cause autocrine and paracrine-mediated cell migration resulting in the accumulationof cells around an initiating chemotactic signal, sometimes associated with blood vessels. This raises theexciting possibility that there exist self-propagating autocrine and paracrine loops that are tumor gradespecific and that operate in the primary tumor, and possibly secondary and tertiary metastatic tumors, givingrise to systemic invasion and metastasis. Extension of this new technology to human breast tumors willallow us to explore the variety of stromal cells and microenvironments in this heterogeneous human tumorthat are involved in invasion and metastasis, and determine if a cohort of gene expression changes existsas a common invasion signature that may have prognostic and therapeutic value.The specific aims of the proposal are: 1. Identify microenvironments involved in invasion in human breast tumors. 2. Determine gene expression profiles of invasive cells in human breast tumors."
4485,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of acupuncture, with focus on the local tissue effects of acupuncture needling. Acupuncture therapy involves manipulation of the subcutaneous tissue with fine needles inserted through the skin at specific points, termed acupuncture points. Recent evidence suggests that the connective tissue in the vicinity of an acupuncture point plays a critical role in the local tissue response to in vivo acupuncture, and that acupuncture needling initiates a mechanotransduction response by deforming the connective tissue and its resident fibroblasts. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an in vitro model of the connective tissue region surrounding the acupuncture point that can be used to investigate the fibroblast response to forces created by acupuncture needling. We will use connective tissue equivalents based on collagen and fibroblasts. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the effects of connective tissue geometry on the mechanical response of the tissue equivalents to acupuncture needling. It has been proposed that the organization of connective tissue at perimuscular fascial planes coincident with acupuncture points enhances the mechanical response to needling. We will establish an in vitro assay that mimics the perimuscular connective tissue geometry. We will replicate the tissue planes by generating a three-dimensional, fibroblast- populated collagen gel around rigid partitions. We will develop a microrobotic needling instrument to enable precise, reproducible needling and force measurement while also visualizing tissue movement. We will compare the response in the partitioned gel to that in identical gels without partitions. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the effects of tissue geometry on short- and long-term fibroblast organization and morphology using time-lapse videomicroscopy to monitor spatial and temporal changes in fibroblast distribution, shape, and orientation in both of the assays developed in Specific Aim 1. In Specific Aim 3, we will characterize key fibroblast phenotypic changes in response to acupuncture needling that are associated with mechanotransduction, including integrin expression, MAP kinase phosphorylation, and matrix turnover. An in vitro assay of acupuncture will enable further study of the biological mechanisms of acupuncture and may ultimately contribute to improved application of acupuncture therapy."
4486,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In nature, the photolytic conversion of light to energy is a common mechanism for driving chemical reactions. As an example, photosynthesis utilizes energy derived from sunlight to promote key metabolic processes in plants, while exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide. The purpose of the proposed research is to apply these physical principals to create an artificial system, composed of durable biomimetic materials, designed to replicate normal respiratory function. Despite vast improvements across the spectrum of health care in the past 20 years, there have been few substantial improvements in the care of patients with end- stage lung disease. While the death rate for most major diseases has decreased significantly, the rate of death related to chronic lung disease has actually increased during this period. As a result there has long been interest in the development of technology to replace severely diseased lungs. Since the proposed technology generates oxygen directly from the water content of whole blood, it avoids the need for gas-to- liquid diffusion membranes, pressurized gas, and gas cylinders, while retaining the full benefit of the red blood cell's ability to rapidly capture and transport dissolved oxygen. Our preliminary data has demonstrated the capacity to carry out photocatalytic respiration in blood flowing through a microchannel system, which is structurally and functionally similar to pulmonary capillaries. The overall goal of this proposal is build on this preliminary experience in order to develop a microfluidic scale device capable of carrying out artificial respiration powered by photocatalysis. Accordingly, our Specific Aims include the following: Specific Aim 1: Develop a photolytically active 2D microfludic device. Specific Aim 2: Develop metal oxide thin films with enhanced dissolved oxygen flux from the photocatalyst and reduced by-product carbon dioxide. Specific Aim 3: Determine basic biocompatibility of the microfluidic capillary system and photoactive components. It is anticipated that the successful implementation of this device in the clinical arena will have significant impact on the morbidity, mortality, and quality of life for the large number of children and adults with respiratory failure, as well as establishing an innovative realm of biomedical technology."
4488,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The use of computational techniques for making biological predictions of gene attributes or interactions serves an important role in the scientific community. Due to the rapid growth of available data, it is not feasible to perform every desired experiment using wet-lab techniques. Computational predictions can thus be used to prioritize hypotheses, permitting more efficient use of experimental resources. Existing prediction techniques often make use of similar information to the variable being predicted (e.g. when predicting a gene attribute, use other known attributes of that gene; or more commonly the guilt-by-association approach with other genes, such as sequence homology). A larger probabilistic model that makes use of more information is to be extended during this research, with the goal of utilizing as much available information as possible to heighten the accuracy of the predictive methods. In particular, the incorporation of multi-organism data, the analysis of  missing data  (i.e. unperformed experiments), and alternative modeling approaches will be studied. Furthermore, predictions that are interesting and novel will be pursued using traditional wet-lab experiments (either in-house or through collaborators) in an attempt to make discoveries of practical value to biologists (following the precedent set by the Roth Lab, e.g. the rRNA processing collaboration with Tim Hughes)."
4537,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is as abundant and as dynamic as protein phosphorylation in all metazoans. The dynamic interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate plays a key role cellular signaling, transcription and in the functions of nuclear oncogene and tumor suppressor proteins. O-GlcNAc also plays a key role in protecting cells from varied forms of stress, suggesting that the saccharide is important to tumor cell survival mechanisms. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the functions and interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate important to the oncogenic and metastatic phenotype.

4581,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intramembrane proteolysis is an important and widespread biochemical mechanism in cell biology: many membrane proteins undergo intramembrane proteolysis to become activated for signal transduction, or to be converted to poorly soluble amyloidal peptides that may cause human disease. The long-term objective of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of this mechanism through crystallographic analysis of specific membrane proteins that catalyze the reaction and of their complexes with inhibitors and substrates. Many intramembrane proteases have been recognized as novel and important drug targets for treating infectious and age-related diseases. The current application focuses on GlpG, an E. coli integral membrane protein of the rhomboid serine protease family. Biochemical, mutagenesis and crystallographic experiments are planned to study: (1) how GlpG interacts with class specific inhibitors in order to examine hypothesis that GlpG and other rhomboid proteases use a membrane-embedded Ser-His dyad to directly attack substrate, and to determine features of the protease active site that are important for catalysis; (2) how GlpG interacts with transmembrane substrates through complex structural rearrangements in both proteins, and which factors determine the specificity of this interaction; and (3) the mechanism by which an interesting structural motif regulates protease activity in the membrane. Recent breakthroughs in crystal structure determination of GlpG suggest that this bacterial membrane protein is an excellent model system for studying enzyme action in cell membranes."
4595,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This PPG renewal (years 11-15) remains focused on the lung vascular endothelium as a dynamic cellular barrier which is perturbed in inflammatory lung injury. The thrust of our work has elucidated the essential role of the endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeleton in vascular barrier regulation (disruption and restoration) as well as in diverse lung vascular processes (angiogenesis, apoptosis, etc). In this renewal, our outstanding group of gifted PPG scientists will continue to focus on the EC cytoskeleton as an essential participant in lung vascular barrier regulation. We will utilize physiologically- and clinically-relevant stimuli, incorporate genetically engineered murine models of inflammatory lung injury and explore genomically-driven protein targets. Project #1 will utilize state-of-the-art structure/ function studies of the non-muscle Ser/Thr myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) isoforms to extend our understanding of this exciting multi-functional protein as a molecular target in lung barrier regulation. As EC barrier-regulatory function is determined by cortical actin remodeling, Project #2 will provide novel information regarding the role of key actin-binding proteins (nmMLCK, cortactin, alpha actinin) and their cortical cytoskeletal linkages to junctional protein complexes. Project #3 examines the effects of mechanical stress (cyclic stretch) on EC signaling to the cytoskeleton in the context of barrier dysfunction/restoration via complex VEGF- and GTPase-driven actin rearrangement and focal adhesion remodelling. Project #4 will continue to provide its detailed examination of the NADPH oxidase as a target for regulation by the EC cytoskeleton. Project #5 will focus on the cascade of signaling to the actomyosin cytoskeleton evoked when c-Met, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is ligated by hepatocyte growth factor, a major barrier-regulatory pathway with strong potential for receptor transactivation. Supported by four highly interactive Cores (Administration, Tissue Culture/BioMechanical, Animal Models of Disease, Biophysical Imaging), we will utilize state-of-the-art biochemical, biophysical and molecular/genomic approaches that will not only likely provide the deepest understanding of the EC cytoskeleton and EC barrier regulation to date, but translationally define the role of EC cytoskeleton in critical biologic processes relevant to inflammatory lung injury. We anticipate our work will quickly facilitate development of new strategies and targets to limit the adverse effects of the injured pulmonary circulation."

The Administrative Core will faciltate scientific collaboration between Projects and Coresthrough regular lunchtime meetings. This PO1 brings together experts in cortical electrophysiology,intracellular signaling, neuroanatomy, higher cognitive function, and cortical modeling in order to tackle theproblem of aging cortical circuits from a multi-disciplinary approach. We have aspired to pair juniorinvestigators with more senior scientists to introduce new scientists to the field of aging research. The P01 ishighly interactive, depending on shared resources and multi-level analysis of brain tissue. A majorresponsibility of the Core is integrating data between Projects and Cores. Within-subjects data from Projects2-4 and the Histology and Animal Cores will be fed into the Administrative Core for multi-variate analysis byour statistician, Dr. DiPietro. We will determine how network strength, working memory, dendritic integrityand molecular signatures interact to alter cognitive abilities in the aging brain. The findings from this PO1 willbe provided to Dr. Xiao-Jing Wang for computational modeling of aging effects on PFC networks. Dr. Wangis an expert on computational models of PFC working memory networks, examining how modulatoryinfluences allow PFC networks to resist distraction.

4613,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transcription factors are generally the termini of signaling cascades. As such, they are the ultimate mediators of change in cell function resulting from changes in the cellular environment. Inappropriate or unregulated expression of transcription factors has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, AIDS, and Type II diabetes. As such, a complete understanding of the transcription factor profile of a cell at any time would provide an exquisitely detailed depiction of the current function of that cell as well as strong indications of functional changes that may occur in the future. Despite the importance of this information and its predictive value, few tools exist that provide sensitive, reproducible, and parallel transcription factor expression analysis. It is proposed to address this significant need, leveraging validated tools from genomics. Our proposed method will combine solution-phase detection of transcription factors with a PCR-based readout to achieve detection limits of hundreds of transcription factor molecules per sample. As we have begun to characterize the signaling events that occur upon administration of cytokines and fatty acids to hepatic cells, a model of Type II diabetes, we will use this system as a model system for development and refinement of the analytical technique. The specific aims of the proposed work are to i) quantify in vitro association of TFs to their recognition sequences in MB-cassettes; ii) determine the lower detection limits for measurements of individual and multiple TFs; iii) measure TF level changes following stimulation of HepG2 cells in culture.    Transcription factors are cellular proteins that cells call upon to respond to changes in their environment. Altered transcription factor expression is often a hallmark of a disease condition. Our proposed work will provide a better means of measuring global changes in transcription factor expression and, in turn, allow for greater understanding of and better treatment of disease."
4644,HHS,HHS,"Project SummaryThe goal of this work is to determine the three dimensional structure of the bacterial nucleoid and to gaininsight into the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of this highly organizedstructure. The precise organization has recently been demonstrated in Caulobacter crescentus. In a non-replicating cell the position of a chromosomal locus within the cell correlates with its distance from the originof replication. This order is maintained during replication, where newly replicated loci move rapidly anddirectly to the same relative position in the incipient daughter cell. To obtain a high resolution structure ofthe nucleoid, the three dimensional position of labeled chromosomal loci in the cell will be determined usingelectron microscopy and tomography. I will determine how this order is established by investigating the roleof DMA binding factors known to affect chromosome structure. Analysis of the DMAcondensation ability ofthe Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) protein will complement the genetic and cell biologicalstudies of this protein. This work will lead to a new level of understanding of chromosomal structure and themechanisms that couple chromosome replication, condensation and segregation.RelevanceDue to the continued emergence of drug resistant bacteria, there is a rising need for novel targets forantibiotics. The success of existing antibiotics is based on their ability to disrupt essential processes withinthe bacterial cell. Maintenance of the proper organization of DMAin the cell is critical, thus understandingthe mechanisms that govern the three-dimensional structure of the bacterial chromosome may lead to theidentification of factors that are suitable targets for new antibiotics."
4658,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The limitation of present assessment of response to therapy is that patients are treated for 2 months before tumor volumes are measured to reassess effectiveness of the drug. The goal of this research is to develop systems for the rapid assessment of cancer responsiveness and susceptibility to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by use of recombinant peptides that bind to responding cells. These aims will test the central hypothesis that non-invasive imaging of cancer response can be achieved by use of recombinant peptides selected from a phage-displayed libraries that bind within tumor blood vessels following treatment with TKIs and cytotoxic therapy. PET, SPECT and gamma camera imaging will be used to rapidly monitor the response of cancer to TKIs. One model includes VEGF receptor TKIs that enhance the cytotoxic effects of radiation in the tumor microvasculature. This results in apoptosis of the tumor endothelium and subsequent activation of inflammation and thrombotic cascades. Our preliminary data indicates that VEGF receptor TKIs enhance the effects of radiation within tumor microvasculature resulting in improved tumor control. Cancer susceptibility to TKIs has been evaluated primarily by tumor tissue sectioning and staining. This pharmacodynamic approach is not entirely feasible in patients with brain tumors and lung cancer primaries. For that reason, we have developed the hypotheses that recombinant peptides from phage-displayed peptide libraries can be selected that bind to apoptotic endothelium and to receptors activated in response to therapy. These peptides in turn can be labeled with internal emitters to provide a means of non-invasive monitoring of responsiveness to therapy. The physiologic response to therapy is seen within 24 hours of therapy, which provides a rapid assessment using non-invasive means. We utilized phage displayed peptide libraries to select peptides that bind within treated tumor blood vessels. We will study these peptides with the intention of monitoring tumor blood vessel response during therapy with RTK inhibitors and radiation. We hypothesize that recombinant peptides will bind to cells undergoing apoptosis and provide a means to non-invasively assess cancer response to TKI therapy. The studies of the RGD peptide pneumatic imaging of tumor vasculature response has shown that this simple amino acid sequence binds to activated receptor that is non-specific and achieves binding to other tissues in addition to tumor [Hallahan, 2001]. For that reason, we have developed recombinant peptide that binds more specifically to irradiated tumor blood vessels. In the present investigation, we will test the hypothesis that these recombinant peptides bind selectively to microvasculature of treated tumors."
4696,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  HIV-associated dementia (HAD) involves destruction of neurons and synapses. Although it is agreed that brain inflammatory cells, including brain microglia and invading blood monocytes, participate in this CNS-damaging pathway by release of neurotoxins, the underlying mechanisms to account for neuropathogenesis of HAD remain uncertain. We have recently found a novel class of neurotoxins released by HIV-infected mononuclear cells. Extensive background study shows that this neurotoxin family is found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HIV/AIDS volunteers and is closely associated with degrees of cognitive impairment. In order to uncover fundamental immuno-pathologic mechanisms of HAD, we will explore the HIV-elicited neurotoxin by examining its structural features, its mechanisms of action, and its ability to predict cognitive decline among HIV/AIDS volunteers. Further study will consider the effect of HAART on this CSF biomarker.  This work represents transformational research that will help to delineate an immune pathway common to HAD and to other forms of dementia and will contribute to the development of neuroprotective treatments, which do not yet exist."
4698,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases in the United States, inflicting more than 20.8 million people and expanding at epidemic rates in some areas of the country. The key diagnostic of Type 2 diabetes is the presence of amyloid fibers in the pancreas. These fibers are composed of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) and many in vitro and in vivo studies have linked them to the disease. Even so, the mechanism by which hIAPP inhibits pancreatic 2-cell function and insulin production is not understood. A growing body of evidence points to hIAPP interacting with the cell membrane as the cause of cell dysfunction rather than the fibers themselves. One piece of evidence for this hypothesis is that lipid vesicles catalyze fiber formation and in doing so become permeable and leak. Thus, it appears that understanding the disease mechanism requires structural characterization of hIAPP during membrane association, folding, and fiber formation. However, since the mechanism is both kinetic and involves membranes, conventional structural approaches such as NMR are difficult to apply. As a result, almost all experimental structural information comes from circular dichroism measurements, which provide only a rudimentary characterization of the peptide structure. It is not even definitively known which part of the peptide associates with the membrane. Considering the importance of understanding the structural changes of hIAPP with lipid membranes, we propose to use FTIR and 2D IR spectroscopy, in conjunction with 1-13C=18O isotope labeling, to yield site-specific structural information on hIAPP during the kinetics of folding in the presence of lipid vesicles. We will gain residue-level information on peptide association with the membrane, insertion and orientation, secondary structure formation, and test whether pores in the membrane form. The kinetics of structure formation will help reveal the catalytic mechanism for amyloid fiber formation. We seek to obtain a detailed structural characterization of hIAPP membrane catalyzed kinetics that is not currently possible with other techniques.

4722,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploration of novel antimicrobial drug targets is required for building a new defense against threats posed by pathogens with natural or engineered antibiotic-resistance. In our previous work, we used comparative and functional genomics to identify, prioritize, and validate candidate drug targets among the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of indispensable adenylate-containing cofactors. Nicotinate Mononucleotide Adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), a key enzyme in NAD biosynthesis, highly conserved in a broad range of bacterial pathogens, was chosen as the most promising target. The major goal of the proposed project is to develop efficient inhibitors targeting this enzyme in bacterial pathogens, potential agents of biological warfare, as prototypes for new antibiotics. To address this goal, we will use an integrated approach based on comparative structural, functional, and computational analysis techniques. A choice of NMNAT family is supported by our preliminary results, which include kinetic and structural analysis of bacterial orthologs and analogous human enzymes (counter-targets), and the first verified inhibitors predicted by in silico screening of compound libraries. Recently, one of these inhibitors was shown to strongly suppress the growth of gram-positive bacteria in culture. Our research work will be structured around the following Specific Aims: (I) Functional analysis of representative target enzymes. Cloning, overexpression, purification and kinetic analysis of 10 representative NMNAT target enzymes tentatively identified by genomic searches in NIAID priority bacterial pathogens of categories A and B. (II) 3D structural analysis of selected target enzymes and structure-based inhibitor design. An in silico screening of 3,000,000 known chemical compounds will be performed using structural templates derived from the comparative analysis of representative bacterial targets and human counter-targets. (Ill) Experimental testing, kinetic and structural analysis of enzyme-inhibitor interactions. A combination of computer-assisted modeling, virtual screening, inhibitory analysis, co-crystallization, and 3D structural analysis will be used for iterative optimization of highly ranked NMNAT inhibitors. Inhibitor testing will include ex vivo experiments in gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial models. In addition to setting the stage for the development of new antibiotics, this study will impact our understanding of an important class of key biosynthetic enzymes in the vitamin/cofactor metabolism of bacterial pathogens."
4765,HHS,NSF,"Project 1-lntraperitoneal PDTPI: Douglas FrakerPeritoneal carcinomatosis is a clinical problem which causes considerable morbidity and is uniformly fatal.Complete surgical resection is not possible, conventional radiation therapy is unable to safely treat all areasat risk, and systemic therapy with available agents is limited by drug delivery and efficacy. Intraperitonealspread represents cancer progression on a complex surface and all areas of the abdominal cavity are at risk.During the first grant funding cycle we have demonstrated that surgical tumor debulking to minimal diseaseand intra-operative photodynamic therapy can be performed to treat all surfaces at risk. There were clinicalresponses seen in this heavily pre-treated population but the majority of patients recurred within theperitoneal cavity. This initial Phase II trial using photofrin was limited primarily by low photosensitizerretention in tumor compared to normal tissues. Other potential problems include the difficulty in deliveringuniform light dose to a complex surface, and tumor hypoxia which may decrease PDT cytotoxicity.In the current proposal, Project I will address these problems by utilizing a second generation photosensitizerin combination with targeting agents to alter the signal transduction cascade in tumors. We propose toevaluate the second generation photosensitizer, benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) in combination with theEGFR inhibitor, C225 based upon preliminary data suggesting this will increase the therapeutic index of IPPDT. Initial preclinical studies will be conducted in rabbits including peritoneal PDT at increasing doses ofphotosensitizer with and without bowel anastomoses. A Phase l/ll clinical trial will be performed on patientswith peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian or gastro-intestinal cancers who have no other treatmentoptions. The initial phase of the trial will identify and optimal dose of BPD and light energy. A second phaseof the protocol will add C225 to assess response rates. In all parts of the trial malignant and normal tissuewill be analyzed for sensitizer concentration, molecular markers related to PDT response, and intraoperativelyfor optical properties."
4769,HHS,NSF,"PROJECT 4 : REAL-TIME OPTICAL DIAGNOSTICS OF TISSUE FOR PDT DOSIMETRY ANDTREATMENT CHARACTERIZATIONThe underlying premise of the proposed research is that clinical photodynamic therapy (PDT) dosimetry islimited, and that useful, minimally invasive optical instrumentation can be developed for in-situ dosimetry andtreatment assessment based on measurement of tissue optical properties, tissue hemoglobin and drugconcentration, tissue blood oxygen saturation and tissue blood perfusion. Over the past five years we havebuilt and validated new experimental tools for this purpose, and we began exploration of their potential inanimal models and human tissues during clinical PDT. Highlights of this work included the discovery ofpredictive correlations between PDT treatment efficacy, average blood oxygen saturation and blood flow inradiation induced fibrosarcoma (RIF) mouse tumor models. In addition we initiated optical propertymeasurements in the clinic during intraperitoneal (IP) surgery. Our new aims derive from this experience.We will upgrade our instrumentation for clinical and animal model measurements to gather moremacroscopic tissue information in-situ with greater speed and fidelity. More importantly, our scientificemphasis will shift to explore the potential of these tools to characterize tumor microenvironment broughtabout by biological targeting, and to develop dosimetric measures for PDT in animal models with and withoutbiological targeting (with Project 3); a byproduct of these studies will be correlation studies of macroscopicvariables with microscopic variables from immunohistochemistry. Finally, in collaboration with Projects 1 and5 we will assess dose heterogeneity, tissue hypoxia, and blood flow in human tissues (normal andcancerous) during ongoing human IP and pleural clinical trials. We anticipate this quantitative informationwill take us further towards rapid, minimally invasive, in-situ optical diagnostics for PDT."

With the guidance of a mentoring committee, whose members are Ariel Deutch, Danny Winder and David Robertson, all experts in catecholamine system physiology and disease processes, we have incorporated into this application the components we deem critical to the candidate's scientific development. The application will provide novel training in the area of transgene expression of norepinephrine transporter genetic variants in primary noradrenergic neuronal culture and genetically altered mice, including use of immunofluorescence microscopy, transport assays and behavioral analyses to understand the impact of norepinephrine transporter genetic variants. Under the career development plan the candidate will participate in courses and seminars to receive didactic training and has also arranged to serve as instructor in several Vanderbilt courses. Vanderbilt University offers a superior environment to conduct the activities under this award, including core facilities for transgenic mouse production, mouse behavioral analysis and confocal microscopy.

Relevance: The norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET), is a mediator of NE inactivation by reuptake of NE into cells and may play a role in disorders of cardiovascular function, attention, memory and mood. Variation in NET genetic sequence, leading to altered NET protein, has been identified in humans.

4792,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Long distance retrograde signaling from nerve endings to the soma is required for Neurotrophin-mediated cell survival and the control of neuronal phenotype. Despite its great importance, fundamental questions about this signaling process, which involves formation and transport of signaling endosomes, remain unresolved. Some issues are highly contested, such as how persistent, long-distance signaling can be achieved by an endosome-based system. A potential resolution was provided recently by our lab that pointed to involvement of a novel, specialized endocytotic pathway for neurotrophins and their Trk receptors. Dissecting this newly identified Neurotrophin/Trk signaling pathway and its role in retrograde axonal signaling is the primary focus of this grant. At the heart of this signaling pathway is the novel protein Pincher (Pinocytic Chaperone) identified in our lab. Pincher mediates the primary retrograde signaling pathway for NGF and the other neurotrophin Trk receptors, but not other receptor tyrosine kinases. EGF for example, which unlike NGF does not mediate long-distance neuronal survival, utilizes the classic short-lived, clathrin-mediated endosomal pathway that is Pincher-independent. We plan to definitively show that the EGF and NGF signaling pathways are distinct at the level of endosomes and, further, to identify the Pincher-associated proteins that account for these differences. To achieve this goal we propose three specific aims: (1) Identify the molecular components, and their functional roles, in Pincher/TrkA endosomes in the cell soma (2) Identify the molecular blueprint of Pincher/Trk endosomes at distinct stages in the retrograde transport pathway (3) Determine the relative contributions of clathrin and Pincher associated proteins to neuronal survival. Our studies are directly relevant to both Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, wherein retrograde trophic support is defective and/or restoration of such support can be therapeutic in preventing neuronal loss and dysfunction. An understanding of the mechanisms for trophic factor signaling and delivery as proposed is essential to the rational design of therapeutics for combating these and other related diseases."
4812,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  The purpose of this proposal is to provide Dr. B. Paige Lawrence with release time from teaching, service and administrative duties, enabling her to devote at least 75% of her professional efforts to her research and career development.  Dr. Lawrence is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Washington State University.  She has obtained funding from NIEHS and the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation for her research program, studying the immunotoxicity of the pollutant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).  Dr. Lawrence's career development plan includes:  1) devoting additional time to defining the molecular mechanisms that underlie the immunotoxicity of TCDD, 2) expanding the breadth of her program in terms of immunological endpoints, experimental system and methodology, and toxicant studied; and 3) obtaining further training in immunology so that cutting-edge technology and information can be applied to her immunotoxicology research program.  To accomplish these goals, she has proposed a project that will direct her research program into an area that is new to her (immunology memory).  She will receive training and mentoring from Dr. David L. Woodland, a senior immunologist with expertise in immune memory to respiratory viral infections.  This award will allow her to travel to Dr. Woodland's laboratory at the Trudeau Institute in Saranac Lake, NY, where she will receive hands-on training at a state-of-the-art immunology research facility.  Given that there is essentially no information on the long-term effect of exposure to AhR ligands on the establishment, maintenance, and recall of T cell memory, the proposed studies will not only expand Dr. Lawrence's training, but will fill a very large gap in knowledge about the immunotoxicity of TCDD and related AhR ligands.  Dr. Lawrence's long-term career objectives include an academic career with research focused on understanding how exposure to Ah receptor ligands impacts human health.  She hopes to contribute to knowledge that will ultimately diminish the burden of environmentally-related diseases.

4820,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our recent studies have demonstrated that aldose reductase (AR), plays a pivotal rote in the detoxification of lipid peroxidation-generated lipid derived aldehydes (LDAs) and their conjugates with GSH.  4-hydroxy trans-2-nonenal (HNE), one of the most toxic and abundant LDA generated during lipid peroxidation and GS-HNE are efficiently reduced by AR.  We have further demonstrated that AR mediates the mitogenic and cytotoxic signals of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by TNF-alpha, growth factors and hyperglycemia leading to proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells, respectively.  We have also observed that inhibition of AR by specific inhibitors or ablation of AR by antisense or RNAi attenuates the activation of PKC and MAPK, phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha and activation of NF-kappaB and API.  Also, AR inhibition attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10, secondary messenger cAMP and prostaglandin E2 in mouse peritoneal macrophages.  Our hypothesis is that AR plays a pivotal role in the transduction of LPS-induced inflammatory responses mediated via ROS.  We will now systematically examine our hypothesis by investigating the release of LPS-induced cytokines and chemokines by mouse peritoneal macrophages and RAW246.7 cells and identify the mechanism(s) of inhibition of these cytotoxic signals by AR ablation.  Attenuation of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by AR inhibition will be investigated in the liver, spleen, small intestine, kidney, heart and serum, and correlated with attenuation of inflammation in tissues of mice.  Thus our aims are to 1) Delineate the involvement of AR in bacterial endotoxin (LPS)-induced cytotoxic signals in macrophages, 2) Investigate the role of AR in LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mouse macrophages, 3) Identify the molecular mechanisms and possible targets of AR and 4) Investigate the in vivo role of AR in the regulation of cytokine and chemokine generation and inflammation in mice.  Completion of these studies will demonstrate how AR inhibitors attenuate the ROS-mediated LPS and cytokine signals, provide a novel therapeutic approach for preventing inflammation-induced toxicity and elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) of AR's involvement in these complications."
4824,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases; V1VO-ATPases) are large, multi subunit protein complexes found in the endomembrane system of eukaryotic organisms where they function to acidify the interior of subcellular compartments. In polarized cells of higher eukaryotes, the vacuolar ATPase can also function in the plasma membrane in order to pump protons to the outside of the cell. The proton pumping action of the vacuolar ATPase is involved in a large number of intra- and inter cellular processes such as receptor mediated endocytosis, protein trafficking, pH homeostasis, storage of metabolites and neurotransmitter release. Given its widespread nature, it is not surprising that more and more diseases as fundamental as diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis and AIDS are found to be associated with a defective human vacuolar ATPase. We are studying the structure of this important enzyme by electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as other biophysical techniques. In the first funding period for this project, we have generated three-dimensional structural models of the mammalian- and yeast vacuolar ATPase. Furthermore, by using difference mapping, immuno labeling and fitting of X-ray crystal structures, we have been able to determine the subunit architecture of the V-ATPase complex. We are now proposing to extend our structural studies and to use a variety of independent techniques to obtain high resolution structural data for the mammalian- and yeast vacuolar ATPase and for the vacuolar like ATPase from Archaea. Furthermore, we propose to test a number of hypotheses regarding the mechanism by which the ATPase driven proton pumping activity of the vacuolar ATPase is regulated in vivo. The specific aims for this competing continuation proposal are: 1) to investigate the structure and function of the peripheral stalk(s), 2) to elucidate the mechanism of activity silencing in the V1-ATPase domain 3) to determine the subunit architecture of the yeast VO domain by electron crystallography. From the high resolution structural data for the vacuolar ATPase will hope to better understand the catalytic mechanism of ATP hydrolysis powered proton pumping and the mechanism of reversible dissociation/reassociation by which the enzyme's activity is regulated in vivo."
4840,HHS,NSF,"Our previous work has demonstrated that the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus is anaccessory virulent factor implicated in the attenuation of the type I interferon (IFN) response of the hostduring viral infection. This is mainly achieved by the N-terminal dsRNA-binding region of the NS1 thatprevents the induction of IRF-3, a key cellular transcription factor that when activated stimulates the IFN-betapromoter. Our recent results indicate that the NS1 of influenza B virus (less than 25% amino acid identitywith the NS1 of influenza A virus) also prevents the induction of IRF-3 but in this case this is achieved by theconcerted action of the N-terminal dsRNA-binding and the C-terminal non-dsRNA-binding regions. We arenow planning to investigate at the molecular level the mechanism of action by which the NS1 proteins ofinfluenza A and B viruses inhibit the activation of IRF-3 and antagonize the IFN response. Our preliminarydata strongly suggest that sequestration of viral dsRNA by the NS1, a potent activator of IFN synthesis, isnot entirely responsible for the IFN antagonism of these proteins, and identify two cellular RNA helicases aspotential cellular targets for the influenza A virus NS1. Both of these RNA helicases, RIG-I and MDA-5, haverecently been implicated in the induction of IFN through its ability to  sense  dsRNA and transmit anactivation signal that results in IRF-3 phosphorylation. We will now investigate the role that these cellularRNA helicases play on the IFN antagonist function of the NS1 of influenza A virus and on modulation ofvirulence. In addition, we have designed experiments to understand the similarities and differences betweenthe NS1 proteins of influenza A and B viruses with respect to their ability to inhibit the IFN response and topromote viral replication in the host. Our proposed experiments will generate novel information that not onlywill increase our knowledge on how influenza viruses disarm the antiviral IFN response, but that will alsocontribute to a better understanding on the role that cellular RNA helicases play in the initiation of the IFNresponse. Since the NS1 proteins are one of the determinants of virulence of influenza viruses, our proposalfalls under one of the High-Priority Influenza Research Areas of the NIAID Biodefense Research Program:Determination of molecular basis of virulence of influenza viruses."
4844,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Control of infection with intracellular pathogens depends on the ability of the innate immune response to limit microbial replication and injury in the initial days of infection and then to efficiently facilitate the development of adaptive (antigen-specific) immunity. The innate immune system has an inherent ability to discriminate between microbial pathogens and self, a function fulfilled in part by toll-like receptors (TLRs). In addition to their important role in activating innate defenses, TLRs are thought to play an essential role in the activation of dendritic cells (DCs), which link innate and adaptive immunity, influencing the quality and magnitude of the antigen-specific immune response and the outcome of the infection. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing Th1 CD4+T cells and cytotoxic CD8+T cells are key components of protective antigen-specific immunity to intracellular pathogens. This proposal addresses the role of TLRs in innate immunity and in the activation of DCs leading to the induction of antigen-specific immunity to the intracellular bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), and the mechanisms by which IFN-gamma is regulated in the context of this infection. Lm is a food-borne pathogen that causes severe disease in the fetus and newborn infant, and the murine model of Lm infection provides a robust system in which to address mechanisms linking innate and adaptive immunity in adults and neonates. Aim 1. Determine which TLRs contribute and the cumulative role of TLRs in the innate immune response to Lm. Aim 2. Determine the cumulative role of TLRs and MyD88 in activating DCs and in linking innate to adaptive immunity to Lm. Aim 3. Determine whether deficits in TLR/Myd88-dependent or -independent mechanisms impair the development of T cell-mediated immunity to and protection from Lm in the neonate. Aim 4. Determine the importance of conserved non-coding sequences (CSE1/2) in proper expression of IFN-gamma in the context of the immune response to Lm. These studies will provide insights into mechanisms for host defense against Lm and for the greater susceptibility of the neonate to this and related intracellular bacterial pathogens."
4846,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow provide, through a tightly regulated process of differentiation and proliferation, lifelong production of blood cells. With age however, striking changes occur in the hematopoietic system. One of these changes involves lymphopoiesis. Here, we focus on age-related changes in B-cell development, which is characterized by a loss of early B-cell precursors. The severe age-related depletion of early B-cell precursors, and especially of pre-B cells, is not accompanied by a decline in the peripheral B cell pool, although it has been proposed that a loss of follicular B cells is compensated for by an increase in marginal zone B cells in aged mice. A coherent explanation for age-related changes in B-cell development and in the peripheral B cell pool was lacking thus far. We show here that with age, an alternative B-cell development pathway emerges where an identifiable pre-B cell phase is absent. This pathway originates from a population of Iin-sca1? (LSK-) cells in the bone marrow. The age-related emergence of this alternative B-cell development pathway may provide a unifying explanation for the thus far almost inexplicable patterns of depletion of B-cell precursor populations in aged mice, together with maintenance of mature B cells and changes in antibody repertoire. Here, we propose to analyze this pathway functionally and phenotypically, and to delineate its biological significance. The specific aims are: Specific aim 1: To elucidate the differentiation pathway from LSK cells to B cells; Specific aim 2: To investigate the mechanism of LSK- generation and differentiation; Specific aim 3: To examine the biological significance of the LSK- pathway."
4892,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Entamoeba histolytica infects approximately 1% of the world's population, and causes up to 100,000 deaths annually. The disease-causing trophozoite stage of the parasite differentiates into the infectious cyst form while within the host colon, and the stimuli that induce this differentiation are only now becoming clear. We had previously found that galactose-terminated molecules, including those in colonic mucus, are used by the trophozoites to form cellular aggregates just prior to cyst formation. We have now found that short chain fatty acids, which are produced by the resident colonic bacterial population, can regulate the Entamoeba cyst formation process in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of short chain fatty acids on the parasites are different from the effects these compounds have on other cells of the host, but they may be working through similar molecular mechanisms. This project will examine the mechanism(s) whereby these compounds regulate cyst formation, and will determine the extent of the effects these compounds have on gene and protein expression in the parasite."
4932,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quality control (QC) of glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) involves the interplay of a glucosyltransferase (GT) that only glycosylates not properly folded glycoprotein conformers, glucosidase II that removes residues added by GT and two ER resident lectins (calnexin, CNX and calreticulin, CRT) that specifically recognize monoglucosylated glycoproteins. This mechanism prevents exit of not properly folded glycoproteins to the Golgi and enhances glycoprotein folding efficiency and is directly related to the so-called  conformational diseases . To continue our characterization of the structural features that determine the participation of GT in the QC mechanism we now propose to study: (i) the subtle conformational differences, including those that may eventually result in the formation of amyloid fibers, that determine whether glycoproteins are recognized or not in vivo by GT; (ii) the maximum distance between the N-glycan and the structural distortion that allows GT-mediated glucosylation and (iii) whether glycoprotein structural stability determines its fate in the ER, i.e. successfully passing through the QC or being diverted to ER associated degradation (ERAD). For this purpose, we will express several N-glycosylation and stability lysozyme mutants (including some ones leading to the production of amyloids) in S. pombe cells and to follow whether they are recognized by GT, and whether they successfully fold or if, alternatively, they are derived to ERAD. These data, coupled to a structural characterization of the lysozyme mutants will provide information on why cells fail, in certain instances, to derive dangerous, aggregation-prone glycoproteins to degradation and on whether the structural stability of glycoproteins determines their fate in the ER. To continue our characterization of the role of N-glycans on ERAD we will further study the mechanism by which the ER mannosidase, the putative lectins Htm1p/Mnl1p/EDEM and Yos9p and the conformational sensor GT participate in driving irreparably misfolded glycoproteins to degradation. As a model system we chose S. pombe, a yeast that, contrary to what happens in S. cerevisiae, has a QC of glycoprotein folding similar to that occurring in mammalian cells. We plan to further study the proposal, derived from our own results, that the role of ER 1-mannosidase in ERAD is related to a putative lectin capacity of the protein and not to its enzymatic activity and to evaluate the relative importance in both productive glycoprotein folding and in diversion to ERAD of the first, partial glycan deglucosylation-dependent and of the following, reglucosylation, GT-dependent, CNX-glycoprotein interactions."
4975,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A collaboration between Vanderbilt University and the U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC) at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds will develop a wide-spectrum, activity-detection technology that employs multiphasic sensing, in order to provide a biofunctional signature of a CBW agent, unknown drug, or other threat. The signatures will be used with advanced algorithms to discriminate between different agents acting on a set of target cell lines. The proposed approach is extraordinarily versatile and general, because we are measuring the biological impact of the toxins, rather than simply their presence. This will address a critically important and as-yet-unmet need for diagnostic tools capable of identifying the mechanism of action of unknown or reengineered threat agents that defy accurate detection by existing, agent-specific sensors. The diagnostic tools will be created to establish signatures of key changes in metabolic and signaling pathways that occur in cell lines responsive to Anthrax, Ricin, Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB), and Clostridium Botulinum toxins. The interaction of the toxins with cells leads to a multitude of metabolic and signaling events, as toxins disrupt normal cellular functions in specific and non-specific ways that are not yet fully understood. To provide a means to characterize the effects of unknown toxins, the proposed diagnostic system will monitor key parameters of specific metabolic and signaling pathways over a spectrum of time- and volume-scales.  Newly developed well-plate protocols for end-point metabolic rates will be coupled with commercial fluorescence assays for signaling events. Additionally, the same metabolic and signaling events will be captured as dynamic biosignatures using a modified Cytosensor that simultaneously monitors multiple analytes on the time scale of minutes.  This approach will be scaled down to achieve dynamic resolution on the order of seconds in a microfabricated NanoPhysiometer. This approach should find wide application in the discovery of new drugs and unexpected and/or undesired physiological activity; environmental and industrial toxicology; metabonomics and signaling; and screening of countermeasures, therapies, and prophalaxis for pathogenic bacteria and toxins."
5031,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of frascati, a novel mitochondrial solute transporter (SLC25), in vertebrate erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. Acquired and congential defects in iron metabolism from either deficiency or excess are one of the most common medical diseases. Mutations in the zebrafish frascati gene lead to a profound hypochromic anemia and a developmental arrest at the pro- erythroblast stage. Using a positional cloning strategy, we showed that frascati encodes a member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family. The frascati gene (mitoferrin, slc25a37) is highly expressed in fetal and adult hematopoietic tissues of zebrafish and mouse. We hypothesize that frascati is responsible for delivering iron to the mitochondria, and in particular, the mitochondria of developing erythroid cells. The goal of this application is to test this hypothesis. We propose to accomplish this goal by the following two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Analysis of the biochemical function of the frascati gene. 1.1 The role of the frascati gene in mitochondrial iron acquisition will be studied using immortalized cells and zebrafish embryos deficient in frascati activity. 1.2 The physiologic substrate and transport properties of the frascati mitochondrial transporter will be studied by expression of recombinant protein as inclusion bodies in E. coli and their reconstitution in proteoliposomes. Specific Aim 2: Analysis of the frascati gene in mammalian organisms. 2.1 The function of the frascati gene in mouse will be studied by targeted gene disruption. Insight into the function of the frascati gene will be directly relevant to our understanding of human disorders of iron deficiency anemia and iron-overload."
5054,HHS,NSF,"The ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminalresidue. We have previously reported UBR1 and UBR2 as its functionally overlapping E3s and elucidated their invivo roles using mouse knockout approach. Unexpectedly, although both UBR1 and UBR2 strongly bound toN-degrons, UBR1'^'UBR2^' cells still retained the N-end rule E3 activities, indicating the presence of yetunidentified N-recognins (N-degron-Recognizing E3s). The goal of this study is to identify and characterizeN-recognins and their substrates and to elucidate the physiological meaning of their E3-substrate interaction. Toidentify mammalianN-recognins, we developed a novel affinity-based proteomic approach using synthetic peptidesbearing N-degron, yielding a novel 570 kDa-protein named UBR4 and a 300 kDa-E3 ligase EDO (termed UBR5).UBR1, -2, -4, and -5 shared a zinc finger-like domain named the UBR box. Mammalian genome appearsto encodeseven UBR proteins, named UBR1 through UBR7. Further, by using a functional proteomic approach, we haveobtained -35 candidate N-end rule substrates from -14,000 different proteins expressed in the rabbit reticulocytelysates. Preliminary characterization of candidate substrates unveiled several novel in vivo N-end rule substrates(RGS4, RGS5, RGS16, and CDC6), the first to be identified in mammals. To further extend our currentunderstanding of the N-end rule pathway, we propose the following Aims. Aim 1. To characterize UBR boxproteins as candidate N-recoqnins. We will examine: 1) proteolysis of model N-end rule substrates in UBR mutantcells, 2) the interaction and specificity of UBR box proteins with N-degrons, and 3) in vitro ubiquitylation of modelsubstrates by UBR box proteins. Aim 2. To determine whether UBR box motif is the recognition domain forN-degron. We will determine whether the UBR boxes of N-recognins are required and sufficient for direct bindingto N-degrons and identify essential residues for recognition of N-degron. Aim 3. To identify physiological N-endrule substrates. We will dissect proteolysis of candidate substrates in reticulocyte lysates and UBR mutant cells,determine the N-recognin-substrate interaction, and test whether N-recognins support substrate ubiquitylation invitro. Aim 4. To dissect physiological processes underlying identified N-end rule substrates. We will examine thephysiological significance underlying the N-end rule dependent proteolysis of RGS4, -5, and -16, emerging in vivoN-end rule substrates."
5077,HHS,NSF,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the microtubule-associated protein tau is hyperphosphorylated and aggregatesinto paired helical filaments (PHFs), leading to NFT formation. Previously, we described a cascade ofmolecular events associated with NFT formation within cortical neurons in AD. Whether similar or differentevents occur during NFT formation within cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) projection neurons during theprogression of AD remains unknown. The Program Project entitled  Neurobiology of Mild CognitiveImpairment in the Elderly  provides an outstanding opportunity to extend these findings to an early stage ofAD, people who have died with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Establishment of thiscascade of tau changes is paramount as NFTs provide a window into the tau portion of the neruonaldegnerationn in AD and will allow for in vitro modeling to approach a mechanistic understanding of taupathology and and aggregation. We propose to investigate whether formation of fibrillar pathologies follows adefinable sequence of molecular events that directly impact tau's assembly competency throughphosphorylation and truncation while other events (tau cleavage by Puromycin-Sensitive Aminopeptidaseexpression and non-canonical tau isoform expression) inhibit this process in CBF neurons during the earlystages of AD. We propose to place tau changes in an overall molecular context within affected CBF neuronsby correlating NFT evolutionary states with enzyme and other proteins expression profiles affecting tauassociation and function. Specifically: 1. We will test the hypothesis that CBF neuron NFT formation occursin a linear and orderly fashion assayed and ordered by alterations in phosphorylation and truncation eventsas certain phosphorylation and carboxy-terminal truncation events appear facilitative of NFT formation; 2.We will test for the expression of candidate enzyme genes known to stimulate or inhibit tau's ability to formNFTs defined by specific antibodies to phosphoepitopes, conformational states, and C-terminal truncationsites and, 3. We will test the hypothesis that the expression of small tau isoforms lacking the microtubulebinding repeats and carboxy termini inhibit tau filament (and hence NFT) formation. These aims will begin todefine the molecular milieu of tau tangle formation and provide insight into regulatory mechanisms involvedin controling and/or inhibiting this phenomenon, which are needed to develop new treatments for AD."
5085,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases transmitted from animals to humans are the most prevalent type of emerging infectious disease threatening human health. Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, affects more people than any other arthropod-borne (carried by insects or ticks) disease in the US. However, humans cannot be infected by all B. burgdorferi strains; the infectiousness in humans is strongly correlated with the genetic sequence at the outer surface protein C (ospC) locus of the bacteria. Of the 15 OspC variants found in the Northeastern US, only 5 are represented among strains isolated from Lyme disease patients. Similarly, each feral vertebrate species transmits a unique subset of genotypically distinct strains (ospC genotypes) to feeding ticks. That is, each vertebrate species in nature acts as a unique ecological niche that is infected with, and amplifies (transmits to feeding ticks), a different subset of the 15 ospC genotypes. Thus, the abundance of each genotype, including those that are infectious to humans, are determined by the composition and relative densities of vertebrate species. However the causal role of OspC in determining the vertebrate species a strain can infect has yet to be investigated. The major aim of this proposal is to determine if the variation in ability to infect vertebrate species, including humans, among genotypes is causally related to differences in OspC sequence. We will assess the causes and public health consequences of host selectivity of genotypes by integrating across three levels of biological complexity; molecular, organismal, and population - to address fundamental questions in Lyme disease ecology and evolution. Controlling the current Lyme disease epidemic via a human vaccine appears to be many years from actualization. Reducing the abundance of human-infectious ospC genotypes is an alternative, effective, and long-term solution to diminish Lyme disease incidence. However, intervention strategies to this end require a solid understanding of the basic biology of B. burgdorferi from the molecular to the population level. The long term goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanistic causes, both molecular and ecological, that contribute to human Lyme disease risk that could aid in the design of ecological control strategies or vaccine development. In the near term, these studies will lead to a mechanistic understanding of infectivity in vertebrate species; few examples are known of a functional basis determining the range of animal hosts a pathogen species can infect. From a global disease ecology perspective, this work is relevant as within population polymorphisms maintained by host species selectivity may be a prominent feature of the ecology of many emerging infectious diseases. In the near term, these studies will furnish fundamental new insights into factors affecting the natural abundance of, and disease risk from, animal-transmitted pathogens. Lyme disease is the most prevalent insect or tick transmitted disease in the US. Yet we know little about the mechanisms that contribute to invasiveness in humans or that escalate human Lyme disease risk. The long term goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanistic causes, both molecular and ecological, that contribute to human Lyme disease risk that could aid in the design of ecological control strategies or vaccine development."
5088,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telomeres, the natural ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes are specialized protein- DNA complexes that play essential roles in cell viability and genome stability. Gene integrity is critical to keep cells from tumorigenesis. Tumor karyotypes display three main types of alterations: loss of material, gene amplification, and chromosome rearrangement. Each of these changes could result from loss of telomere function in tumor cells. The long-term goal of my research is to understand the molecular mechanisms of how the human telomere executes its two main functions: to protect chromosome ends and mediate their replication. An improved understanding of the structure of human telomeres and how telomere protection and regulation differs between normal cells and cancer cells is critical for preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer. During the last decade, much information has been accumulated about the protein components of human telomeres. A six-protein complex, called shelterin, is thought to protect the telomeres of human chromosomes. TRF1 and TRF2 directly bind double-stranded telomeric DNA, POT1 directly binds the single-stranded 3'-extension at the chromosome end, and these are bridged through protein-protein interactions involving TIN2 and TPP1. The sixth protein, RAP1, binds mostly to TRF2. The shelterin complex associates with telomeric DNA and forms a key protective structure that is essential for telomere integrity and length regulation. Alterations in this structure correlate with the onset of cellular senescence in normal cells and tumor aggressiveness in cancerous cells. However, the molecular architecture and the regulation of the shelterin complex are still poorly understood. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the three-dimensional structure of the shelterin complex and to elucidate the mechanisms by which it organizes, protects and regulates human telomeres. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the shelterin structure at the single-stranded region of the telomeres and elucidate how the POT1-TPP1 complex protects human chromosome overhangs preventing unwanted events which could be catastrophic for the genome. In Specific Aim 2, we will characterize the detailed protein-protein interactions of the shelterin complex at the double-stranded region of the telomeres using both biochemical and structural approaches. The results of this work will help us understand how the shelterin complex is organized at the telomeres. TRF1 and TRF2 not only bind the shelterin proteins, but also interact with many other protein factors, especially those involved in the DNA repair pathways. In Specific Aim 3, we will characterize the interactions mediated by TRF1 and TRF2. In addition, we will also identify the optimal TRF1- and TRF2-binding motifs by random peptide screening method, which will help us identify novel TRF1 and TRF2 mediated interactions. Overall, the three specific aims address the structural and functional versatility of the shelterin complex from different perspectives. The proposed study should lead to novel insights into mechanisms of telomere end protection by shelterin, and provide us better understanding of pathways that connect loss of shelterin with chromosome instability. In return, this may benefit our understanding of the cause and mechanisms of cancer."
5133,HHS,HHS,"A key feature of healthy skeletal muscle is the ability to adapt to changes in fuel supply, a phenomenonknown as metabolic flexibility. Accordingly, in the skeletal muscle of lean individuals, exposure to lipidresults in the activation of a global transcription program that enhances the expression of multiple genes andpromotes the oxidation of lipid. Studies from our laboratory and others suggest that this adaptive responseis at least partially mediated by the PPARs, a family of lipid-activated nuclear hormone receptors. However,this does not appear to be the case with obesity, as our findings also show that fatty acid oxidation in skeletalmuscle is actually depressed with obesity despite elevated extra- and intracellular lipids that shouldpresumably activate the transcriptional machinery which promotes lipid oxidation. These findings suggestthat the molecular mechanisms which mediate the up-regulation of lipid oxidation are impaired with obesity,thereby contributing to a state of positive lipid balance. The central focus of this proposal is to test ourhypotheses that, A} fatty acid-mediated regulation of oxidative capacity is impaired in skeletal muscle withobesity (Aim 1); SJthat the mechanism responsible involves a defect in PPAR transcriptional activation(Aims 1 & 2) and C| that exercise training, but not weight loss, restores the ability to respond to lipidpresence and effectively oxidize lipid (Aims 3 & 4). These hypotheses will together test our centralhypothesis that with obesity lipid oxidation in human skeletal muscle is defective which is due, at least inpart, to an inability to respond to lipid presence and/or other stimuli (with the notable exception of exercisetraining) that normally enhance lipid oxidation. Our aims are: Aim 1: To determine whether lipid-inducedtranscriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid oxidation is impaired in skeletal muscle with obesity. Aim2\ To evaluate a possible cause-and-effect relationship between obesity-mediated metabolic inflexibility andPPAR function/dysfunction. Aim 3: To determine whether common clinical interventions restore lipid-induced regulation of lipid oxidation and/or PPAR function in obese subjects. Aim 4: To examinemechanisms by which contractile activity restores lipid-induced regulation of lipid oxidation in obeseindividuals. In lay terms, this proposal hopes to determine factors that may predispose individuals towardsobesity and how interventions (weight loss, exercise) for obesity induce their positive effects."
5162,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application to develop an orally available imino sugar for the treatment of flaviviruses infections of bioterror concern, with a focus upon West Nile Encephalitis virus (WNEV) and Dengue Viruses (DV). Our lead compound, the imino sugar, N, -nonyl-deoxynorjirimycin (NN-DNJ) has been shown to have efficacy in animal models of flavivirus infection. Although sound in mechanism, development of this compound was limited by formulation and toxicity issues. Therefore, a compound with a superior activity and toxicity profile will be sought. A new mechanism of action (MOA) and structure activity relationship (SAR) information will be used to rationally design imino sugars; we call alkovirs and glucovirs. These will first be tested for the ability to inhibit bovine viral diarrhea (BVDV) in yield reduction assays, since it shares the same step as other flaviviruses in the virus life cycle that is sensitive to the imino sugars. Compounds that show promise in BVDV testing will be selected for in vitro and in vivo testing against WNV and DV. If compounds are found that are superior to NN-DNJ on the basis of set criteria of selectivity and tolerability in tissue culture and animal models of DV and WNEV, they will replace NN-DNJ in the pre-clinical and clinical development path."

This proposal describes a 5-year trainingprogram designed to provide the candidate with the expertise needed to achieve his long-term goalof developing a career as an independent behavioral neuroscientist at an academic researchuniversity. The candidate received a Ph.D. in 2001 and has since been conducting research as apostdoctoral fellow in the Department of Animal Biology and the Mahoney Institute for NeurologicalSciences at the University of Pennsylvania. The Mahoney Institute for Neurological Scienceshouses over 180 faculty members from eighteen departments and six schools within the Universityof Pennsylvania and provides an ideal training environment for the candidate. The proposedmentor, Dr. Steven J. Fluharty, is a well-established researcher in the field of behavioralneuroscience and an expert in the cellular and behavioral responses to the hormone studied in theproposed experiments, the potent dipsogen angiotensin II (Angll). The research plan focuses onwater, salt, and food intake, key components of body fluid, cardiovascular, and energyhomeostasis. Understanding these behaviors as separate, but related forms of ingestive behaviorhas the potential to reveal novel insights into their control and regulation. The experimentsdescribed here are designed to determine the intracellular events associated with the hormonalstimuli for ingestive behavior. Angll receptors produce a diverse array of intracellular responses,yet the connection between any of these responses and the behaviors produced by treatment withAngll remains unclear. The experiments described here take advantage of novel pharmacologicalapproaches to determine the behavioral relevance of these divergent intracellular responses toAngll-induced ingestive behaviors and explore commonalities of ingestive behaviors in general.Project summary: Relevance to public health. Ingestion of water, salt, and food is critical formaintenance of homeostasis. Disorders affecting body fluid, cardiovascular, and energyhomeostasis include hypertension, heart or kidney disease, diabetes, and obesity. Determining theneural mechanisms through which hormones mediate these behaviors is critical for a completeunderstanding of the phenomena and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to combat therelevant disease states."
5179,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of the severe diarrheal disease cholera, which affects millions of people worldwide each year. The goal of our research is to understand the mechanisms for controlling expression of the genes involved in V. cholerae virulence. The V. cholerae virulence genes include those encoding cholera toxin (CT), which produces the characteristic symptoms of cholera, the toxin co-regulated pilus (TCP), which is involved in the colonization of the small intestine of the host, together with a collection of other genes whose roles in virulence are poorly understood. Expression of the virulence genes is controlled by a network of transcriptional regulators; however, one protein, ToxT, ultimately activates transcription of nearly all the virulence genes, and understanding how this protein functions is the focus of our work. Experiments described in this application will examine the following: (1) the amino acid residues in ToxT that are involved in transcriptional activation and DNAbinding will be determined using a genetic selection/screening followed by further characterization of mutants in vivo and in vitro. (2) There is mounting evidence that ToxT activity is regulated post-transcriptionally. We will determine how the post-transcriptional control of ToxT is manifested, examine environmental ToxT variants for functionality in epidemic V. cholerae, and assess the effects of constitutive ToxT expression in vitro and in an animal model. (3) We will determine the identities of all proteins whose expression is ToxT dependent by comparing proteomic analysis of V. cholerae having wildtype toxT and V. cholerae having a toxT deletion. These experiments should significantly increase our knowledge of ToxT protein function and of the functions of genes whose expression is activated by ToxT, and could lead to new therapeutic targets for cholera disease. Cholera remains a significant worldwide problem, particularly in areas suffering from the effect of war, natural disaster, or economic hardship, and improved treatments should greatly increase the quality of life for people in these regions."
5195,HHS,NSF,"The goal of the work proposed in this application is to decrease fat stores by increasing oxidation. Thehypothesis underlying this approach is that preventing inhibition of respiration induced by ROS will lead toincreased oxidation and decreased fat storage. Adipocyte respiration above basal is inhibited. However,scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), pyruvate or N-acetyl cysteine, can restore O2 consumption inrat adipocytes and decrease fat stores in human adipocytes. This was observed only in intact cells and notin isolated mitochondria suggesting that ROS production required the high fat environment of the intact cell.We have developed a novel long-lasting preparation of immobilized cultured adipocytes that permitsrepeated measurement of O2 consumption and image analysis of fluorescent molecules.To test our hypothesis we will use isolated rat adipocytes and mitochondria and differentiated humanpreadipocytes to perform the following Aims: Aim 1 is to determine if ROS removal stimulatesrespiration and decreases TG stores in rat and human adipocytes. The prediction will be tested thatthere is a relationship between ROS and TG stores such that decreasing ROS through over-expression ofsuperoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin or glutathione peroxidase will decrease TG stores. We willsimultaneously measure mitochondria! membrane potential (&W)and respiration to assess coupling. Aim 2is to identify the site in the respiratory chain that is inhibited by ROS. To learn the identity of the site,we will measure O2 consumption in adipocytes from substrates that enter the respiratory chain throughComplexes I, III or IV. Relief of inhibition will be indicated by increased respiration. Aim 3 is to determinewhether O2 , H2O2, NO or other ROS mediate inhibited respiration. Using submitochondrial particlesderived from adipocytes we will identify the inhibitory ROS species and their specific site of action. Flux willbe measured in the presence of ROSand site-specific substrates. Aim 4 will determine the mechanism oflow adipocyte apoptosis and turnover amid evidence of strong ROSaction in mitochondria. We willmap mitochondrial networking in adipocytes using photoactivation and test the effect of network alterationthrough gene knockdown. We anticipate that uncoupling between ROS and apoptosis is an essentialcomponent of adipocyte FFA handling.The anticipated outcome of these experiments is identification of the mechanism responsible for the uniqueinhibition of adipocyte respiration by ROS and ways to overcome this inhibition. Respiration in adipocyteshas been little investigated, due in part, to the misconception that it is not important. These experimentscould reverse the thrifty phenotype and possibly lend insight into the thrifty genotype and its role in thedevelopment of obesity."
5209,HHS,HHS,"The goal of this project is to demonstrate in a large, randomized clinical trial the efficacy of one or morepharmacologic interventions in measurably slowing the progession of Parkinson's disease. The majorsource of motor disability in PD is the loss of dopamine cells in the midbrain substantia nigra. Currentsymptomatic treatments improve motor function, but do not slow the advance of the disease over time. Aneuroprotective therapy is a treatment which protects or rescues nigral dopamine cells, and retards theprogression of the disease. After a series of pilot studies of candidate therapies, the clinical centers willembark on a large clinical trial involving an estimated 3000 patients with early PD, followed for five years.The end point will be defined in terms of clinical measures of disease progression.We are applying to be a clinical center for this project. A detailed protocol will be drafted by the SteeringCommittee, membership of which will include representatives of the clinical centers. A plan is presented forthe accrual and retention of patients with early Parkinson's disease at this site.Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegerative disease, affecting more than a million Americans. It is amajor source of disability and lost productivity. A treatment which slows disease progression by 50% wouldtake the disability which accumulates over 15-20 years, and extend it out over 30-40 years, improvingfunction and quality of life at each point along the way."
5216,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Cerebrovascular disease is the second leading cause of death in developed countries and accounts for high rates of disability. Current therapies for ischemic stroke [tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)] fail to benefit many victims due to the constraints of time to intervention, the significant incidence of treatment-associated hemorrhage, and the limited therapeutic effect of thrombolysis. Our long-term goal is to improve public health by developing ischemic stroke treatment approaches that overcome the limitations of current treatments. Guidelines for treatment currently focus on either (a) intravenous thrombolytic therapy within 3 hours of stroke onset or (b) intra-arterial mechanical intervention/thrombolysis within 6 hours. It has been recently shown in animal models that thrombolytic therapy may be enhanced by the addition of ultrasound. Furthermore, we hypothesize that combining ultrasound with intravenously injected microbubbles may facilitate mechanical disruption of thrombi in intracranial circulation without resulting in treatment-associated hemorrhage. We propose a pilot study that uses a rabbit model of acute embolic stroke to compare the utility of an intervention consisting of either 1] tPA treatment alone, 2] intravenously injected microbubbles with trans-cranial ultrasound, or 3] tPA treatment combined with microbubbles and ultrasound. We will explore the safety and efficacy of these various treatments for lysing three types of clots: fresh clots that simulate secondary clots associated with acute emboli during the window of therapeutic opportunity in ischemic stroke (Specific Aim 1), aged clots that are more typical of embolic clots that may not be fresh (Specific Aim 2), and insoluble embolic material more typical of atheromata (Specific Aim 3). Our ultimate objective for this pilot study is to test the refinement of novel treatments for embolic stroke that would yield a safe, simple, fast and successful therapy that can be further examined in future funded research projects and eventually applied in the clinical realm. Our proposed pilot study will determine which of these treatments is most successful, and future studies will further explore that treatment.  (End of Abstract)"
5230,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to examine the effects of ethanol dependence and withdrawal on dopamine (DA) systems in genetically defined mice. Using a repeated ethanol vapor exposure and withdrawal-stress protocol shown to increase drinking in a two-bottle choice paradigm, we have documented changes in DA uptake, biosynthesis and D2 receptor function that are consistent with reductions in extracellular DA levels in C57BI/6J and DBA/2 inbred mice. We will examine these parameters in INIA mutant mice such as the 22TNJ and others with extreme ethanol-related phenotypes as well as potentially an inducible 5-HT1A receptor knockout as an anxious mouse model. We will extend our studies into the effects of two or more cycles of ethanol exposure and withdrawal on dopamine systems, because greater increases in drinking have been shown following two cycles. Changes in DA system function during extended withdrawal will be studied; to date all of our studies have been on mice sacrificed immediately after ethanol exposure, and there is evidence that the dopamine system is low-functioning for weeks after chronic exposure to ethanol. Overall, our goal is to challenge the DA system with a combination of stress and ethanol and document the adaptations and recovery profiles that result. We hope to establish specific molecular relationships between stress and alcohol on dopamine systems in the brain. Relevance to public health: Alcoholism is a pervasive disorder, and this research will address some of the fundamental mechanisms that may lead to alcohol addiction. Finding relationships between stress and alcohol on adaptations produced in dopamine systems may increase our understanding of why alcoholics relapse during abstinence."
5231,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polyomaviruses are ubiquitous silent pathogens in a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans, but become opportunistic pathogens in the setting of depressed immune function. By early adolescence, nearly all humans are infected by both of the two known polyomaviruses, BKV and JCV. Reactivation of BKV is a leading cause of kidney transplant rejection and, in the elderly and AIDS patients, JCV reactivation causes the progressive fatal central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease called Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML also occurs in conjunction with immunosuppressant drug regimens. Recently, several patients treated with Tysabri, a humanized VLA-4 antibody that controls relapses in multiple sclerosis patients by restricting T cell immigration to the CNS, developed PML. There is currently no clinically effective antiviral therapy for polyomavirus infection, or the consequences of reactivation. Repetitive antigen encounter during persistent infection causes functional debilitation of virus-specific T cells, with clonal deletion the eventual consequence of chronic TCR engagement. The duration and magnitude of persistent viral infection govern the survival of memory T cells and their ability to limit viral replication. Thus, therapeutics that lower viral load will promote generation of effective antiviral T cell memory. Because of the narrow host range of this virus family, the mouse-polyoma virus (PyV) system provides the only tractable model to evaluate pathogenesis of and immunity to this clinically important virus family, and to develop and test novel therapeutic compounds. We recently found that Abl-family tyrosine kinases are required for replication of PyV and that inhibitors of these kinases (e.g. Novartis' Gleevec), rationally designed to control specific human cancers (e.g., Philadelphia chromosome+ chronic myelogenous leukemia), block PyV replication both in vitro and in mice. In this exploratory application application, we have combined the expertise of the Drs. Aron Lukacher (mouse polyoma virus pathogenesis and viral immunology) and Daniel Kalman (tyrosine kinases, Abl-family inhibitory compounds, virion-host cell interaction, deconvolution fluorescence microscopy) to investigate mechanism(s) of inhibition by these compounds in vitro and their capacity to limit PyV infection in vivo. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that Abl-family tyrosine kinases are involved in early steps in PyV cell uptake and intracellular trafficking and in replication. Because of the importance of CD8 T cells in immunosurveillance for polyomavirus-infected cells, and the detrimental effect of persistent viral infections on memory T cell survival and function, we further hypothesize that reductions in viral load mediated by the Abl-family kinase inhibitors will improve memory polyomavirus-specific CD8 T cell responses and further curtail polyomavirus reactivation (Specific Aim 2). Investigation of the mechanism of inhibition by these compounds and their capacity to limit PyV infection in vivo will provide proof-of-principle for their therapeutic use to counter polyomavirus reactivation in high-risk populations. Project Narrative: Nearly all individuals are infected lifelong by two human polyomaviruses, otherwise silent infections that have debilitating, potentially fatal, consequences in immunosuppressed individuals (e.g., kidney transplant recipients, HIV/AIDS). There is no effective antiviral therapy for polyomavirus infection. In this application, studies are proposed to explore the mechanism for the novel observation that compounds that inhibit Abl- family tyrosine kinases (e.g., FDA-approved Gleevec) limit polyomavirus infection, a critical prelude for their potential therapeutic use to prevent polyomavirus reactivation in immunosuppressed individuals."
5259,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is an especially difficult medical problem because it is a chronic disease affecting a patient's quality of life, often with no effective treatment. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of CRPS, thereby allowing new treatment paradigms to be developed, which is the long-term goal of this proposal. Using the spinal nerve ligation model, an extensively used rat model of CRPS (type II with major nerve injury), various aspects of the peripheral mechanisms of CRPS has been studied in the past, with support from the present grant. In the upcoming funding period of the present grant, however, the focus will be on spinal mechanisms of CRPS. The overall hypothesis is that spinal nerve injury induces a sustained elevated level of highly toxic free radicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS), in the spinal cord, leading in turn to central sensitization of dorsal horn neurons, which is the key underlying mechanism in CRPS. Four specific aims are proposed to test the following individual hypotheses: 1) that spinal nerve ligation induces an elevated level of spinal ROS, 2) that the increased ROS are associated with central sensitization and behavioral signs of pain, 3) that an important mechanism of ROS-induced central sensitization is impairment of GABA function in the cord, and 4) that as time passes many dorsal horn neurons die due to extended exposure to ROS. The present proposal is to test these hypotheses using a multidisciplinary approach. Successful completion of these aims will not only uncover important spinal mechanisms of CRPS but may also lead to the development of new analgesic drugs based on free radical scavengers."
5269,HHS,HHS,"The process of autophagy is a complex catabolic program for lysosomal degradation of proteins and othersubcellular constituents. It is important for normal growth control and is defective in a number of cancers.Beclin 1 gene is the first mammalian gene identified involved in autophagy. Mono-allelic deletions of Beclin 1gene are identified in 40 -75% of human sporadic breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. Homozygous Beclin1 knockout mice are embryonic lethal, while the heterozygous Beclin 1 knockout mice develop varioustumors. This mouse genetic result provides compelling evidence that autophagy plays an important role inpreventing tumorigenesis. However, exactly why the Beclin 1 gene and autophagy are critical for tumorsuppression remains unknow. The re-activation of autophagy may be an efficient cancer therapeuticstrategy. Preliminary data indicates that exogenous expression of the Beclin 1 mutant which mimicsconstitutive phosphorylation in MCF7 cells results in the activation of autophagy.

5275,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to be a major public health concern that has hit African Americans particularly hard. Individual-level prevention approaches, although effective, are too narrowly focused and ignore the role relationships play in HIV/STD transmission. Couple-level interventions, especially with serodiscordant couples, redirect the focus to changing the relationship factors that influence sexual decision-making and increase the likelihood that sexual risk reduction will be stable over time. This U10 competing continuation application seeks four additional years of support to meet the original plan to enroll 800 African American HIV serodiscordant couples into Project Eban, the NIMH Multisite HIV/STD Prevention Trial for African American Couples, that is being conducted in four clinical sites-Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia-in collaboration with the NIMH and a Data Coordinating Center. Although attendance rates at intervention sessions and retention rates at follow-up assessments have been excellent, recruitment challenges have caused slower couple enrollment than was originally planned. Additional time is needed to implement new recruitment activities that are anticipated to recruit these hard-to-reach couples. As in the original trial, we will randomize couples to (1) an 8-session couples-focused HIV/STD Risk Reduction Intervention or (2) an 8-session individual-focused Health Promotion Intervention (the comparison condition) that addresses health issues unrelated to sexual behavior. Both interventions involve couple and group sessions led by trained male and female co-facilitators. The approach draws upon the social cognitive theory, an ecological framework, an Afro centric paradigm and the applicant teams' previous work with African American populations. The primary behavioral outcome is self-reported proportion of condom- protected sexual intercourse; the primary biological outcome is the incidence of STDs (i.e., chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas) assessed by DNA amplification tests on urine and vaginal specimens. Secondary outcomes include theoretically relevant variables hypothesized to mediate and moderate intervention effects. Audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) will be used to collect data at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and mixed-effects modeling (MEM) will be used to test (1) the effects of the intervention on STD incidence and condom use as well as on mediator variables of these outcomes and (2) whether the effects of the intervention differ depending on key moderator variables (e.g., gender of the seropositive partner, length of relationship, psychological distress, sexual abuse history, and substance abuse history. The findings will contribute significantly to an understanding of HIV/STD risk reduction among African American serodiscordant couples, a population at high risk of transmission."
5296,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Graves' disease is one of the most common autoimmune diseases affecting humans, mainly women. In this disease, autoantib'odies generated by the immune system mimic the action of the pituitary hormone thyrotropin (TSH) thereby activating the TSH receptor on the thyroid gland and causing thyroid gland overactivity. Excess, unregulated thyroid hormone secretion leads to thyrotoxicosis with symptoms and signs affecting all organs in the body. Untreated, the disease can be fatal. Present therapy can treat but not cure Graves' disease. Moreover, there has been no significant advance in treatment in over 50 years. Recent evidence suggests that the molecular structure of the TSH receptor contributes to this autoimmune response. The goal of the present grant proposal is to enhance understanding of TSH receptor structure, particularly the extracellular region with which thyroid stimulating autoantibodies interact. The TSH receptor ectodomain comprises three components:- (i) an N-terminal domain (NTD) containing a cysteine cluster; (ii) a leucine-rich domain (LRD) comprising 9 leucine-rich repeats forming a slightly curved tubular structure. Each repeat has a beta-strand on its concave surface that forms part of the TSH binding region; (iii) a Hinge region bridging the LRD with the transmembrane region of the TSHR. The hinge is the least understood of these three TSHR ectodomain regions because of poor homology with other proteins of known structure. The TSHR hinge region is also unique among the glycoprotein hormone receptors in containing a -50 amino acid segment that is deleted during intramolecular cleavage into disulfide-linked A- and B-subunits. In contrast to the hinge region, the TSH receptor NTD and LRD structures are quite well understood because of the recent determination of the crystal structure of these FSH receptor components (lacking the hinge). However, the spatial inter-relationship between these three TSH receptor ectodomain components is unknown. The methodological approach to be used to investigate the TSH receptor will involve systematic mutagenesis of key amino acid residues chosen on the basis of present structural knowledge. The consequences of these mutations will be assessed structurally (using a large repertoire of monoclonal antibodies) and functionally (intracellular cAMP responses). The data obtained will provide insight into the pathophysiology of Graves' disease that will, hopefully, lead to improved forms of therapy in the future."
5297,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application to continue to explore marine microorganisms as a new source for antitumor-antibiotics. The proposed project would continue as a collaboration between chemists and microbiologists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, CA. and cancer biologists at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute in Princeton, NJ. Studies proposed for the renewal period include the following:     The isolation, cultivation and biological evaluation of marine microorganisms from diverse habitats. The focus of the renewal application will be on 7 new groups of obligate marine actinomycetes (Salinospora, Marinomyces, and the MAR 3-7 groups) discovered during the past 24 months.     Overall, to continue to isolate and describe new molecules, which show novel mechanisms of action in cancer-relevant, mechanism-based screens show in vitro tissue type selectivity in the NCI 60 cell line and BMS ODCA panels, and to subsequently investigate their in vivo efficacies.     To focus a screening effort on the new cancer relevant targets IGF-1 Growth Factor, DNA Methyl Transferase-1 (DNMT-1), Coactivator Associated Arginine Methyltransferase (CARM-1) and Ceramidase, and on yeast selective DNA repair and cell checkpoint targets.

5311,HHS,NSF,"Although peoples inability to make intuitive judgments about proportions (for a review, see Rothman &Kiviniemi, 1999) has been shown to lead to poor judgments about health related issues (Kaplan, Hammel, &Schimmel, 1985), relatively little research has been directed at understanding the cognitive representation ofproportions. The current proposal will fill this gap by (1) providing extensive data on the internalrepresentation of proportions, and (2) generating models of the cognitive representation of proportionssimilar to the models that exist for the cognitive representation of integers. The current proposal alsoaddresses the role of experience in the formation and maintenance of numerical biases. Learning how andwhy these symbols are misinterpreted will lead to techniques to reduce these biases, which in turn will leadto more effective methods of teaching mathematics. The proposed approach combines empirical research,numerical statistical procedures, exploratory analysis, and computational modeling. In particular, theproposed research will assess the distance effect for three numerical formats and three stimuli in whichquantity is inherent, assess the biases associated with cross-modality matching for the six stimuli, and usenumerical statistical models to estimate the parameters of the numerical biases. Once the functional form ofnumerical biases are identified and described, I will study the role of experience in the formation andmaintanance of these biases."
5372,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current diagnostic tests cannot reliably determine prostate cancer extent (volume and location) or biological aggressiveness. Our long term goal is to develop a non-invasive imaging technique that accurately assesses the clinical significance of prostate cancer and that can be used for diagnosis, treatment planning, and therapeutic monitoring. The main objective of this particular application is to realize the full potential of 3 Tesla MRI to generate cancer probability maps by combining the multi-parametric data generated from anatomic and functional studies within a new statistical model. Therefore, based on previous results from our group and others, the central hypothesis is that multi-parametric anatomic, vascular and metabolic data can determine the extent and aggressiveness of prostate cancer as validated by correlation with postoperative histopathologic determination of extent and tumor grade, and molecular assessment of aggressiveness. Supported by previous developments, this hypothesis will be tested with four specific aims: 1) generate parametric maps from MRI data acquired and processed with novel techniques; 2) develop and validate a 3-dimensional (3D) strategy to spatially co-register MRI images to histopathology sections from prostatectomy; 3) develop a classifier based on 3T MRI data to produce a 3D probability map of cancer; and 4) identify MRI features that predict histological and molecular markers of aggressiveness. Under the first two aims MRI data will be acquired and processed with developed methods to generate improved parametric maps which are then registered to reconstructed histopathology volumes. Under the third aim, the MRI parametric maps and histopathology results are used to train a statistical classifier to facilitate the generation of patient specific cancer probability maps. Finally, in the fourth aim, proven molecular markers of aggressiveness will be correlated with MRI, histopathology and standard clinical factors. The proposed work is innovative in several ways: 1) it will implement new acquisition and quantitation methods for DCE-MRI and 3DSI on a 3 Tesla system; 2) it will use novel and robust statistical modeling to simultaneously combine anatomic and MRI data to determine the extent of cancer, and 3) it will correlate MRI features with spatially registered histopathology and proven aggressiveness biomarkers. Our expected outcome is the development of a novel MRI-based imaging method to non-invasively and reliably determine both the extent and aggressiveness of prostate cancer. It is our hope that the methods developed in this study may permit doctors and their patients to make better treatment decisions and reduce morbidity and mortality due to prostate cancer."
5375,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to a cocaine-associated environment elicits craving and/or an increase in propensity for relapse in cocaine users. Persistent and reoccurring environmentally triggered motivation for cocaine is likely elicited by plasticity in associative learning, memory, motivation, and executive cognitive function, implicating the involvement of the hippocampal formation, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and frontal cortex in this phenomenon. However, the neural bases of context-induced drug relapse have been largely uncharacterized in part due to the scarcity of animal models that can be used to assess the motivational effects of environmental stimuli predictive of drug availability, as opposed to the motivational effects of conditioned stimuli paired explicitly with cocaine infusions. Using a new animal model in which cocaine seeking is elicited by exposure to a context predictive of drug availability, we have recently demonstrated that the functional integrity of the dorsal hippocampus (DH), basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and nucleus accumbens core (NACc) is necessary for contextual reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Taking a systems neurobiological approach, the proposed project expands the mapping of this critical pathway by further examining the role of the hippocampal formation, specifically the involvement of the ventral hippocampus (VH), subiculum, and entorhinal cortex, in contextual reinstatement of cocaine and food seeking using the tetrodotoxin-induced reversible neural inactivation method. Using similar techniques, the project will also further investigate the involvement of the NACc and nucleus accumbens shell in contextual reinstatement of cocaine and food seeking, as the former structure is postulated to be the input structure of the relapse circuitry toward the basal ganglia (Aim 1). Reversible asymmetrical inactivation (i.e., disconnection) will then be used to test the hypothesis that, within the contextual relapse circuitry, sequential information processing occurs between the DH and dmPFC as well as between the BLA and dmPFC via parallel loops, and information is then sequentially processed by the dmPFC and NACc (Aim 2). Lastly, the project will test the hypotheses that AMPA and metabotropic glutamate (mGLU) receptors within the relapse circuitry play a critical role in contextual reinstatement and that cocaine-induced adaptations in these receptor systems facilitate cocaine seeking. To this end, the project will examine dose-dependent effects of locally infused selective AMPA, group 1 mGLU, and group 2 mGLU receptor antagonists and/or agonists on contextual reinstatement of cocaine and food seeking (Aim 3). In summary, the objective of the proposed project is to elucidate the neurobiological and neuropharmacological mechanisms of contextual cocaine seeking. The resulting data have the potential to provide a rationale for the development of novel treatments for cue-induced drug relapse."
5385,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have identified several new TB vaccine candidate antigens based on human T cell responses and animal protection. Priority has been given to those that both elicit a Th1 response from PBMC from PPD positive healthy donors and protect in rodent models. Several animal models have been developed to evaluate vaccine efficacy and are currently being used to further characterize vaccine candidates and adjuvant/delivery systems. We propose to expand the evaluation of candidate vaccine antigens through extensive testing in clinically and geographically diverse populations, using state of the art immunological assays. This section will provide important information on conservation of antigens in genetically diverse populations infected with diverse isolates. These studies will also lay the foundation for definition of key immunological correlates of protection. In parallel, we will perform immunogenicity studies using priority antigens and vaccine formulations in rodent models. We will also perform detailed analysis of the immune responses of human volunteers immunized with Mtb72f in AS02A, the first defined TB vaccine to enter clinical trials. Finally, we will test antigens/vaccine formulations in rodent models of infection and disease. By the end of the funding period, we will have defined a second vaccine candidate for entry into clinical trials."
5420,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of several important human diseases including cancer. Inhibition of angiogenesis is a promising strategy to control tumor growth and metastasis. The main objective of this application is to discover and develop new angiogenesis inhibitors from existing clinical drugs and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis inhibition by two angiogenesis inhibitors previously discovered to facilitate the development of the next generation of angiogenesis inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. In preliminary studies, we have assembled a library of mostly FDA-approved clinical drugs and screened it in an endothelial cell proliferation assay. We have identified several potent hits including an immunosuppressant drug and an antifungal drug. We have further demonstrated the efficacy of both drugs in blocking VEGF- and bFGF- mediated angiogenesis in vivo. In this study, we propose to further expand the clinical drug library to include more FDA-approved drugs as well as those that have reached phase II clinical trials to identify additional inhibitors of angiogenesis and make the library available to the wider scientific community to screen in other cellular models. We will further characterize the function of the immunosuppressant target in both T cell activation and angiogenesis in mice and humans. We will attempt to identify new inhibitors for the immunosuppressant target to reduce the toxicity of the existing drug by a combination of combinatorial click chemistry and high-throughput screening. We will perform experiments to verify a potential target for the antifungal drug in endothelial cells and perform SAR studies on the antifungal drug in attempts to prepare affinity reagents to identify and validate its target in endothelial cells and to improve the efficacy of the drug for inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, plays an essential role in several important human diseases including cancer. The main objective of this application is to discover and develop new angiogenesis inhibitors from existing drugs to accelerate the translation of basic research findings into new cancer treatments and to facilitate the development of future generations of anti-angiogenic drugs with improved specificity and lower toxicity."
5433,HHS,NSF,"This competitive renewal is a series of 4 studies using the naloxone (NX) novel-response discriminationprocedure in opioid-dependent humans that build upon our demonstration that this procedure can be usedsuccessfully as a model of opiate withdrawal (OW) to examine nonopioid mechanisms underlying thisphenomenon. Previously, we showed that the opioid agonist hydromorphone blocks the effects of NX whilethe partial opioid agonists nalbuphine and butorphanol, and the alpha2-adrenergic (A2A) antagonistyohimbine produced NX-like effects. The relative efficacy of nonopioid compounds to attenuate the effects ofNX were: Ca++ channel blocker (CCB) isradipine > A2A agonist clonidine => partial glycine agonist D-cycloserine >¿ NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan. This project will use the NX novel responsediscrimination procedure in opioid-dependent humans in order to do the following: 1) explore the efficacy ofCCBs by testing the proto-typic L-type agents (nifedipine, diltiazem, verapamil) as well as the N-type CCBgabapentin; 2) explore the efficacy of D-cycloserine at higher doses and examine the efficacy of the A2Aagonist lofexidine; and 3) examine the efficacy of test compound combinations (e.g., lofexidine andisradipine) to attenuate the behavioral effects of NX. In the instructed novel response NX discriminationprocedure, opioid-maintained subjects are trained to distinguish between NX (0.15 mg/70 kg) and placebo.Then effects of various agents are examined alone and combined with NX to determine whether theyproduce effects similar to either training condition or neither condition and alter NX's effects. This procedureallows for simultaneously assessing objective behavioral measures such as discrimination, self-reports andphysiological responses, providing a wide behavioral profile of the OW phenomenon. The novel responseprocedure helps clarify interpretations of partial generalization and antagonism. This paradigm provides asensitive, standard, objective, systematic method to identify potential agents for enhancing OW treatmentwhich can be examined further in a detox protocol."
5484,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The long term objective of this research is to develop tissue engineering therapies for cartilage repair by understanding better the mechanisms of tissue repair and designing practical strategies that can be clinically applied. Tissue engineering is a multidisciplinary field that aims to regenerate and replace tissues lost due to disease, congenital abnormalities, or traumatic events. Orthopedic and plastic surgery are areas of medicine where tissue engineering has a potential to significantly improve surgical options by providing a source of tissue for repair and/or augmentation. Our strategy for repair involves a cell-laden hydrogel that can be injected in a defect and polymerized (solidified) in a minimally invasive manner using light. Mesenchymal stem cells photoencapsulated in a biomaterial scaffold will provide the basis for tissue repair.    This proposal is both hypothesis and design driven. We hypothesize that degrading hydrogels will enhance tissue matrix production and will therefore investigate the synthesis of novel hydrogels with degradable phosphoester units. We also hypothesize that creating multilayered hydrogel structures will allow us to coculture cells in a 3D environment to 1.) engineer the zonal organization of cartilage, 2.) engineer osteochondral tissues, and 3.) investigate the influence of cell interactions (coculture) on tissue development. The design driven portion of the proposal will develop a clinically practical strategy for cartilage repair. The repair strategy will address 1.) biomaterial integration to the surrounding tissue and 2.) engineering new cartilage repair in an injectable hydrogel. The integration strategy will comprise a primer based on the biopolymer, chondroitin sulfate, modified with chemistries to provide a covalent bridge between cartilage and the injected hydrogel biomaterial. The envisioned tissue repair materials can be injected into a defect and photopolymerized in a minimally invasive fashion. To test these hypotheses and design the repair system the following specific aims will be investigated:  Specific aim 1. Development of a novel biodegradable phosphoester-PEG photopolymerizing polymer for engineering cartilage and bone using adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.  Specific aim 2. Engineering of multilayered hydrogels for development of zonally organized cartilage and osteochondral tissues.  Specific aim 3. Chemical attachment of hydrogels to cartilage for improved tissue-implant integration in the joint."

This application focuseson the 24p3/24p3R transcriptionally-regulated proapoptotic pathway that our laboratory discovered and hasbeen studying for the past several years. We originally identified 24p3 as the gene undergoing maximumtranscriptional stimulation following induction of apoptosis by cytokine-deprivation of interleukin 3 (IL-3)dependent cells. 24p3 is a secreted lipocalin, which we have found induces apoptosis when added to avariety of lymphoid cells. These and other results revealed a model in which IL-3deprivation activates 24p3transcription, leading to synthesis and secretion of 24p3, which induces apoptosis through anautocrine/paracrine pathway. We have isolated the 24p3 cell surface receptor (24p3R) and found that 24p3induces apoptosis through a novel pathway culminating in a decrease in intracellular iron levels. Thedecrease in intracellular iron induces expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim, resulting in apoptosis.Intracellular iron delivery blocks induction of Bim and suppresses apoptosis due to 24p3 addition or IL-3deprivation. In this application we propose experiments to study the role of the 24p3/24p3R proapoptoticpathway in normal physiology and myeloproliferative disease using cell lines, patient samples and animalmodels. The basis by which decreased intracellular iron induces apoptosis is not well understood. We willcontinue to characterize the apoptotic pathway induced by 24p3 and by iron chelators. Expression profilingand RNA interference will be used to identify transcriptionally activated genes involved in 24p3- and ironchelator-mediated apoptosis. Our preliminary results suggest a possible role for the 24p3/24p3R pathway inglucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis and glucocorticoid-resistance, which we will continue to investigate. Wehave found that the BCR-ABL oncoprotein counteracts the 24p3/24p3R proapoptotic pathway bymisregulating expression of 24p3 and 24p3R. These results reveal a new and unanticipated aspect of themechanism by which BCR-ABL promotes cell survival. We will continue to analyze the generality of thisresult and study the basis by which 24p3 and 24p3R transcription is misregulated. We have derived 24p3homozygous knockout mice, which will be used to study the contribution of the 24p3/24p3R proapoptoticpathway to BCR/ABL-induced myeloproliferative disease."
5505,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Aging is a risk factor for development of coronary and peripheral artery diseases. The extent of ischemic damage and functional recovery in case of extensive impairment of vascularization is largely depending on the development of new collateral vessels. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), a macrophage/monocyte-derived pluripotent mediator and pro-inflammatory cytokine is expressed in ischemic areas and reported to induce angiogenesis. TNF has been reported to induce the expression of many angiogenesis related genes, through two different TNF receptors, TNFR1 (p55) and TNFR2 (p75). In various vascular ECs, TNF increased the expression of angiogenic factors VEGF, bFGF, IL-8, however, the role of two distinct TNF receptors in mediating these responses are still unclear. Hypothesis: p55 is largely known to mediate cytotoxic effects of TNF, whereas signaling through p75 is mostly implied in protective effects of TNF-alpha and because aging is associated with increased expression of p55 and decreased expression of p75 in cells from aged humans we hypothesized that the p75 may be essential in angiogenic signaling in adults. Purpose: 1) Determine the contribution of TNFR2 p75 on VEGF and bFGF gene expression on EC function in vitro and on angiogenesis in vivo; TNF-induced pro-angiogenic signaling and EC function is mediated, in large part, through p75 TNFR2. 2) Determine molecular mechanisms underlying TNF-mediated ischemia-induced survival and apoptosis signaling in ECs; In the absence of TNFR2 p75 post-ischemic apoptotic signaling is exaggerated. 3) Determine to what extent ischemia-induced mobilization, migration and recruitment of EPCs from bone marrow depends on signaling through p75 TNFR2; a) Ischemia-induced mobilization of EPCs from bone marrow is mediated, at least in part, via TNFR2 p75; b) Functional TNFR2 p75 is necessary for proper contribution of bone marrow-derived EPCs to post-ischemic recovery. Significance: the goal of this proposal is to define certain molecular mechanisms of iscmemia-induced TNF- mediated angiogenic signaling that may be impaired in adult tissue, in part, due to age-associated decrease in TNFR2 p75 expression. In addition, this proposal may lead to an identification of a gene target, which can be used to improve the poor recovery and prevent the development of severe ischemia-induced damage in adult coronary and peripheral vascular diseases."
5515,HHS,HHS,"The interleukin 4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4Ra) plays a key role in allergic inflammatoryresponses. However, whereas the function of its dedicated transcription factor Stat6 inpromoting allergic inflammation is well established, those of the other two signalingbranches down-stream of the IL-4Ra I4R and ITIM motifs remains unclear. Byemploying a targeted gene knock-in approach that inactivated the I4R motif bymutagenesis of its effector tyrosine residue into phenylalanine (Y500F), we havedemonstrated novel tissue and ligand-specific functions of this motif. The Y500Fmutation enhanced antigen-driven antibody responses and allergic airway inflammation,consistent with a negative regulatory function of the I4R motif in receptor signaling.Remarkably however, I4R mutagenesis selectively impaired two cardinal effects of DL-13on resident airway tissues, including induction of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR)and metaplasia of primary tracheal epithelial cell cultures into goblet cells, while sparingthe induction of the same events by IL-4. To examine the mechanism of enhancedantibody response in Y500F mutants, we propose to test the hypothesis that the I4R motifdown-regulates DL-4Ra signaling in B cells and identify the molecular basis of thisfunction. To probe the function of the I4R motif in IL-13 signaling in resident airwaytissues, we propose to examine the hypothesis that signaling via the I4R motif mediateskey EL-13 responses in airway epithelial cells relevant to AHR and goblet cell metaplasia,and that it mediates aspects of IL-13-dependent chronic structural airway changes.Finally, we propose to employ newly derived mice in which the ITIM motif has beeninactivated by mutagenesis of its effector tyrosine residue (Y709F) to address the in vivofunction of this motif in IL-4Ra signaling and allergic inflammation. These studies willidentify fundamental regulatory mechanisms involved in allergic inflammation and helpdevise targeted interventions in related medical conditions including asthma."
5537,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study will examine processing speed in children with cerebral palsy by utilizing inspection time (IT) to measure speed of visualization, a component of PS. PS is associated with development of critical cognitive functions including working memory and fluid intelligence, and is sensitive to brain dysfunction, medication effects, and aging. Traditional PS measures such as Wechsler Coding and Digit Symbol tests have significant motor demands and are not accessible to many children with CP. IT tasks, which measure a component of PS, can be administered using modified response strategies. IT tasks consist of visual stimuli presented on a computer screen for varied, but controlled lengths of time, e.g. 50ms. Examinees are asked to make a simple decision regarding the stimuli's visual properties, with IT measured as the shortest presentation time for which an individual judges correctly 70% of the time. Because IT tasks are commonly offered via computer, they are amenable to assistive technology. Because response time is not a necessary component of IT tasks, the task is, by its nature, more accessible to individuals with impairments of communication and movement than standard graphomotor PS tasks. Targeted medical, psycho-educational, and vocational interventions and planning for this population depend in part upon accurate assessment of cognitive ability. Accessible assessment of a component of PS in children with severe impairments of communication and movement would allow sensitive measurement of cognitive capabilities and changes in function in this population. Specific aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1: To examine psychometric properties, including reliability and validity, of a modified IT task. Hypothesis 1.1: The modified IT procedure will have adequate test-retest reliability with stability coefficients at or above .80. Hypothesis 1.2: The modified IT procedure will show adequate concurrent validity. Hypothesis 1.3: The modified IT procedure will show adequate criterion validity. Specific Aim 2: To compare the IT profiles within and between groups using the traditional and modified IT task procedures. Hypothesis 2.1: Between-group differences in IT profiles will be maintained across instrument type. Hypothesis 2.1: IT performance in children with CP will be independent of level of motor impairment. To accomplish these aims, 60 children with CP and 60 typically developing (TD) children will participate in the study. The 60 children diagnosed with CP will be comprised of two subgroups, each representing different levels of impairment. The first group consists of children who communicate verbally (VCP) and have functional activity levels classified as GMFCS I-III. The second group will consist of children who communicate nonverbally (NVCP) and classified as GMFCS Levels IV and V. TD peers will be matched for age and gender. Multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) will be used to describe differences in neuropsychological profiles between CP and TD groups, and between CP subgroups. It is expected that the psychometric foundation laid by the current proposal would set the stage for larger studies that examine neuropsychological outcomes, including neuroanatomic and neurophysiological correlates of IT in children with CP, more accurate assessment of cognitive potential, and medication effects in children with different subtypes of CP and different perinatal and socioenvironmental risk factors."
5578,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is increasing evidence that both mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage contributes to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis. In our previous grant period, we found an increase in cytochrome oxidase mtDNA mutations in both aging and AD, and an increase in mtDNA mutations in the control region of mtDNA. There may be a direct interaction of amyloid-p peptide (A¿) with Cu2+ to induce cytochrome oxidase dysfunction, and with the A¿ alcohol dehydrogenase within mitochondria to increase free radical generation. We propose to isolate mitochondria from both a double APR mutant and a triple transgenic mouse model of AD, to measure mitochondrial A¿ levels and to correlate levels with mitochondrial bioenergetics, free radical production, calcium uptake capacity and ability to activate the mitochondrial permeability transition. We will also determine APR cleavage and A¿ production in cultured neurons under conditions of increased or decreased mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. A partial deficiency of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), increases oxidative damage and exacerbates A¿ deposition in a transgenic mouse model of AD. We propose to cross a transgenic mouse model of AD with mice overexpressing MnSOD to determine whether this will ameliorate oxidative damage, A|3 deposition and spatial memory deficits. Lastly, we found that both coenzyme Q10 and genetic deficiency of NOS2 reduce A¿ deposition and improve survival of a transgenic mouse model of AD. We, therefore, propose to determine whether optimal administration of coenzyme Q10 and of a selective NOS 2 inhibitor can improve oxidative damage, A¿ deposition and spatial memory deficits in transgenic mouse models of AD. These studies will further define the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in AD pathogenesis and have the potential of leading to important new therapies."
5581,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycystin-2 is a non-selective calcium channel that regulates tubulogenesis and maintains homeostasis in several organ systems, including the liver, heart, and kidneys. Mutations in polycystin-2 account for 15% of the cases of people with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a genetically inherited disorder causing renal failure. Most polycystin-2 in epithelial cells localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it combines with the IPS receptor to control calcium homeostasis. Yet little is known about the mechanisms that localize this polytopic membrane channel to the ER. Our laboratory identified PACS-2 as a novel sorting protein and recently discovered that it binds to the cytosolic domain of polycystin-2 and is required to localize the channel to the ER. PACS-2 connects polycystin-2 to COPI, a vesicular coat protein that controls Golgi-to-ER retrieval. PACS-2/COPI may control the ER localization of polycystin-2 by directing an efficient Golgi-to-ER trafficking step. To test this hypothesis, experiments in Aim 1 will determine whether ER localization of polycystin-2 requires COPI and whether PKD2 is localized to the ER through a retentionor retrieval-based mechanism. To test the role of COPI in controlling the ER localization of full-length polycystin-2, we will use siRNA depletion of the beta-COP subunit and develop two polycystin-2 reporter constructs will be developed to determine quantitatively whether polycystin-2 is localized to the ER by a Golgi-to-ER retrieval step and the role of PACS-2 and COPI in directing this pathway. Specific aim 2 will determine which of the seven COPI subunits and residues in the polycystin-2 cytosolic domain-in addition to phosphorylated Ser812-are important for binding to PACS-2 and directing ER localization of polycystin-2. Yeast two-hybrid genetic screens and protein binding assays will identify COPI subunits and amino acid residues within the polycystin-2 cytosolic domain essential for complex formation. Polycystin-2 reporter molecules containing mutations of identified amino acids will be expressed to rigorously determine their role in the ER localization of polycystin-2 and their potential role in the targeting of polycystin-2 to the TGN, cell surface and primary cilia. Together, these studies will identify the fundamental mechanisms that control the subcellular localization of polycystin-2 and may provide a foundation to understand how intracellular signaling pathways are disrupted in polycystic kidney disease. The proposed studies are relevant to public health because insight into how polycystin-2 action is regulated is crucial for understanding kidney function and for developing therapies that can protect ADPKD patients from the devastating effect of this disease."

Croatia has higher injury mortality rates than most European countries, and has unique risk factors related to war and landmine injuries. Our aims are to: 1) train scientists to conduct injury prevention research, 2) develop and strengthen the Stampar School of Public Health as a center of excellence in injury control research, 3) facilitate the transition of trainees to positions of responsibility and influence in the region, and 4) develop infrastructure to translate injury research into public health practise. This effort builds on three areas of strength: 1) Ul has maintained an active Fogerty training program in Occupational Health in Eastern Europe since 1995; 2) Ul has a leading CDC-funded Injury Prevention and Control Research Center, established in 1990, and 3) advances in the use of cutting edge teaching technology, such as real-time audio and visual with the use of Polycom, will be used to maximize communication and use resources efficiently. Training will be focused on mid-career professionals who will have opportunities for long-term, short-term, and degree-focused training.  Long-term trainees will begin the program with 6 months of distance education and communication with an established mentor, followed by five months of training in the US. Training in the US will include a curriculum of injury prevention courses, ethical conduct of research, and tailored electives. While in the US, trainees will work with a mentor to get research experience and develop a research plan and proposal. Upon returning to the country, trainees will undertake a planned research activity and conduct a distance-learning symposium to share their findings. Trainees will also be eligible for return US short-term training and degree programs."
5605,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of bacterial keratitis. Pneumococcal keratitis causes damage that can result in irreversible corneal scarring. The corneal damage seen in pneumococcal keratitis has been attributed mainly to bacterial virulence factors that stimulate an intense host response. Important to pneumococcal keratitis is the production of pneumolysin, a virulence factor capable of cell lysis as well as the activation of complement. In non-ocular infections, the production of pneumolysin is not sufficient to achieve virulence; the organism must also produce a polysaccharide capsule. The role of the capsule in keratitis or other ocular infections has not been established and preliminary data from this laboratory suggests that the capsule may not contribute to ocular virulence. This point is significant because vaccination of patients has been suggested as a means to prevent pneumococcal ocular infections. The research proposed is designed to develop means to limit the damage associated with pneumococcal keratitis. This research consists of using new therapies directed toward the virulence factors responsible for protecting the organism and stimulating the damaging inflammatory response. The immediate aims are to: 1) determine if the capsule is a virulence factor in keratitis, a study that could show that the cornea, unlike vascularized body sites, is susceptible to infection by unencapsulated strains; 2) determine if the inhibition of pneumolysin by topical application of a molecule that inhibits its binding to cells will provide protection against inflammation to the infected cornea, a possibility that is supported by preliminary studies; and 3) determine if antibody to pneumolysin can be used actively or passively to limit or prevent the ability of this molecule to induce inflammation with tissue damaging effects. From a public health perspective, bacteria including pneumococcus are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. The development of alternative and novel therapies for bacterial eye infections will help to prevent scarring and loss of the eye."
5608,HHS,NSF,"Many disorders of urinary bladder sensation, which is common in interstitial cystitis, bladder outletobstruction, and bladder over activity, including idiopathic detrussor instability, are characterized by pain anddiscomfort and enhanced sensitivity to stimuli (i.e., bladder hypersensitivity). Inflammation is present inmany, but not all major bladder disorders and interstitial cystitis, for example, often presents withoutdemonstrable organic cause (i.e., there is no apparent mechanical, biochemical or inflammatory condition toexplain the symptoms). Visceral hypersensitivity thus can differ from somatic hyperalgesia, which is typicallyassociated with tissue injury and inflammation. Because the anatomical organization of innervation andadequate noxious stimuli for the viscera are unlike the innervation and adequate noxious stimuli in thesomatic realm, peripheral mechanisms of visceral hypersensitivity differ from those of somatic hyperalgesiaand are not well understood. The long term objective of this research program is to understand peripheralmechanisms of bladder hypersensitivity. The current application proposes to establish functional relevance of stimuli and treatments beforesubsequent examination of peripheral contributions to the development of bladder hypersensitivity. Theperipheral receptors to be examined for contributions to bladder hypersensitivity include ASIC3, TRPV1,P2X2-3 and PAR2, all of which have been implicated in visceral hypersensitivity. For each of these receptors,in normal and hypersensitive conditions (e.g., cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis), we will study: 1) theircontribution to bladder voiding and reflex micturition to functionally evaluate bladder hypersensitivity, 2)mechano- and chemo-sensitivity of pelvic nerve and lumbar splanchnic nerve fiber terminals in the bladderusing an in vitro bladder-nerve preparation, and 3) whole cell currents and excitability of bladder sensoryneurons, identified by content of retrograde tracer. The overall hypothesis is that these four ligand-gated ionchannels contribute to mechano-transduction in the urinary bladder. We also hypothesize that protonsand/or endogenous mediators (e.g., ATP,mast cell tryptase) contribute to bladder hypersensitivity and cando so even in the absence of frank tissue damage, which is relevant to interstitial cystitis and other so-called functional  visceral disorders."
5620,HHS,NSF,"The goal of this proposal is to participate as a clinical site in exploratory trials of neuroprotective agentsfor patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is a slowly progressive neurological disorder, whichresults in severe disability. Current therapies do not alter the course of the disease. However, a number ofnew compounds have been identified that have the potential to slow down or even halt the progression ofPD. If any of these compounds can truly protect viable neurons from degenerating, they would delay or evenprevent significant disability in the millions of patients who suffer from PD. Our primary objective with thisproject will be to recruit and retain research subjects in the neuroprotection pilot studies and subsequentphase III trials. The University of Florida will act as one site with 3 equal branches on 3 UF-affiliatedMovement Disorder Clinical Trial Centers: Shands @ Gainesville, Malcom Randall VA Medical Center, andShands @ Jacksonville. All three sites will be acting as consortia sites under the banner of the University ofFlorida, modelled after some of the current consortia Centers that successfully recruited as a group in thefirst 2 pilot NET-PD trials. With 3 high-quality Movement Disorders Centers located in 2 ethnically-diversemetropolitan areas serving almost the entire veteran and non-veteran population of North-Central and North-Eastern Florida, we anticipate easy recruitment of at least 2 PD patients per month (24 total/year) for boththe pilot studies and the large simple phase III trial. Each Center and its investigators carry an impressivehistory of successful participation, enrollment and collaboration in PD multi-center trials. All 3 recruiting andenrolling investigators at the 3 UF Centers are fellowship-trained in Movement Disorders.

5655,HHS,HHS,"How the brain regulates states of consciousness is not known, but first-order circuits detailing interactionsbetween wake-active and sleep-active neurons have been proposed. Here we focus on a portion of thewake circuit that involves the basal forebrain (BF) and link it to the neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT). Thebasal forebrain (BF)has been implicated in regulating wakefulness (Szymusiak, 2000), and containsneurons that are preferentially wake/REM-active or sleep-active (Szymusiak, 2000). The sleep-activeneurons are GABAergic (Manns et al.,-2003) and could oppose the wake-active neurons (Jones, 2004). Thewake-active neurons are thought to be driven by ascending influences from other arousal populations(Semba, 2000), and are hypothesized to shut-off by the localized build-up of adenosine (AD) (Porkka-Heiskanen et al., 1997). Although in the BF adenosine levels rise with wakefulness and then fall with sleep,would adenosine levels rise with prolonged waking if the cholinergic neurons were absent? This is animportant question that surprisingly has never been investigated, but which can easily be answered by using192-lgG-saporin to lesion the BF cholinergic neurons and measuring adenosine in the BF that is devoid ofcholinergic neurons. Here we propose four aims utilizing overlapping methodologies and transgenic rats totest a specific circuit. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that in the absence of the BF cholinergic neuronsadenosine will not build in the BF in response to waking. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that in the absence ofthe BF cholinergic neurons adenosine or the adenosine A1 receptor agonist CHA will not induce sleep. Aim3 will link the HCRT system with the BF cholinergic system by demonstrating that ascending influences fromthis prominent arousal system drives the BF. We will directly test this possibility by demonstrating that in192-lgG sap lesioned rats HCRT will be less effective in evoking wakefulness. In aim 4 we will utilize theataxin-HCRT transgenic rats to test this circuit. We will measure AD levels in the BF of the transgenic ratsand hypothesize that in response to prolonged waking they will be lower compared to wild-type control rats,since the HCRT neurons are lost and not driving the BF neurons. Then 192-lgG saporin will be used in thetransgenic rats to lesion the BF cholinergic neurons and we hypothesize that with both the BF cholinergicand HCRT neurons lost, the rats should have more sleep compared to single lesions."
5660,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in the treatment of seizure disorders, medically intractable epilepsy requiring surgical treatment remains a serious problem. The concept of treating seizures by grafting inhibitory interneurons into seizure foci is more than a decade old, but has yet to lead to clinically useful approaches. However, recent studies on the origins and specification of cortical interneurons warrant a new examination of this issue. We propose to use intracerebral grafts of interneuron precursors to treat chronic seizures that are focally induced in the adult mouse cortex. This study combines the expertise of two laboratories at Weill-Cornell Medical College. The PI, an Assistant Professor of Neurological Surgery, studies the propagation of cortical seizures in rodent models of epilepsy using in vivo electrophysiology and intrinsic optical imaging. The co-investigator, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, studies the specification of cortical interneuron subtypes in mice using transplantation of interneuron progenitors from the subcortical embryonic forebrain into the postnatal cortex.     In Aim 1 the investigators will optimize the protocol for transplantation of interneuron progenitors into Tetanus Toxin (TTx)-induced chronic epileptic foci. In addition, effects of chronic seizures on interneuron migration, survival, and differentiation will be examined. Preliminary data suggest that, like transplants interneuron progenitors into the cortex of normal adult mice, transplants into TTx-induced seizure foci also result in migration, survival, and interneuronal differentiation of substantial numbers cells.     Aim 2 will test the system-level functionality of transplanted interneurons by determining their ability to suppress epileptiform activity in the TTx model. Epileptiform activity will be assessed by simultaneous telemetry and video monitoring for several weeks before and several months following transplantation. The capacity to reduce epileptiform discharges with transplants of interneuron progenitor pools that are enriched for distinct interneuron subgroups will be compared to vehicle and cell-based controls. The results will strengthen the rationale for future studies using interneuron-progenitor directed stem cells, and also to explore the use of interneuron progenitors as a cell-based delivery system of anti-epileptic agents.     The advances resulting from this proposal should inform efforts to prevent or interrupt intractable epileptogenesis resulting from focal lesions. The application of this research to increasingly clinically-oriented studies will be achieved by consultation with Dr. Theodore Schwartz, a practicing neurosurgeon who is the Director of Research at the Center for Epilepsy Surgery at WMC."

Mass spectrometric instrumentation, method, andcomputer software will be developed to facilitate proteomics and to expedite the determination of thestructure and properties of peptides and proteins. An important goal is the muscle proteome.Resident at Washington University is the necessary personnel and equipment infrastructure todetermine this proteome and make unique contributions to understanding metabolic andneuromuscular diseases. The means to achieving this specific aim are to implement computer andchemical means to enhance information content of mass spectrometric methods in proteomics, toidevelop hydrogen/deuterium amide exchange to probe protein structure and interactions, and todevelop Fourier transform mass spectrometric instrumentation for iimproving mass resolving powerand mass-measurement accuracy for peptides and proteins. The second analyte focus is complexlipids, an area of long-standing and productive interest at Washington University. Structuredetermination of this class of analytes will be pursued by developing new methods and comparingcutting-edge instruments for analysis of lipids in complex mixtures. To facilitate interpretation ofstructural information, a major experimental and theoretical effort will be continued to understand themechanisms of lipid fragmentation in mass spectrometry. Better means of determining lipidstructure will have major impact in understanding diabetes mellitus, atherosclerotic cardiovasculardisease, and lipotoxicity. The third analyte is nucleic acids, and the goal is to use massspectrometry to determine the structures of normal and damaged oligonucleotides and themechanisms of the fragmentations that underpin structure determination.

5679,HHS,HHS,"The urinary bladder has two major functions; storage and voiding of urine. Contraction and relaxation of the urinarybladder smooth muscle (UBSM) is crucial to these tasks. Sympathetic nerves maintain relaxation of the bladder duringfilling via stimulation of (3-adrenoceptors. However, the exact physiological mechanisms by which P-adrenergicstimulation relaxes UBSM is unknown. Urinary incontinence is a common urogenital disease that can lead to life-threatening kidney problems. The mostwidespread type of incontinence, urge incontinence, is a result of increased UBSM contractions. Evidence suggests thatdefects in UBSM receptors or ion channels, such as the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channel and the smallconductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channel may underlie certain forms of urinary bladder dysfunction, including urgeincontinence. We recently demonstrated that BK channel can be activated upon P-adrenergic stimulation to promoteUBSM relaxation via a Ca2+-dependent mechanism (Petkov & Nelson, 2005, American Journal of Physiology). This project will focus on elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which P-adrenergic stimulationpromotes UBSM relaxation. The overall hypothesis is that P-adrenergic stimulation relaxes UBSM viamechanisms, involving BK and SK channels, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ and urothelium. Specific aim 1 will elucidate the mechanisms by which P-adrenergic stimulation activates BK channels; Specific aim 2 will elucidate the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ in P-adrenergic UBSM relaxation; Specific aim 3 will elucidate the roles of SK channels and the urothelium in P-adrenergic relaxation of UBSM. We will use an integrated approach, combining electrophysiological, Ca2+ imaging, molecular biology, as well as invivo and in vitro functional studies on bladder contractility in normal and genetically engineered mice to address thefundamental issue of P-adrenergic regulation of UBSM function. Establishing the exact molecular mechanisms of UBSM P-adrenergic relaxation will provide new potentialtherapeutic targets for treating urinary incontinence."
5686,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  NAD metabolism is rapidly altered following genotoxic stress by the activation of ADP-ribose (ADPR) polymer cycles. These cycles are mediated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases 1 and 2 (PARP-1, PARP-2) and poly ADP-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG) and they play a major role in the maintenance of genomic integrity by mediating cell recovery or cell death following genotoxic stress. PARG functions in the nucleus where ADPR polymers are synthesized but we have discovered a mitochonddal isoform of PARG. The hypothesis to be tested is that nuclear and mitochondrial PARG are key components of a signaling and sensing mechanism reporting the amount of DNA damage and integrating this information with key mitochondrial regulators of cell death. The presence of PARG in mitochondria is intriguing as PARP-1 initiated ADPR polymer cycles are linked to release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria following genotoxic stress but PARP-1 itself is not present in mitochondria. Our hypothesis predicts that nuclear PARG promotes cell recovery and prevents cell death by preventing formation of free ADPR polymers at low levels of genotoxic stress but generates free ADPR polymers that can be released from the nucleus following high levels of genotoxic stress to participate in AIF release from mitochondria. The mitochondrial PARG isoform prevents inappropriate AIF release by ADPR polymers and must be saturated with ADPR polymers before AIF can be released from mitochondda. The specific aims by which this hypothesis will be tested include defining the role of nuclear and mitochonddal PARG isoforms in DNA damage response signaling leading to cell recovery and cell death (Aim 1), defining the regulation of PARG gene expression and the relationship between the expression of the PARG gene and the mitochondrial import protein gene TIM23 with which it shares a common promoter (Aim 2), and defining key structural features of the PARG protein (Aim 3). We will modulate PARG content and activity using PARG gene disrupted mouse cells, novel cell permeable PARG inhibitors, and by overexpression PARG isoforms and site-directed mutants. The innovation of the application is that is represents a new paradigm for cross talk between nucleus and mitochondria for regulation of cell death and that powerful genetic and chemical tools have been developed to test the central hypothesis. The proposed research also provides the opportunity to evaluate PARG as a therapeutic target."

The overall objective of the Program Project Grant remains the same as the original, namely, to elucidate the molecular basis of the actions of drugs of abuse, particularly psychostimulants, in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens. The addictive properties of drugs of abuse such as psychostimulants depend on their ability to augment dopamine neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.     The Program Project Grant is organized in four Projects, a Scientific Core and an Administrative Core. The Administrative Core staff will support the integration of the researchers and institutions involved in the Program Project Grant. The main goal of the Scientific Core is to provide a research and technical support facility for all of the Program projects. Responsibilities of the Scientific Core will include the creation, characterization, and breeding of genetically altered animals; the design and execution of yeast two-hybrid studies; the production and maintenance of key reagents stocks and new reagents; and the performance of certain routine tasks required to accomplish the studies. Project I,  Psychostimulants and Dendritic spines,  will focus on the role five regulators of actin dynamics play as targets of psychostimulants in the dendritic spines. Project II,  The Role of DARPP-32, CK1, and CK2 in Mediating the Molecular and Behavioral Effects of Drugs of Abuse,  will extend previous studies of four key phosphorylation sites of DARPP-32 upon in vivo administration of drugs of abuse and chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. Project III,  Striatal Phosphoproteins and the Actions of Psychostimulants,  which will be a subcontract carried out at Yale University School of Medicine, study the role(s) of RCS and ARPP-16 in mediating or modulating the actions of psychostimulants as well as study the roles of the three isoforms of PP1 (PP1alpha, beta and gamma) in the actions of psychostimulants."
5712,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) and the CB1 cannabinoid receptor form a signaling system that plays a key role in several forms of short and long term neuronal plasticity. In addition, CB1 receptors are the primary target of cannabis, the most commonly used illicit drug in the US. Despite an increasing awareness of the importance of the cannabinoid signaling system in normal and pathological CNS function, the potential therapies targeting this system, and the social impact of cannabis use, our knowledge of how CB1 receptors and endocannabinoid production is regulated is quite modest. Understanding the control of the endocannabinoid system is vital to the rational assessment of therapies affecting this system, as well as to appreciating the impact of chronic activation of this system (as might happen therapeutically or by excessive cannabis use). In the proposed work we will address three specific aims: Is desensitization of cannabinoid inhibition of neurotransmission due to phosphorylation of the CB1 receptor at residues $426 and $430? Does regulated association of CB1 cannabinoid and D2 dopamine receptors underlie some of the interactions between dopamine and cannabinoid signaling? Which endocannabinoids are secreted by cultured neurons and from where are they released? By accomplishing these specific aims we will have a firm understanding of the molecular events associated with desensitization of CB1 receptor signaling, insight into the interactions between the cannabinoid and dopamine signaling pathways, knowledge of the endocannabinoids released by neurons and the domains of the neuron important in endocannabinoid release."
5718,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposal is to explore the hypothesis that the Notch pathway plays an important role in the development of diabetic nephropathy. We found via large scale genome screening that Notch pathway proteins are regulated in animal models of diabetic nephropathy. In vitro studies showed that the hyperglycemic milieu activates the Notch pathway and this activation leads to the dysfunction of glomerular cells. These observations suggest that the Notch pathway plays an important role in mediating diabetic complications. The specific aims of the proposal are to: Aim one is to characterize the molecular mechanism of glucose induced Notch pathway activation in podocytes. In the second specific aims we will determine the role of Notch pathway activation in glucose induced podocyte dysfunction. We will achieve this aim via genetic manipulation of Notch signaling. Under the third specific aim we will determine the in vivo functional role of glomerular epithelial Notch in mediating the development of diabetic nephropathy via the use of genetically engineered animals. In the long-term, this work will elucidate molecular signaling mechanisms determining specific, context dependent cellular responses, such as apoptosis and growth arrest that may be triggered by hyperglycemia in different cell types."
5742,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formation of the pituitary gland relies on the expression of extrinsic factors produced by the surrounding tissue and transcription factors intrinsic to the pituitary. These factors dictate the specification and proliferation of the 5 hormone producing cell types of the anterior pituitary gland. Developmental failure of the pituitary gland has serious consequences for human health. Most significantly, the disease multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD), results in absence of growth hormone producing cells, with at least one other hormone being affected. The clinical manifestations of MPHD include growth insufficiency and delayed sexual maturation. Although most cases of MPHD are due to unknown causes, loss of function of the Prop1df gene is the most commonly identified cause of MPHD. Propl is a paired like homeodomain transcription factor expressed exclusively in the developing pituitary. A mutation in this gene also leads to a loss of three pituitary cell types, somatotropes, thyrotropes, and lactotropes, in the Ames dwarf mouse (Prop1 df). We demonstrated that the cell loss in Prop1 mutant mice correlates with alterations in pattern or level of Notch gene expression. Notch2 protein is absent in these mutants, indicating that Notch2 is an effecter of Prop1 and may be involved in the emergence of terminally differentiated cell types during pituitary development. The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that controls cellular proliferation and differentiation in a broad spectrum of developmental systems. In humans, null mutations in Notch receptors would likely lead to prenatal lethality. However, mutations in Notch family members that subtly reduce or enhance its activity can disrupt the development of the spine and circulatory system and cause diseases including leukemia, Alagille syndrome and CADASIL. My recent studies have demonstrated that Notch receptors, ligands (Delta and Jagged), and immediate downstream transcriptional targets (Hes) are present in the developing pituitary, but their function in this system is unknown. The proposed studies will determine if Notch signaling is necessary and sufficient for pituitary cell specification using transgenic and knock-out mice to modulate Notch receptor activity. In addition, the specific role of the Notch pathway gene Hes1, a transcriptional repressor, will be defined through gain and loss of function analysis. Finally, novel downstream targets of Notch activation in the pituitary will be defined by screening the candidates Mash1 and p27. These studies will provide a greater understanding of how the pituitary gland develops to produce hormones that affect growth, fertility and metabolism. They may also reveal genetic causes of congenital pituitary hormone deficiency and pituitary tumorigenesis and offer novel insight into the function of Notch signaling in endocrine cell differentiation."
5774,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, a condition in which cardiac contractile function is impaired without significant coronary artery disease, is an important cause of heart failure and sudden death but poorly understood. Alcohol abuse is considered the most common etiology of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in the United States, but heavy drinkers rarely develop heart failure. In contrast, growing consensus in the published literature supports a primary role for cigarette smoking in the development of chronic cardiac injury. Cigarette smokers are much more likely to drink heavily than nonsmokers, and most alcoholics are dependent on nicotine. Reactive oxygen species originate from gas or tar phases of cigarette smoke, activated macrophages or neutrophils, and from endogenous sources of biological radicals including xanthine oxidase and mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Oxidative stress from cigarette smoke exposure causes lipid peroxidation in heart tissue, impaired energy metabolism, and reduced contractile function. Importantly, cigarette smoke stimulates robust collagen deposition in animal hearts that mimics tissue fibrosis classically associated with human cardiomyopathy. The central hypothesis of the proposed research plan is that chronic exposure to cigarette smoke triggers hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) in cardiac myocytes, which then impairs baseline function and reduces resistance to ethanol-mediated toxicity and acute ischemia-reperfusion injury. Studies will explore a mouse model of cigarette- and alcohol-associated cardiomyopathy with three specific aims. In Specific Aim One, we plan to investigate the individual and combined effects of chronic cigarette smoke exposure and heavy ethanol intake on cardiac structure and function using adult C57BL/6 mice. In Specific Aim Two, we will test the importance of PARP-1 hyperactivation as a mediator of myocardial injury induced by cigarette smoke exposure and heavy ethanol consumption. In Specific Aim Three, we plan to investigate the individual and combined effects of cigarette smoke exposure and heavy ethanol consumption on tissue resistance to acute ischemia-reperfusion injury. Protocols generate cohorts of mice with heart disease that simulates one common form of human cardiomyopathy. We predict the project will generate novel mechanistic insights, allow us to derive biomarker profiles for diagnosis of cigarette-related heart injury, and determine the utility of PARP-1 inhibitors for treatment of cardiac disease caused by drug abuse that is difficult to approach clinically. Heart disease related to cigarette smoking and heavy drinking is an important cause of illness and death throughout the world but difficult to study carefully in patients. Research proposed in this grant application will use mice to learn how cigarette smoking and heavy drinking damage heart muscle and whether a new class of safe medications known as  PARP-1 inhibitors  help hearts recover once drug abuse has ended. Information obtained in these studies will help doctors improve the diagnosis and treatment of chronic heart disease in adult patients who smoke cigarettes and drink in excess."
5788,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for the competitive renewal of the 21st through the 25th year of a training program to provide intensive laboratory training for physicians as well as for Ph.D. We emphasize training of physicians in basic biomedical research, as there are a decreasing number of physicians that enter research careers. The program is a combined effort of several departments at UCSF including the Depts. of Medicine, Pediatrics, Laboratory Medicine, Biochemistry & Biophysics, the Cardiovascular Research Institute and the Cancer Research Institute. Most of the faculty advisors are professors and all have active program research and experience in training fellows. The themes embrace investigations into basic and translational research in hematology, oncology and gene expression. The major topics are: hematological studies including red cell, white cell, platelets and premature distribution of red cells in hematologic anemia, molecular basis of diagnosis and treatment ofhemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, families of receptors on leucocytes, T cell differentiation and response to antigens, megakarocytopoieses, thrombin receptors and a family pf protease activated protein-couple receptors, and signal transduction in hematopoietic cells. Also, prenatal and postnatal treatment of single gene disorders such as thalassemia, and stem cell transplantation in utero will be studied. Two programs in hematologic malignancies are the role of chromosomal translocation in acute promyelocytytic leukemia and the relation between neurofibromatosis 1 and leukemia. Oncological studies include the genetic and biochemical mechanism of tumor progression and growth, oncogene induced apoptosis and therapeutic intervention of cancer cells through signal transduction pathways. Also, studies on the synthesis and function of telomeres and the mechanism of telomerase action as well as the molecular and physiologic pathways of leptin action will be offered. In addition to many of the tools in molecular and cell biology, the trainees will also learn new technologies such as microarrays and comparative genomic hybridization. UCSF has a host of formal lectures and seminars for the trainees including those in the Program in Biological Sciences (PIBS), the Program in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) and the Molecular Medicine Training Program. Thus, the trainees will be exposed to a rich, intellectual and educational environment."
5792,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant proposal will investigate the role of cell-surface central nervous system (CNS)-specific heparan- sulfate and chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs and CSPGs respectively) in human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) neuropathogenesis. The working hypothesis for these studies is that distinct gene- families of cell-associated proteoglycans play a major role in viral capture and transfer via the brain microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs), as we have demonstrated, and other independent investigators have confirmed. In addition, distinct CNS-specific HSPGs may be required for interactions of viral proteins (HIV-1 Tat) with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and CNS-derived cells. SPECIFIC AIM 1 will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which HIV-1 interacts with MVEC-specific cell-associated proteoglycans to cross the BBB and infect CMS. This will be accomplished by: 1). Complete characterization of MVEC-specific cell- associated proteoglycans in our experimental cellular systems in vitro, 2). Analysis of the role of MVEC- specific proteoglycans in HIV-1 entry and infection of the BBB and CNS by means of alternative approaches, such as chemical, enzymatic, monoclonal antibodies, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and anti-sense. 3). Investigating the role of MVEC-specific proteoglycans in HIV-1 infection of CNS by both free-virus and cell- associated (transmigration of HIV-1 infected monocytes/T-cells through the BBB) virus in our in vitro human BBB model. SPECIFIC AIM 2 will study the molecular mechanisms by which HIV-1-specific proteins (HIV-1 Tat) interact with CNS-specific cell-associated HSPGs to enter and affect CNS-derived cells. By employing similar approaches as in specific AIM1 (i.e. enzymatic, monoclonal antibodies, RNAi, and anti-sense oligonucleotides) we will dissect the participation of specific gene-families of HSPGs (syndecans, glypicans, and/or others) in HIV-1 Tat uptake by human brain MVECs, neurons and astrocytes. In addition, as a model in our studies, we will also employ the human K562-cell line, which lacks HSPGs and CSPGs, and will be transfected with different constructs expressing various human proteoglycans, that are available in our labs. Results from these studies should improve our understanding of the role of CNS-specific proteoglycans in HIV-1 entry and infection of the brain, and may provide insights into strategies for controlling HIV-1 neuroinvasion and associated neurodegeneration in infected patients."
5815,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to the emergence of pandemic influenza A viruses. This knowledge is critical to promoting an increasing preparedness for global influenza outbreaks such as the 'Spanish Influenza' of 1918/1919. Recent direct transmission of avian influenza A viruses to Hong Kong residents has increased concern over the generation of a new pandemic strain. An added concern is the potential use of influenza viruses as bioterrorism agents. The proposed research takes advantage of a plasmid-based reverse genetics system, developed in the applicant's laboratory, to generate influenza viruses entirely from cloned cDNA. Aim 1 seeks to define the contributions of the 1918 influenza virus HA and NA genes to the unprecedented virulence of this strain, focusing on receptor specificity/affinity and fusion activity of the HA and on the sialidase activity of the NA.  Aim 2 investigates the cellular and molecular basis of life-threatening lung hemorrhage associated with a 1918-like recombinant virus in mice, testing a multifactorial hypothesis that involves cytokine expression levels, neutrophil-mediated injury, and coagulation defects, all stemming from viral infection. Aim 3 tests complementary hypotheses that would explain the generation of new pandemic virus lineages and viral adaptation to human host cells. That is, 'mutator mutants' (viruses with error-prone polymerase complexes) are predicted to generate greater-than-normal genetic variability in the viral population, yielding mutants optimally adapted to their host. This concept will be evaluated by comparing the mutation rates of isolates that founded new lineages with those of their descendent viruses. Second, host environments conducive to adaptive changes may be required before wild waterfowl viruses can be transmitted to humans. The role of land-based poultry as an intermediate host will be tested by passaging viruses, isolated from waterfowl, in chickens or quail and then determining any adaptive changes in HA receptor binding and NA sialidase activity, both of which are critical determinants of host range restriction. Collectively, these studies will help to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying the emergence of new (pandemic) influenza A virus lineages, a crucial step in combating future threats from this virus."
5829,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammation is increasingly recognized to play a central role in atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, and peripheral blood markers of inflammation have been associated with cardiac events. The relationship of these potentially modifiable risk markers to ischemic stroke risk is less clear. Additional epidemiological studies have suggested that the burden of past exposure to common infectious diseases may be one of the factors contributing to increased levels of inflammation. The proposed research study will capitalize on the on-going Northern Manhattan Study (N INDS R01 29993, PI RL S acco), a prospective cohort study of stroke risk factors in a multi-ethnic urban population, to test the following hypotheses: (1) high-sensitivity C -reactive protein and other inflammatory markers (serum amyloid A, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor receptor levels) are independent risk factors for (a) ischemic stroke and (b) ot her vascular outcomes in whites, blacks and Hispanics; (2) the burden of common infectious serologies (C. pneumoniae, H.pylori, CMV, EBV, HSV 1 and 2) is an independent risk factor for stroke and other vascular outcomes in these populations; (3) these inflammatory and infectious marker s are associated with sub-clinical vascular brain diseases seen on MRI scanning, such as white matter hyperintensities and silent infarcts. Levels of these markers will be measured using nephelometric and immunoassay techniques on stored baseline serum samples from 2000 of 3298 initially stroke-free subjects, of whom 1400 will undergo MRI scanning as part of the parent project. Follow-up serum samples will also be collected on these 1400 participants. Outcomes of ischemic stroke, total stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular mortality and total mortality will be ascertained. Cox proportional hazard model analysis will be used to assess the significance of the main exposure variables after adjustment for other risk factors, and inflammatory and infectious markers will be analyzed as time dependen t covariates when follow up values are available. The cross-sectional associations between inflammatory and infectious markers and quantitative MRI abnormalities will also be assessed."
5846,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge for collaborative research on the neurobiology of alcoholism is the need to bring together data across all levels of biological scale from multiple strains and species to address questions about relations among biological processes and behaviors. Deep analytic integration is possible for planned experiments, reference populations and reference protocols. However, in a large and diverse consortium and extending to the biological research community, such integration is typically unobtainable. Knowledge synthesis and qualitative shifts in approach to the nerubiology of alcoholism requires highly interdisciplinary individuals who have mastered multiple literatures. This challenge can be addressed through application of recent developments in bioinformatics and advances in graph algorithms for global analysis of empirically defined gene-to- phenotype relations. We will create an archive of gene-to-phenotype relations, and use graph algorithms to discover the naturally occurring sets, subsets and supersets of phenotypes and genes. This scale, scope and complexity of this problem will be tackled by exploiting advances in high-performance supercomputing, database design and graph algorithms. This purely empirical approach to the development of gene and phenotype ontologies is designed to extract emergent new knowledge from the wealth of genome-phenome association data, in addition to describing what is known. The archive will be initially populated using our existing resources and from new project data collected by members of the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism Consortium (INIA). Cross-species integration will be achieved through the use of gene homology. We will also develop an open-source, open-access Web based  Ontological Discovery System  for access to the data archive, analytic method and results by members of the INIA consortium and the alcohol research community at large. Using this tool, investigators will be able to start a query with sets of genes or phenotypes of interest and interactively explore their relations to other entities in the data archive to discover highly similar biological categories and to organize knowledge about the many facets of alcohol related phenotypes and their relation to the broader context of neural pathways and systems. This development work will occur in the context of a team of expert colleagues who will be capable of testing software, sharing data, performing biological interpretation and validating results of our analyses."
5860,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian retina is composed of a diverse mixture of cell types with distinct functional roles (e.g. photoreceptors and multiple types of interneurons). The properties of distinct retinal cell types appear to be specified by different underlying patterns of gene expression, but the mechanisms that establish and maintain specific patterns of gene expression in individual retinal cell types are only partially understood. The recent discovery of an abundant class of small RNA regulatory molecules in animals, microRNAs (miRNAs), provides a potential novel regulatory mechanism for retinal cell diversification. Although several hundred miRNAs have been found to be expressed in the mammalian nervous system, recent computational searches for genes that encode miRNAs, as well as sequencing of miRNAs expressed in mammalian brain, suggest that numerous mammalian miRNAs remain to be identified. Genetic studies in the nematode C. elegans have identified miRNAs that control the identity of specific neurons and some of these miRNAs are expressed in very small populations of cells. If similar miRNAs, restricted to specific cell types, exist in the mammalian retina, those miRNAs from less abundant cell types will represent a small fraction of all miRNAs and therefore are unlikely to have been identified to date.     The specific goals of the proposed project are to create an extensive profile of miRNAs expressed in the adult and neonatal mouse retina, to identify miRNAs that are restricted to specific retinal cell types or subtypes, and to identify retinal miRNAs with altered expression in the retinal degeneration 1 (Pde6brd1) mouse mutant, a model of human retinitis pigmentosa. miRNAs will be identified by extensive or deep sequencing, using a massively parallel sequencing technology. Several million short RNAs from adult and neonatal wild-type retinas and from adult Pde6brd1 retinas will be sequenced (>1000-fold deeper sequencing than prior analyses of retinal miRNAs). Sequences will be computationally analyzed to identify known and novel miRNAs and to exclude other RNAs. The miRNAs identified in the retina will be further characterized using recently developed miRNA in situ hybridization techniques. Based upon the frequency of different cell types in the retina, the deep sequencing of retinal miRNAs should allow the identification of miRNAs restricted to low abundance retinal cell types, as well as the generation of a comprehensive profile of miRNAs expressed in the retina. The proposed studies are intended to provide a framework for understanding miRNA expression and function in the mammalian retina. Identification of cell-type specific and other miRNAs in the retina will provide new genes that can be considered as candidates for human retinal diseases. In addition, expression of cell-type specific miRNAs may be subject to modulation in retinal diseases."
5871,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Tuberculosis remains a serious health concern. A major virulence property of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for this disease, is the ability to survive and grow within macrophages. M. tuberculosis proteins that are exported out from the cytoplasm to the bacterial surface or are further secreted into the environment are ideally positioned to interact with the host and combat macrophage defenses. Many of the M. tuberculosis proteins in this subcellular exported category remain to be identified or studied. We recently developed a genetic reporter system for monitoring protein export directly in M. tuberculosis. In this system a truncated ?-lactamase enzyme, which is not exported on its own, is fused to proteins to report on their export beyond the cytoplasm. Because ?- lactam antibiotics target cell wall synthesis enzymes, the ?-lactamase reporter must be exported in order to protect bacteria from these drugs. We demonstrated this system to function properly in a ?-lactam sensitive mutant of M. tuberculosis. In this R21 application we propose to use a modified Himar mariner transposon which carries a ?-lactamase reporter, Tn'blaTEM-1, to select for in-frame transposon insertions in M. tuberculosis genes encoding exported proteins. This genetic approach has the advantage of simultaneously identifying exported proteins and generating M. tuberculosis transposon insertion mutants in the corresponding genes. The resulting transposon mutant library will be screened for intracellular growth defects in macrophages and for defects in the M. tuberculosis inhibition of macrophage responses. This research will complement existing genomic approaches while uncovering new virulence factors, which should aid development of new disease intervention strategies.     Tuberculosis is a severe world health problem. A virulence property of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of this disease, is the ability to survive and grow in macrophages. The proposed research will identify new virulence factors that enable M. tuberculosis to survive in macrophages and cause disease"
5873,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite great strides in understanding the mechanisms of acute bacterial disease, the mechanisms involved in chronic disease - persistence in an otherwise healthy host - are far less known. Chronic bacterial infections are a major public health problem because infected individuals appear healthy, but often shed bacteria, causing outbreaks or epidemics of acute infection. Using a mouse model of chronic bacterial infection, we have discovered that salmonellae reside within a particular kind of macrophage, cytophagocytic macrophages, that have ingested live white blood cells. These are similar to macrophages that can harbor salmonellae in humans with typhoid fever and that are referred to as  typhoidal cells . We now want to identify the molecular mechanisms that enable the bacteria to survive within cytophagocytic macrophages. To this end, we developed a tissue culture model of our in vivo observations which recapitulates the replication of bacteria inside of macrophages that have ingested live, but not dead, white blood cells grown in the laboratory. In this highly focused proposal we outline 3 questions with which we will exploit this model to identify the molecular mechanisms of persistent infection. 1.) Are bacteria vacuolar or cytosolic when they replicate within macrophages that have ingested live white blood cells? 2.) What contributions do the live white blood cells and/or S. typhimurium make that allow the bacteria to replicate? 3.) Is the activation state of macrophages altered by the ingestion of live white blood cells and/or bacteria to allow for bacterial replication? These studies will lay the foundation for molecular analyses of the signaling pathways that allow for bacterial replication in cytophagocytic macrophages.  This proposal is relevant to public health because it addresses a poorly understood issue of major medical importance: how and where do bacteria survive during chronic infection. Once these questions have been addressed, therapeutics that clear chronic bacterial infections can be developed, reducing the frequency/severity of epidemics of acute bacterial infection."
5877,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The present proposal investigates age-related deficits in eye-hand coordination during aiming movements. In our everyday life, we frequently and efficiently interact with objects by making goal-directed movements (reaching, grasping, pointing, and tracking with a computer mouse). Such movements often involve concurrent processing of both the eyes and the hands to complete the task. Thus, declines in the ability of eye-hand coordination will cause difficulties in daily life of older adults. Slowness and large variability are well-known declines in motor behaviors of older adults. Older adults are known to rely heavily on visual feedback while performing motor tasks, which often results in movement slowing as shown by longer deceleration phases in the velocity profile. However, it is not known whether older adults have difficulties controlling and coordinating eye movements concurrently with arm movements. Due to age-related deficits in motor performance with high visuo-motor demands, it is predicted that older adults have a decreased capability to control and coordinate eye and hand movements. The present project is designed as a series of pilot studies that will demonstrate and identify the specific nature of the deficits of eye-hand coordination in older adults. The purpose is to investigate (1) whether basic characteristics of eye movements and coordination patterns between eye and hand movements are altered in older adults compared with young during pre- planned aiming movements (Experiment 1), and (2) whether the characteristics and the coordination patterns in response to unexpected perturbations differ in older adults compared with young adults (Experiment 2). The obtained data will create a basis for more detailed long-term future research involving age-related deficits in eye-hand coordination and learning capabilities of older adults to compensate for these deficits. This study is important as it contributes in determining the underlying mechanisms for deterioration of goal-directed movements in aging."
5881,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative and ultimately fatal dementia. Synaptic loss has been demonstrated to be the anatomic substrate underlying the onset of dementia in patients. However, the pathological mechanism of synapse loss remains elusive. The burden of oligomers of ?-amyloid (A?) is a strong inverse correlate of synapse loss in AD patients. AD extract containing natural oligomers typically attack post synapse and the AD extract induces amyloidogenesis in animals. Oligomers of A? target Shank protein, which is an organizer of glutamate receptors in post synapse, was shown to be involved in pathological change in AD. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that human natural pathogenic oligomers of A? trigger catastrophic accumulation of toxic oligomers, and destruct synaptic integrity between Shank proteins and glutamate receptors underlying synapse loss in AD. Needs addressed by this proposal:  A major concern is whether the natural dodecamers of A? (12-mer) from human AD brain induce oligomer accumulation and amyloidogenesis in vivo/vitro, and destroy synaptic function. AIM 1:  Test the hypothesis that pathological 12-mer triggers catastrophic accumulation of toxic 12-mer in vivo and in vitro. AIM 2:  Test the prediction that oligomers of A? trigger Shank-postsynaptic platform collapse resulting in loss of synaptic structure and function. To characterize human oligomers of A?, we have developed methods to isolate oligomers of A? from human AD brain under native conditions. The proposed experiments will explore a new biological activity of natural oligomers from AD brain tissue. If successful, this study will also identify new therapeutic targets which will open novel ways to neutralize this neurotoxin and protect synaptic function."
5909,HHS,NSF,"The proposed research will be conducted by Dr. Carlos Ramos, primarily in Campinas, Brazil, at theBrazilian Synchrotron Laboratory (LNLS), in collaboration with Dr. Douglas Cyrof the Department of CellBiolog at UNC-Chapel Hill. The parent grant held by Dr. Cyr GM R01 NIH R01GM56981 is focused onunderstanding the mechansims by which Hsp40 proteins regulate Hsp70 action in cell stress. This FIRCAaward seeks to extend the aims of the parent grant and previous work of Dr. Ramos to study themechansims by which Type I and Type II Hsp40s specify the cellular functions of Hsp70. One goal of this proposal is to determine the structural elements that control the quaternary structure ofType I and Type II Hsp40s. Dr. Cyr has demonstrated that Type I and Type II Hsp40s exhibit differences insubstrate specificity and protein folding activity that control the cellular function of Hsp70. However, themechansim for Hsp40 action as a protein folding factor is unknown. Dr. Ramos has demonstrated that Type Iand Type II Hsp40 proteins and have grossly different quaternary strucutres, which may account for thefunctional differences exhibited by these co-chaperones. In this aims we set of defined to experiments todefine the features that control the quaternary strucuture. To accomlish this goal the Ramos laboratory willutilize small angle X-ray scattering, cross-linking and and analytic ultracentrafugation to study the quaternarystrucutres of Hsp40s. At present we have high resolution structural information on fragments of Hsp70 and Hsp40, but there islittle information that describes contacts formed between Hsp70 and Hsp40 during the process of proteinfolding. Since the field has not have been able to obtain high resolution structural data to describeHsp70/Hsp40 interactions, as a second goal we propose to utilize SASX and cross-linking/massspectroscopy approaches to build such models. Then we will test the predictions made from these modelsby designing mutants and testing there activity in in vivo and in vitro functional assays. These data willdetermine the mechanism by which Type I and Type II Hsp40s interact with Hsp70 to suppress proteinaggregation and facilitate protein folding/assembly."
5920,HHS,HHS,"Although aberrant signaling through various Rac isoforms has been conceptually associated with manyaspects of cancer cell biology, there,remains a significant gap in our knowledge on the mechanism ofcontribution by Rac GTPases to cancer development. To date few animal models are available to directlystudy the involvement of Rac GTPases in cancer in vivo. Limited information obtained from human cancerspecimen screening suggest that upregulation of expression or activity, but rarely mutation, of Rac GTPasesare associated with a wide spectrum of human tumors, raising the possibility that Rac might serve as signalmodifier or mediator of primary genetic or mitogenic  hits  in tumor induction and progression. The p53tumor suppressor pathway, on the other hand, constitutes a check point in cell cycle progression that isresponsive to proliferative signals normally required for cell growth. Disruption of p53 leads tolymphomagenesis in mice, and loss of gene function in p53 pathway is a common feature in many humancancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma. Our preliminary studies demonstrating that Rac activities areinversely regulated by p53 functional expression and are required for the p53 controlled cell growth ortransformation in primary MEFs and murine lymphocytes/lymphoma lead to the central hypothesis of thisproposal that Rac GTPase signaling constitutes a novel target in p53 deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis.This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that Rac activities are inversely regulated by the p53functional status of human Burkitt's lymphoma cells that carries c-myc and p53 defects and are required forthe proliferation phenotype of the tumor cells. In addition, by structure-function based rational design wehave developed a Rac-specific small molecule inhibitor that is effective in suppressing Rac activity inlymphoid and lymphoma cells and other tumor cells. Thus we propose three specific aims to implicate RacGTPases as useful targets in p53 deficiency-mediated lymphomagenesis. (1) To define the role of individualRac GTPases by using Rac1, Rac2, and/or Rac3 knockout hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in the p53-/-or the Eu-myc/p53+/- genetic background in a bone-marrow transplantation protocol. (2) To analyze theeffectiveness of a Rac-specific small molecule inhibitor, NSC23766, in preventing p53 deficiency-inducedlymphomagenesis in mice. (3) To apply the Rac targeting strategy established in the murine lymphomamodel to the studies of p53 deficient human Burkitt's lymphoma cells. The goals of these studies are toimplicate the functional connection between the p53 tumor suppressor and Rac GTPase signaling pathwaysin p53 deficient mouse and human lymphoma models and to validate Rac signaling as a useful anti-cancertarget. The results are likely relevant to future design of targeted therapies toward a variety of humancancers."
5959,HHS,NSF,"In normal human skin, melanocytes are tightly regulated by surrounding keratinocytes, which determinemelanocyte growth, expression of cell surface molecules, and cell shape. This dominance of keratinocytesover the melanocytes is lost during transformation, allowing melanoma cells to invade into the dermis. Bystudying cell-cell communication between normal melanocytes and keratinocytes, we are beginning tounderstand how melanoma cells have escaped from keratinocytes' control. We now expand for normalhuman skin the homeostatic concept of growth, differentiation, and survival or death and include stem cells asa continuing source for differentiated, pigment-producing melanocytes. As model systems we usemelanocytes differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (NIH cell line codes WA01 and WA09) andprogenitor cells of the human hair follicle. The working hypothesis in the first aim is that cadherin-mediatedcell-cell interactions determine self-renewal of multi-potent progenitor, oligo-potent precursor and committedmelanocyte stem cells whereas cell-matrix interactions drive differentiation. Using a three-dimensional modelof normal human skin with a 'dermis' of fibroblasts embedded in collagen and an 'epidermis' withmelanocytes and multi-layered keratinocytes, we will determine whether proper positioning of maturemelanocytes at the basement membrane is controlled by integrin D6B1 and matricellular protein CCN3 andwhether improper activation of cell-cell signaling genes such as Notchl leads to transformation. Ourhypothesis is that melanocyte precursor and stem cells are more prone to transformation than mature,pigment-producing melanocytes. Using culture conditions developed for human embryonic stem cells, wehave for aim 2 isolated melanoma cells from patients' lesions that have stem cell-like characteristics anddifferentiate into melanogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic cell lineages. These 'melanomastem cells' represent a minor tumorigenic population and are characterized by the expression of the B cellmarker CD20. We will determine whether and how cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions regulate the CD20-defined melanoma stem cell population and how CD20 can be optimally targeted for melanoma therapy.These studies will demonstrate how dysregulation of homeostasis results in tumor formation and targetingsubpopulations of malignant cells leads to successful therapy."
5996,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiotherapy remains as a major component of treatment modalities for controlling tumor progression and the majority of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors recur within or at the margin of the radiation field. The unexpected biological effect of irradiation involves an altered profile of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity and provides evidence of a scenario where irradiation might promote angiogenic and invasion-related gene expression, thereby increasing invasive and angiogenic glioma cell behavior. To elucidate the interactions between radiation and MMPs in glioblastomas, we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Determine the effects of irradiation on MMPs/TEMPs in human endothelial and glioblastoma cells, a) Increases in MMP expression and activity during radiation therapy have potential therapeutic implications. We will determine the effects of radiation and glioblastoma-endothelial interactions on MMPs/TIMPs expression, secretion and angiogenesis in vitro in endothelial cells, b) Increased expression and activity of MMPs in irradiated tumor and endothelial cells will be modulated by antagonists and antisense RNAs of MMP-2 and MMP-9 through expression plasmids and adenoviral vectors and will be evaluated in co-cultures for the modulation of angiogenesis in vitro in endothelial cells with and without irradiation. Specific Aim 2. Determine the effects of antisense MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibition on glioma angiogenesis in vivo. Malignant glioma is one of the most radioresistant tumor types and tumor vascular endothelium is resilient to cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation. In this aim, we will study the effect of a) adenoviral-mediated antisense suppression of MMP-9 expression under the control of a radiation-responsive (Erg/CMV) chimeric promoter with and without radiation treatment and b) adenoviral-mediated antisense suppression of MMP-9 expression under the control of an endothelial-specific (flt-1) promoter on tumor growth delay, microvessel density, apoptotic index and relative MMPs/TIMPs levels in tumors during tumor growth in the mouse brain. The proposed studies should generate major insights into the pathogenesis of radiation-induced alterations in GBM tumors and, in turn, demonstrate that MMPs inhibition during radiotherapy may represent a new therapeutic approach in improving the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy for malignant gliomas."
6002,HHS,NSF,"This project is designed to investigate the efficacy of combination treatment of marrow stromal cells (MSCs)and statins (simvastatin) in improving functional outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Our previousstudies have shown that MSCs have a beneficial effect after TBI in rats. To augment the therapeutic benefitof MSCs a combination therapy of MSCs with simvastatin has been designed. Female Wistar rats will beinjured using the controlled cortical impact model of head trauma. After injury, simvastatin will beadministered orally, and MSCs harvested from male adult rats will be injected into the tail vein of the rats. Tocompare the efficacy of combination treatment (MSC + simvastatin) with MSC and simvastatinmonotherapies other group of rats will be administered either MSCs or simvastatin, solely. The functionaloutcome of rats will be monitored with a battery of tests, and animals will be sacrificed at different timepoints. Brain sections will be stained with immunohistochemistry and MSCs will be identified by localizing Ychromosomes within them. The induction of brain plasticity with treatment will be measured by studyingneurogenesis, synaptogenesis and angiogenesis. In addition, growth factors which are mediators of thisplasticity will be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the treatment combiningMSCs with simvastatin is found to be more effective than monotherapy, this will increase the clinicalrelevance of MSC treatment by allowing us to use smaller and safer doses."
6033,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the cause of infectious mononucleosis and is also associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, a subset of gastric carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and malignancies such as primary central nervous system lymphoma in AIDS patients.  EBV is a ubiquitous virus that establishes a life-long latent infection in B cells and is associated B cell, T cell and epithelial cell malignancies.  EBV has both latent and lytic phases to its life cycle.  EBV latency genes are expressed in EBV associated malignancies.  EBV lytic replication is required for virus spread from one individual to the next and is also a factor in maintenance of life-time infection within an individual.  Regulation of latent and lytic EBV promoters has been studied extensively in reporter assays and in EBV immortalized B cell lines in culture.  However, the biology of EBV infection of the epithelial cell and the conditions that favor a latent versus a lytic outcome are poorly understood.  The recent availability of recombinant EBV expressing GFP and drug selection markers, new epithelial cell lines and improved sources of infectious virus now make it feasible to address the parameters that regulate the outcome of EBV infection of epithelial cells.  With regards to B cell infection, integrating the data acquired on EBV promoter regulation in B cell lines with in vivo EBV biology has been handicapped by a lack of accessible animal models. The Specific Aims of this application address these issues and are: Aim 1. To identify conditions that favor latent versus lytic EBV infection in epithelial cells using GFP expressing EBV virus and immortalized epithelial cell lines.  Aim 2. To evaluate the contribution of the BART encoded RPMS protein to establishment of infection and lytic DNA replication.  RPMS interactors identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen will provide experimental direction for the studies.  Aim 3. To develop a mouse model for in vivo evaluation of EBV promoter expression using hematopoietic reconstitution with lentiviral transduced stem cells."
6038,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a training program for the development of career in aging research. The PI completed a post-doctoral fellowship in C. elegans genetics, and for the last three years has run a small lab studying meiotic recombination. This proposal addresses the Pi's desire to develop a new program of research within her lab, taking the expertise she already has on meiosis and applying it to the study of reproductive aging. The training program will draw on the expertise of Drs. Catherine Wolkow of the National Institute of Aging and Kerry Kornfeld of Washington University, who actively study different aspects of C. elegans aging, and Dr. Doug Koshland of the Carnegie Institution who is a leader in the field chromosome behavior. In addition, Dr. Andy Golden of NIDDK and Dr. Valerie Reinke will provide technical training in live cell imaging of meiosis and of microarrays, respectively. The research focuses on reproductive decline associated with aging in the nematode, C. elegans. Defects in chromosome segregation during gamete formation appear with age in both C. elegans and humans. In females, this leads to a significant increase (>15-fold) in aneuploid oocytes by age 40, and in males, a decrease in sperm count. Despite the clinical importance of research in this field, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for changes in the fidelity of meiotic chromosome segregation. The prodigous progress made in the fields of aging and meiosis by research in C. elegans underscores the use of this system to address fundamental questions related to germ line aging. The specific aims include: 1) characterizing meiosis during normal aging in C. elegans; 2) Analyzing aging pathways for their role in germ line aging; and 3) identifying germ line genes that respond to aging cues. The Carnegie Institution provide a superb setting for the training of young scientists by creating an environment that fosters interaction between scientists and by providing opportunities for professional development. In addition, the proximity of Carnegie to the National Institute of Aging will provide additional opportunities for the PI to interact with scientists in the aging field through participation in a local invertebrate aging research group and attendance at seminars on that campus. This training program should allow the PI to establish a strong research program in the aging field as she prepares for her future academic career."
6070,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent depression is a major public health problem in the United States and throughout the world. Major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescence is common with point prevalence rates of 3% to 9%. In the U.S., it is estimated that by the time adolescents reach the age of 17, 14% will have experienced at least one episode of major depressive disorder. Effective treatments of adolescent depression are clearly needed despite the fact that in the past 10-15 years, there has been a dramatic increase in studies of the efficacy of medications, primarily the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Medications and CBT rarely result in complete and lasting remission of symptoms, and residual symptoms are associated with a high rate of relapse. In most studies, a positive response is defined as a 30-50% improvement in symptoms and/or a global rating that the subject is much or very much improved. In adults, exercise has been used as a mono-therapy and as an augmentation therapy with antidepressant medication. Our recently completed randomized trial of exercise treatment in adults found response and remission rates of 46% and 42%, in those randomized to a public health dose of exercise. In adolescents, data on the use of exercise to treat MDD is relatively sparse. A 2006 Cochrane review of exercise to prevent and treat depression in adolescents found a small effect size in support of exercise, but the conclusion is based on evidence from a small number of randomized clinical trials of low methodological quality. In this exploratory R34, the specific aims of this application are to: 1) Develop a detailed Manual of Procedures (MOP) to conduct an acute-phase randomized trial of exercise to treat adolescent depression; 2) Develop estimates of recruitment yield from tests of various recruitment strategies; and, 3) Pilot test trial methodologies in (n=40) adolescents diagnosed with depression to ascertain estimates of treatment effect sizes, adherence and drop-out rates. To achieve these aims, the project is organized into 3 phases. Phase I will be the development of the first draft MOP that will adapt procedures developed from a previous trial examining two doses of exercise in treatment of adult MDD. Phase II will test specific recruitment methodologies to determine recruitment yields for each strategy and will pilot test screening procedures developed in Phase I. Phase III will be a pilot test of the intervention and will include development of baseline and outcome measures of exercise and depression; development and implementation of the experimental exercise treatment; and determination of the effects of exercise on depressive symptoms. Following the pilot study, we will finalize all procedures for the MOP and obtain estimates of effect sizes, adherence and drop out rates. These data will allow us to specify all study procedures necessary to meet standards of high methodological quality for a future, larger-scale, controlled study of exercise in depressed youth and will provide us with needed experience. Additionally, the results of the pilot study will enable us to more precisely quantify sample sizes for a future R01 application. This pilot study may yield important research findings on how to adapt exercise treatment for depression among adolescents. Potential public health benefits from this study include a reduction of adolescent depression and problems associated with untreated depression in young adults including suicide, substance abuse, cigarette smoking, teen pregnancy, impaired psychosocial functioning and school failure. In addition, because this study prescribes physical activity as a treatment for depression, additional public health benefits may include a reduction in chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease, all of which are associated with sedentary behavior."
6087,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States, with over 36,000 new cases diagnosed each year. A substantial fraction of these tumors arise on a background of endometrial hyperplasia. Two major risk factors for the development of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma have been identified, one of which is genetic and the other environmental. An inherited defect in DNA mismatch repair confers a approximately 50% lifetime risk for the development of endometrial carcinoma. Estrogens (both exogenous and endogenous) increase a woman's risk for the development of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. We and others have demonstrated that somatic (acquired) defects in mismatch repair are frequent in endometrial cancer, further emphasizing the importance of loss of DNA mismatch repair in these tumors. The synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), has been shown to induce reproductive tract malignancies in humans and mice. At this time, however, little is known about how estrogenic stimulation and loss of mismatch repair interact in endometrial tumorigenesis. We propose to define the roles that DNA mismatch repair and DES play in endometrial tumorigenesis through investigation of a mouse model. Mice that are +/+, +/- and -/- for a Mlh1 knockout allele will be exposed to the synthetic estrogen, DES. The age-specific penetrance and expressivity of DES-induced reproductive tract abnormalities will be determined for the three different genotypes. The cellular phenotypes will be described histologically and at the molecular level. Expression array studies will be used to define genetic signatures (transcriptomes) for the normal endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia and frank carcinoma. Comparison of the global changes in gene expression in cancers and precancerous lesions will provide insights into the genetic changes that are associated with phenotypic progression. Furthermore, comparison of DES-promoted cancers lacking mismatch repair with those that have normal DNA mismatch repair will point to pathways that are disrupted in mismatch repair deficient cancers. The results of these studies will provide the basis for future experiments into the molecular mechanisms by which estrogens and loss of mismatch repair contribute to endometrial tumor formation. The improved understanding of the molecular basis of uterine endometrial tumorigenesis will provide avenues for the prevention, detection and treatment of these malignancies and other hormonally promoted and responsive cancers."
6103,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a debilitating condition affecting between 8 and 12 million people in the United States. Patients with PAD of the lower extremities are subject to periods of intermittent claudication pain. Gait changes such as reduced stride length, cadence and walking speed are reported in patients with PAD. Walking exercise has been prescribed as the primary mode of rehabilitative treatment in patients with PAD. An enhanced form of walking exercise, polestriding, has been found to improve rehabilitation outcomes for patients with PAD. Walking with poles also increases stride length, cadence and walking speed and decreases ground reaction forces on the joints. Changes in walking mechanics secondary to walking pole use may allow more time for perfusion of the leg muscles thus delaying the onset of and decreasing the severity of ischemic pain. Thus, we hypothesize that polestriding may be superior to walking exercise in the rehabilitation of persons with PAD. The two therapies however, have never been compared in a randomized trial in this population. Specific Aims: The primary specific aim is to compare the effects of a 24-week walking versus polestriding exercise in patients with PAD on exercise endurance, perceived physical function and walking abilities. The secondary aim is to explore biomechanical and physiologic mechanisms to explain the expected differences observed in the polestriding and walking groups. Mechanistic variables include perceived claudication pain, gait biomechanics, tissue oxygenation in the most severely affected leg and daily physical activity. Design: A randomized, controlled clinical trial will be used to compare the effects of polestriding and walking exercise. 180 patients will be enrolled in the study to randomize 126 (n=63 in each group). Baseline testing will consist of treadmill exercise, completion of functional assessment questionnaires, gait analysis, and physical activity measurement. Subjects will then be randomized to a 24-week walking or polestriding program. Subjects will exercise three times weekly for 30-60 minutes. Duration and intensity of exercise will be systematically increased. Subjects will be re-tested at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. A final testing battery will be completed at 32 weeks to assess how well subjects have maintained fitness gains. Analysis: Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA and linear regression analysis. Potential co-variates such as smoking and medication use will be monitored and analyzed."
6141,HHS,NSF,"KAI1/CD82 is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily and has been re-discovered as a cancermetastasis suppressor. But the mechanism of the KAI1/CD82-mediated suppression of cancer metastasis still remains unclear. Similar to other tetraspanins, KAI1/CD82 has been reported to regulate cell migration and cancer cell invasiveness. Our studies indicate that: 1) restoration of the KAI1/CD82 expression in prostate cancer cells inhibits cell motility, 2) the FAK-p130CAS/CrK-paxillin signaling pathway is required for KAI1/CD82-mediated suppression of prostate cancer cell motility, 3) KAI1/CD82 disrupts the formation of motility-related subcellular structures such as focal adhesion and cortical actin network, 4) KASP (or EWI2/PGRL), a novel Ig superfamily protein, was identified as a KAI1/CD82-binding protein, and 5) KASP (or EWI2/PGRL) functionally coordinates with KAI 1/CD82 in cell migration. Therefore, we hypothesize that the KAI1/CD82-mediated suppression of cancer metastasis depends on its inhibition of cell motility through 1) regulating the intracellular signaling pathways that control cell movement, and 2) participating the transmembrane complex that is involved in cell movement. So, we propose to first define the structural and functional elements in KAI1/CD82 molecule responsible for the inhibition of cell motility and invasiveness. In particular, the roles of specific biochemical features such as acylation, internalization, and KASP (or EWl2/PGRL) association in cancer cell motility and invasiveness will be determined, in order to conclusively link a specific biochemical feature of KAI1/CD82 to its inhibition of cell motility. Second, we will assess therole of KASP (or EWI2/PGRL) in KAI1/CD82-mediated suppression of cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Third, we will assess how the biochemical feature(s) required for the motility-inhibition affects cell motility by analyzing cell motility-related cellular functions such as adhesion, spreading, and vesicle trafficking and cell motility-related molecular signaling. Together, these studies will identify the mechanism responsible for the KAI1/CD82-mediated suppression of cancer metastasis. Understanding the mechanistic roles of KAI1/CD82 in cancer cell motility will promises to lead to the development of therapeutics capable of specially inhibitingcancer metastasis."
6148,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of the Human Genome Project was to determine the sequence of the 3 billion  genetic elements , or nucleotides, that make up the human genome. The human sequence of the human genome is of enormous value and promises to revolutionize biological research and clinical medicine. It also comes with the realization that the complete genome sequence is only a beginning in our understanding of human biology. One of the greatest mysteries is the regulation of genes present within each cell. Despite being genetically identical, cells from different tissues look differently and perform very different functions. For example, although dopamine system genes are present in the cells of brain, muscle, and skin, such genes are active in neurons but not in muscle or skin cells. It is now believed that tissue-specific expression is achieved by the epigenetic regulation of genes via processes such as DNA methylation. More specifically, one of the nucleotides, namely cytosine, can be present in two functional states methylated or unmethylated. Methylated cytosines are sometimes referred as the 5th base of human DNA. DNA methylation profiles are highly variable across different cells, even in the same organism, and such variation depends on tissue, age, sex, diet, and numerous other factors. Over the last decade a series of new methods have been developed to investigate DNA methylation profiles across large DNA regions - chromosomes and even entire genomes. Unfortunately, all these methods exhibit significant limitations as they require large amounts of DNA, interrogate only a small fraction of methylatable nucleotides or are able to scan only short DNA fragments.     This project is dedicated to development of a new technology for genome wide DNA methylation, or methylome, analysis. The key innovation consists of a combination of two powerful technologies: targeted deposition of extended groups of biopolymers on DNA, and the application of microarrays. Engineered DNA methyltrasferases, enzymes that methylate DNA, will be used to attach fluorescent labels on unmethylated cytosines, and these labeled DNA fragments will be interrogated on tiling microarrays. Microarrays are small pieces of glass containing millions of short DNA sequences that will hybridize to and highlight the unmethylated DNA fragments. This new approach exhibits numerous advantages over the existing methods for DNA methylation profiling in terms of simplicity, sensitivity, informativeness, and robustness. This technology may significantly contribute to our understanding of development, tissue differentiation, aging, and the molecular basis of complex disease, among numerous other fundamental questions of the life sciences."
6188,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acupuncture is an ancient Eastern healing modality that is currently gaining popularity in the West as an 'alternative' therapy. However, little is known about its biological mechanisms in humans. The proposed investigation will non-invasively map the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural activity supporting acupuncture stimulation in humans through the use of anatomically constrained magnetoencephalography (MEG). First, we will spatiotemporally map event-related brain response underlying acupuncture stimulation and compare these responses with those occurring to sham acupuncture control. We will also spatiotemporal map changes in oscillatory brain responses during verum and sham procedures as well as rest. Finally, we will determine if MEG responses are correlated with subjective deqi ratings and/or changes in sympathovagal balance. The use of anatomically constrained MEG to spatiotemporally map brain response to acupuncture is novel and there are currently no published data utilizing this imaging modality or strategy. We anticipate that the proposed investigation will provide a foundation for future investigations in chronic pain populations.    The requested award would provide the candidate with the resources necessary to become a successful independent researcher. The 5 year research and educational plan outlined will allow the candidate to increase her understanding of functional neuroimaging and develop her knowledge of acupuncture and its neurophysiological mechanisms of action. Importantly, the candidate would gain new expertise in a number of areas critical for conducting the proposed research project. These areas include acupuncture theory/practice, somatosensory signal transduction, autonomic nervous system function and physiological monitoring. The candidate would be conducting these studies in a world renowned MRI and MEG neuroimaging facility. Furthermore, proximity to institutes devoted to the study of complimentary therapies such as the Osher Institute, New England School of Acupuncture and Spaulding Rehabilitation Center will allow the candidate to interact with and learn from experienced acupuncture researchers. This proposal aligns with the NCCAM mission statement and strategic plan to explore CAM healing practices in the context of rigorous science as well as train CAM researchers and elucidate mechanisms of action underlying CAM practices. This proposal also aligns with NIH PA-06-001."
6209,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In just the last decade, studies of multisensory processing have doubled all preceding efforts and a multitude of behavioral and perceptual manifestations have already been documented. It is widely accepted that differences in these final products of neural processing depend on differences in the arrangement and weighting of relevant neural inputs. However, investigations into the neural bases for multisensory processing have been relatively uncommon and, consequently, only one model of multisensory convergence has been offered despite these disparate effects. In this model, converging excitatory afferents from different sensory modalities combine to enhance responses to spatially and temporally coincident multisensory stimuli in a fashion that is clearly linked to detection and orientation behaviors. Yet some multisensory effects do not obey these conventions and it is the central hypothesis of this proposal that there is more than one form of multisensory convergence. Accordingly, during the previous grant period, a 'new' form of multisensory convergence was discovered in somatosensory cortex whereby excitatory afferents from one modality were modulated by inhibitory inputs from another. In fact, a high proportion (approximately 70%) of seemingly 'unimodal' neurons in the fourth somatosensory cortical area (S IV) was suppressed by inputs from the auditory Field of the Anterior Ectosylvian Sulcus (FAES) by GABA-ergic mechanisms. The goal of the present proposal is to expose the fundamental properties of this 'new' form of multisensory convergence by exploring the connectional, functional and developmental mechanisms which underlie it. As more models of convergence become available, understanding the relationship between a particular afferent architecture and the resulting behavioral or perceptual effect will help devise testable hypotheses by which the mechanisms of multisensory processing can be further manipulated and assessed. Ultimately, by understanding the neural bases for multiple forms of cross-modal architecture, we will gain insight into not only non-tactile influences on tactual processing, but also into broad features underlying behavior and perception relevant to both normal and clinical conditions."
6211,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the high prevalence and morbidity, few women suffering from perinatal depression receive mental health treatment, leaving them and their offspring vulnerable to the negative effects. Treatment of perinatal depression presents special challenges since most women will not seek outpatient psychiatry care, choose not to take anti- depressant medications commonly available in medical care settings, prefer psychotherapy, and many have physical, practical, and psychological barriers. There is an urgent need to develop and adapt existing, traditionally delivered evidence-based psychotherapies in order to improve acceptability of and adherence to effective depression treatment. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop a psychotherapeutic intervention tailored to the unique individual-level issues (such as physical mobility, energy and childcare limitations, stigma, and preference for psychosocial treatments) faced by women during the perintal period as identified in obstetrics settings. Specifically, both the treatment delivery method and content of an existing, evidence-based depression treatment (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-CBT) will be adapted based on information learned from our target population as part of this phased project. Three phases of this intervention development proposal will 1) further elucidate and characterize barriers to participation in existing evidenced-based treatment through qualitative analyses of semi-structured interviews, 2) adapt and further develop an existing manualized, evidence based psychotherapy (CBT) based on information learned to be tested in an open pilot, and 3) test and further refine the intervention in a randomized pilot trial (n=60) so that methodological parameters may be estimated and the appropriateness of the intervention for women from different socioeconomic and racial / ethnic backgrounds may be further refined for an optimal test of the intervention in a larger, scientifically rigorous clinical trial. The planned trial designed to test the efficacy of the adapted treatment will proposed in an R01 application. This research seeks to improve the effectiveness of evidence-based psychotherapy by addressing both the treatment content and delivery modality needs of pregnant and post-partum women, and therefore improving depression outcomes for a broader number of depressed, high-need, untreated women. This research aims to improve upon the psychological treatment options for pregnant and post-partum women with untreated depression. Increasing the acceptability and effectiveness of depression treatments for depressed, childbearing women has the potential to prevent behavioral and mental health risk to their children."
6234,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The enrichment and enumeration of exfoliated epithelial cells, from populations of fixed cells immunomagnetically purified from enriched blood samples, has led to the suggestion that these cells are circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) and that the abundance of these cells in peripheral blood samples correlates with the progression of cancer, Cristofanilli et al. (2004). The precise identification and characterization of these exfoliated cells is currently an area of intense investigation, Chen et al. (2005). Two questions are critical in these investigations:     1. Are these exfoliated epithelial cells really CTCs?   2. Is there clinical value in analyzing these CTCs?     A microfluidics-based mammalian cell sorter that is capable of sorting viable, low abundance, mammalian cells from very small cell populations, typically 1,000 to 100,000 cells in 5   30 80% purity with 70-90% recovery. Specifically, the project will first recapitulate the isolation of fixed epithelial cells using a model of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in normal donor blood. Second, the project will isolate viable epithelial cells using the same model. Third, the project will isolate and recover viable primary epithelial cells from 20 ml blood samples obtained from breast cancer patients diagnosed with metastatic disease. Fourth, the viable epithelial cells isolated from patient blood samples will be identified as CTCs using clinically established assays for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2/neu by immunohistochemistry and for HER2/neu by fluorescence in situ hybridization of the isolated cells compared with the identical assays performed on the subject's primary tumor. Alternate approaches will also be available. Using UCSD's Biogem core facility, comparative single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of primary tumor versus isolated exfoliated epithelial cells can be performed as the definitive experiment."
6243,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fertilization depends on the successful interaction of the sperm with the egg. The interactions between the gamete membranes is a fascinating process from a cell biological standpoint, beginning with the sperm contacting and attaching to the egg membrane, progressing to firm cell-cell adhesion, and culminating in membrane fusion. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying gamete membrane interactions is still very incomplete. The overall, long term goal of this project is to understand the mechanism and regulation of cell adhesion between mammalian gametes. Two sperm proteins that participate in mammalian gamete membrane interactions are members the ADAM (A Disintegrin and A Metalloprotease) family of proteins, fertilin alpha (ADAM1) and fertilin beta (ADAM2). Our determination of the key amino acids in fertilin beta that interact with the egg plasma membrane has led to the identification of potential fertilin beta binding partners on eggs. Specific Aim 1 of this proposal will build on this work with investigation of the interactions of candidate integrins with fertilin beta, including studies of eggs deficient in the beta1 integrin subunit. Our studies of fertilin a indicate that this sperm protein can use two different domains to interact with the egg membrane. Following up on this, Specific Aim 2 will determine how these domains of fertilin alpha interact with the egg membrane, including structure-function analysis and identification of binding partners. In addition to this analysis of specific molecular interactions, this project also will examine the mechanism by which sperm-egg adhesion occurs via the coordinated function of these and other gamete molecules. It has become clear that the interaction between the gametes is a complex event, likely to be mediated by multiple molecules on the sperm and egg and to occur in a step-wise fashion. We propose a model for gamete cell adhesion, based on other cell adhesion systems, in which multiple molecules participate and the interactions of gamete adhesion molecules progress to form firm adhesions between the sperm and egg. Specific Aim 3 will test aspects of this model, including studies of the roles of the egg cytoskeleton and the egg membrane protein CD9 in the strengthening of adhesions to sperm ADAMs. Results of these studies will have applications to human reproductive health, with implications for the management of infertility and fertility. This research also will also address fundamental questions in cell adhesion biology by examining this interesting, biologically relevant cell-cell interaction event."
6268,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The training and research described in this K23 application would enable the PI to accomplish two goals: (1) develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator of high-order cognitive impairments and interventions, and (2) through mentored research, identify neuropathological and psychological factors related to the course of recovery from anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP) in stroke. Existing data indicate that following right hemisphere stroke, approximately 30% of patients have AHP, a cognitive impairment in the ability to self-assess and monitor changes in motor abilities. Without insight into their impairments, these patients do not accurately perceive the need for rehabilitation services, which in turn negatively affects their participation and functional outcomes. Current theories of AHP are based on research that has relied on data collected during the subacute to chronic stages of recovery after a variable amount of brain reorganization has already occurred. Additionally, these current theories do not take into consideration the possible role of co-morbid psychological processes that may contribute to the clinical presentation of AHP. This project will test the hypothesis that persistent AHP is related to infarcted tissue in specific brain regions and the presence of co-morbid psychological processes. Specifically, the proposed mentored research will use methodology developed at Johns Hopkins in order to (1) identify AHP in the primary stages of recovery (first 48 hours) from stroke that serves as a clinical marker of dysfunction of hypothesized brain regions as shown on magnetic resonance perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI); (2) demonstrate that primary AHP is related to the volume of hypoperfused and/or infarcted tissue in a circuit that Includes the right precuneus, circulate, thalamus and insula, and that AHP, which persists into the later stages of recovery, is related to the volume of the infarcted tissue in this circuit; and (3) demonstrate that persistent AHP is also related to higher levels of apathy and denial of illness. This project is a first step to mapping out the neural circuitry that underlies AHP, understanding how the neuropathology relates to recovery course, and determining how psychological adjustment factors play a role in prolonging the unawareness presentation. This study will be key in linking the diagnosis with targets for intervention that can lead to adaptive change early in the recovery course and rehabilitation process."
6278,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries, with approximately 39,000 new diagnoses and over 6000 deaths occurring annually in the United States. However, despite the evident risks to women's health, the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of endometrial tumors are poorly understood. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, occurs during normal growth and development and in a variety of diseased states. Aberrant apoptosis is thought to contribute to the pathology, onset and progression of cancer and is associated with resistance to chemotherapy. In the endometrium, alterations in apoptosis have been implicated in both abnormal ovarian/menstrual cycling and endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Increasing apoptotic index correlates with disease progression from atypia to malignancy and high levels of apoptosis are associated with more aggressive, higher-grade tumors with poorer patient prognosis. Endometrial cancers also exhibit alterations in the expression profile or activities of members of the Protein Kinase C (PKC) family, compared to normal tissue and aberrant levels or activation of specific PKC isoforms are postulated to contribute to endometrial neoplasia and transformation. Since PKCs are important regulators of both cell growth and apoptosis in many cell types, we hypothesize that these two characteristic of endometrial tumors are mechanistically linked and that select PKC isoforms differentially regulate apoptosis, survival and proliferation in the endometrium and are critical factors in the formation and progression of endometrial cancers. Adenoviral constructs encoding active or inhibitory PKC isoforms will be used to determine the functional role of specific PKCs in the regulation of apoptosis, growth, migration and invasion in endometrial cancer cells. Changes in PKC expression, localization and/or activity, induced by apoptosis, will be examined and potential upstream regulators or downstream targets of PKC in the apoptotic pathway identified and characterized. Finally, stable cell lines constitutively or inducibly expressing PKC constructs will be used in a mouse xenograft model to elucidate the functional role of PKC isoforms in the growth or regression of endometrial tumors in vivo. Understanding the function and molecular targets of specific PKCs in endometrial cancer will demonstrate their potential as prognostic or diagnostic indicators to identify aggressive, malignant, metastatic tumors and may provide novel strategies for therapeutic intervention."
6296,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a small-molecule fluorescence strategy to selectively label and thereby image discrete protein conformations and assemblies in live cells. We refer to this strategy as bipartite tetracysteine display. It is known that recombinant proteins containing the linear tetracysteine sequence Cys-Cys-Pro-Gly-Cys-Cys are selectively labeled by cell-permeable, pro-fluorescent biarsenical dyes FlAsH and ReAsH. Here we explore (Aim 1.1) whether the linear tetracysteine sequence can be split between two members of a protein partnership, or between two approximated regions of a single protein, while maintaining high biarsenical affinity and brightness, in vitro and in live cells. Next (Aim 1.2) we quantify the loss in FlAsH/ReAsH affinity and brightness when the protein or complex is misfolded or misassembled. Finally, (Aim 1.3) we describe a novel biotin-FlAsH conjugate designed to capture stable protein complexes or well-folded proteins from mixtures of less stable variants in live cells, allowing for the enrichment of phage or mammalian libraries for well-folded proteins or stable protein complexes. In Aim 2 we build on the results of Aim 1 to develop encodable bipartite tetracysteine display-based sensors for (Aim 2.1) tyrosine kinase activity and (Aim 2.2) dynamic [Ca2+] changes that should be brighter than analogous FRET sensors and equipped with the added advantage of temporal control. Later experiments will develop analogous sensors for other kinases, histone methylation and phosphorylation. Finally, (Aim 2.3) we describe bipartite tetracysteine display-based sensors to identify molecules that rescue therapeutically relevant p53 mutants in live cells. Finally in Aim 3 we propose three applications of bipartite tetracysteine display that exploit the unique features of this technique. Aim 3.1 describes complex-edited FALI (CEF), in which FlAsH or ReAsH, upon irradiation, selectively inactivate not single proteins, as reported previously, but distinct protein-protein complexes. Aim 3.2 describes a related technique called complex-edited polymerization (CEB), in which ReAsH selectively polymerizes diaminobenzidine surrounding a distinct protein-protein complex. Finally in Aim 3.3 we design molecules to image and fluorescently differentiate alternative receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) conformational states in the cell membrane. The application describes a small molecule fluorescence approach bipartite tetracysteine display to selectively label, image and/or inactivate discrete protein conformational states and assemblies in live cells. The proposed experiments apply bipartite tetracysteine display to develop brighter encodable sensors for protein kinases and dynamic changes in [Ca2+], for the detection of protein-protein interactions in vivo, and for the high-throughput screening of compounds that stabilize specific protein folds. It may also provide a means to study early protein misfolding events associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and cystic fibrosis."
6308,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drosophila Neuroglian (Nrg), a homolog of vertebrate L1, is a prime example of a multifunctional cell adhesion molecule with a multiplicity of binding partners. Several types of single point mutations at different sites in human L1 have been shown to cause a variety of neurological disorders (CRASH syndrome) including mental retardation, hydrocephalus and spasticity. Nrg/L1 has been shown to be involved in axon pathfinding, neurite extension and cell migration. The role of Nrg/L1 in these developmental processes has been well-characterized in vertebrates and invertebrates but much less is known about potential functions during synapse formation. We have recently shown that Nrg does indeed have an essential function in synaptogenesis. We found that a single missense mutation in the extracellular domain of the nrg849 allele disrupts the assembly and functionality of a central synapse in a well- characterized neuronal circuit, the Giant Fiber System (GFS). Our data suggests that phosphorylation of the intracellular ankyrin binding motif of Nrg/L1 is crucial for giant synapse formation. Interestingly, human L1 is able to completely rescue the phenotype in nrg849 mutants while tested paralogs Neurofascin and NrCAM can not, despite having the same overall domain structure inclusive of the highly conserved ankyrin binding motif. This shows that the GFS is a valid model system for studying L1-specific function. Our preliminary studies indicate that some of the pathological missense mutations identified in L1 affect synapse formation rather than earlier developmental processes. Though a defect in neurite outgrowth, guidance or synapse formation may all result functionally in the same discernable phenotype, a disrupted connection between neurons, the biological process affected is completely different. Our data also suggests that some mutations do not result in a loss of a function phenotype but can also have gain of function and dominant negative consequences as well. Information about the particular biological process being disrupted as well as the protein function being compromised is crucial to find appropriate treatment plans for clinical pathologies associated with different types of mutations in the future. Hence, this grant is designed to further explore Nrg and L1's role in synapse formation as well as to study the effects of identified human mutations in L1 in vivo at a single cell level. We will combine the enormous resource of identified human L1 mutations and the power of genetic and molecular tools in Drosophila to determine which extracellular L1/Nrg interactions and intracellular signaling pathways play a role in synapse formation. We will determine the function of various L1/Nrg constructs in wild type, nrg849 and a temporal loss of function background electrophysiologically and anatomically. The knowledge gained from studies listed in this proposal will enable us to have a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in synaptogenesis as well as the cellular basis of the pathologies underlying L1-related neurological disorders.  More than 170 different mutations in the cell adhesion molecule L1 have been identified to result in a variety of human neurological disorders which are associated with mental retardation, hydrocephalus (enlarged head due to collection of fluid on the brain) and spasticity (involuntary contraction of muscles). We intend to study the effects of these various pathological mutations in vivo at a single cell level in a unique model system, which will allow us to identify the particular biological process being affected, as well as the protein function being disrupted by the mutation. This information is essential to find appropriate treatment for the clinical manifestations of these mutations and hence will benefit the health of patients with L1-related disorders in the future."
6322,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The K23 Candidate is an assistant professor in the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). This K23 application combines mentoring in neurology, pharmacology, and behavioral psychology that relates to adherence of antiepileptic drug therapy (AED) in children with new-onset epilepsy. The proposed career development plan will provide the candidate necessary training in the use of pharmacokinetic modeling of AED serum levels needed to develop an objective biological marker of adherence and training in the development of clinical intervention trials to improve adherence. Training in these areas is needed to develop reliable outcome measures of adherence and implement an evidence-based intervention to improve adherence. The candidate's career plan capitalizes on the expertise at CCHMC to augment prior and planned training in the behavioral aspects of adherence in pediatric epilepsy. In addition, the commitment of the candidate's division related to at least 75 percent protected research time during her early faculty appointment and resources available (e.g., computers, office space) make CCHMC an ideal institution for such an award. The candidate thus proposes a five-year program of intensive mentorship and training by nationally renowned clinical investigators, courses related to pharmacokinetic modeling and therapeutic drug monitoring, longitudinal design and statistical analyses, clinical trials methodology, grant writing skills, and research ethics. The proposed research plan consists of three major aims. The first aim of the study is to validate an objective, biological marker of adherence by measuring the association between the difference (e.g., residual) of PK predicted AED serum concentrations and observed serum concentrations and electronically monitored adherence. The second aim of the study is to identify valid targets for intervention based on a conceptual model that identifies disease/regimen, parent, and child factors associated with poor adherence. Finally, information obtained from Aims 1 (objective marker of adherence) and 2 (targets for intervention) will be utilized to develop, refine, and manualize a behavioral intervention to improve adherence in children with new-onset epilepsy. The combined skill set and experience garnered from the candidate's career development and research plans will provide the necessary early career support for the candidate to establish a successful independent research career in the area of adherence in pediatric epilepsy. Relevance to Public Health: Pediatric epilepsy affects 325,000 children. The candidate's success has significant relevance to public health as the design of effective adherence interventions could improve both health outcomes and quality of life for children with epilepsy and their families."
6335,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasticity of the adult visual cortex plays an important role in normal processes of perceptual learning as well as in functional recovery following central nervous system lesions. We propose in particular that the normal integrative processes seen in visual cortex are recruited for adaptive changes following CNS lesions. To understand the mechanisms underlying adult cortical plasticity, as well as its perceptual consequences, we will work with an experimental model involving the reorganization of cortical topography following binocular retinal lesions. We have made a computational model that relates the normal properties of visual cortical neurons to the changes occurring after retinal lesions, and further relates these changes to perceptual fill-in. In the current study we propose to test the predictions of this model, and to quantify the nature of the functional changes in V1 that ensue following retinal lesions. Monitoring the functional reorganization will be done by electrophysiological recordings in awake behaving monkeys, allowing us to follow the process of reorganization over multiple time points and over large areas of cortex. These experiments are also intended to resolve controversies concerning the prevalence, extent and nature of the remapping of cortical topography in the lesion model. To address issues of mechanism, we will explore the involvement of different components of cortical circuitry in the reorganization. This will be done by in vivo 2-photon imaging of cells, dendrites and axons labeled by neuronal infection with genetically engineered AAV virus carrying genes encoding different fluorophores. We will investigate the relative contribution of long-range horizontal connections, feedback connections from higher order cortical areas, and interlaminar connections within V1, as well as changes in dendritic morphology. With these experiments we hope to learn about the central mechanisms of recovery following retinal degenerations, such as macular degeneration and other forms of CNS damage. Our approach is also designed to further our understanding of the perceptual consequences of the cortical changes induced by retinal damage. Beyond their value in the study of lesion dependent plasticity, these studies will be of relevance to understanding the mechanism of normal experience dependent changes in the visual pathway, such as those associated with perceptual learning. The proposed experiments will help reveal the mechanisms of functional recovery following lesions and degenerative diseases of the CNS, including adult macular degeneration. The studies will also be relevant to understanding the normal experience dependent changes associated with perceptual learning, since the same circuits are likely to be involved."
6350,HHS,HHS,"There is limited knowledge about the mechanisms by which GABA-A receptors are concentrated at inhibitoryGABAergic Gray's type-2 synapses. The GABA-A receptors play a major role in brain function. It has beenestimated that 40% of the brain synapses are GABAergic. The long-term objective of this proposal is toidentify the proteins of the type-2 GABAergic synapses involved in the postsynaptic clustering and anchoringof GABA-A receptors. The aims of this proposal are:1) To demonstrate that GRIP proteins are involved inthe postsynaptic clustering of gephyrin and GABA-A receptors; 2) To study the the relationship between thesynaptic clustering of a protocadherin, whose intracellular domain interacts with the large intracellular loop ofthe gamma 2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, and the synaptic clustering of GABA-A receptors and 3) Totest the hypothesis that septins 6 and 7, which are enriched in type-2 postsynaptic densities in the rat brain,are involved in GABA-A receptor clustering and/or exocytosis. Light microscopy and electron microscopyimmunocytochemistry with specific antibodies will be used for revealing the synaptic co-localization andclustering of GABA-A receptors and synaptic proteins in the intact brain and in hippocampal cultures.Identification of synaptic proteins will be done by mass spectrometry. Techniques such as siRNA treatmentof cultured hippocampal neurons and the expression of tagged postsynaptic proteins in these cultures and inthe intact brain will also be used to elucidate the synaptic targeting and clustering of the synaptic proteinsand GABA-A receptors. These studies are relevant for understanding the molecular components ofGABAergic synapses, their synaptic targeting and postsynaptic clustering as well as the mechanismsinvolved in neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity. It is predicted that the inappropriate synaptic andextrasynaptic localization of GABA-A receptors affects GABAergic synaptic function and brain development,leading to epilepsy and other neurological and mental disorders."
6370,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular regulation of photoreceptor production in the vertebrate retina. This knowledge is imperative to the development of effective stem cell-based photoreceptor replacement therapies. Much needs to be learned about the identities of the genes involved and how they contribute to the selection of the photoreceptor fate from among the other options. Studies during the previous funding period identified neuroD as an instrumental player in photoreceptor differentiation, in a transcriptional pathway of ngn2->neuroD->RaxL. In this pathway, ngn2 functions in multipotent progenitors and its downstream genetic targets include neuroD; neuroD elicits a photoreceptor development program, including the expression of homeobox gene RaxL. In this application we will test the hypothesis that photoreceptor production employs ngn1 at a key step between ngn2 and neuroD. Aim 1 examines whether ngn1 is expressed at the right place and the right time to be a major gene in leading progenitors to the photoreceptor path. Aim 2 investigates whether ngn1 expressly steers progenitors to the photoreceptor path and, thus, leads exclusively to photoreceptor production. Aim 3 determines whether ngn1 is required for photoreceptor production. Aim 4 addresses how ngn1 genetically relates to ngn2 and neuroD during photoreceptor production. These studies will be carried out with a battery of techniques from molecular biology, cell biology, developmental biology, and genetics. This project promises to shed light on the transcriptional regulation governing photoreceptor production. Furthermore, it bears clinical implications. The identification of key genetic players in photoreceptor production will capacitate efficient in vitro or in vivo photoreceptor generation for studies with therapeutic goals. These studies are timely in this era of heightened interest in stem cell research for replacement therapies."
6374,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to provide protected time for Jonathan Williams, M.D. to become a successful independent, patient-oriented research investigator in the field of hormonal mechanisms affecting cardiovascular function in type II diabetes mellitus (DM). Brigham and Women's Hospital and its top-notch General Clinical Research Center will provide an ideal setting in which to peform the studies proposed and a unique opportunity to train a truly interdisciplinary researcher. Critical to obtaining this goal is his ability to acquire three important tools: 1) detailed didactic training in his field of investigation, 2) discipline and organizational expertise and 3) the practical skills necessary to conduct patient-oriented research. To accomplish this, he will participate in advanced didactic courses and conduct a mentored patient-oriented research project under the mentorship of Dr. Paul Conlin. Dr. Williams' proposal expands upon the findings of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) studies, which showed that dietary intake could significantly lower blood pressure. The DASH diet is particularly effective in individuals with hypertension, yet we do not know how the DASH diet works and, beyond its blood pressure lowering effects, we do not know whether the DASH diet might more broadly affect structural and functional abnormalities in the cardiovasculature that frequently accompany patients with DM. Our preliminary data strongly support the possibility that the DASH diet interrupts the renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular tissues. These and other data raise the intriguing possibility that the DASH diet produces effects that mimic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Such effects would offer clear benefits to individuals with the cardiovascular risk factors inherent in DM. In this proposal, Dr. Williams will introduce techniques and skills acquired during his research training to answer the question how the DASH diet affects cardiovascular function in DM. This award will provide the protected time and resources to (1) solidify his didactic training, (2) design, conduct, and complete a patient-oriented research project, and (3) continue to be mentored by leaders in his field of study. It will provide a clear pathway for him to establish an independent patient- oriented research career in cardiovascular endocrinology."
6388,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 	Project Summary: Quintiles Federated Services, Inc. (QFSI), part of the world's largest contract research organization, proposes to create and administer a Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) to conduct studies to support the research objectives of the NIAID HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks. The CTU will participate in three high-priority research areas: translational research/drug development, optimization of clinical management, and vaccine research and development. At full capacity, the CTU will maintain 150 patients/month on study in drug development, 110/month in optimization of clinical management, and 60/month in vaccine development. QFSI will serve as the CTU administrative unit. Community-based HIV care sites in Philadelphia, Washington (DC), northern Virginia, San Francisco, and Los Angeles will be led by highly experienced investigators with a proven track record of enrolling large numbers of patients (including underserved populations) into commercial and community-based clinical trials and obtaining high-quality data. Sites in Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama will provide a unique opportunity to carry out clinical studies in an area that is a leading edge of the HIV pandemic. Investigators and staff at these Central American sites are highly trained and committed to becoming an integral part of NIAID's research program. The local populations will benefit by having access to NIAID-sponsored clinical trials, the clinical research infrastructure in Central America will thrive, and data from such studies stand to advance the clinical science that underpins the optimal care of HIV-infected individuals. Dr. Kathleen Squires, a renowned clinical scientist at Thomas Jefferson University, in Philadelphia, will serve as the co-principal investigator to provide scientific liaison between the CTU and the Network Leadership organizations for matching studies with sites. Relevance: As the global number of individuals living with HIV continues to rise, there is an urgent need to develop potent anti-HIV drugs with novel mechanisms of action, that are active against drug-resistant HIV strains, and that are less toxic and easier to take. There is also an urgent need to better understand how to best use currently available drugs in different stages of disease, in different patient populations, and in treatment-experienced vs. treatment-naive individuals. To help the Clinical Trials Networks address these issues, the Quintiles Federated Services CTU will bring fresh scientific ideas and new patient populations.    ADMINISTRATIVE COMPONENT:"
6406,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurotrophin molecules have been used by numerous investigators to encourage regeneration of damaged spinal axons in models of spinal cord injury. However, these molecules also have short and long term effects on the strength of synaptic connections in the brain. This action is important to understand in the context of encouraging recovery of function using neurotrophins since many neurons and their axons passing through the injury zone survive the contusion which is the most common form of spinal cord injury. Neurotrophins might help strengthen these useful connections, but on the other hand they could strengthen connections responsible for damaging side effects, e.g., pain. We are proposing to continue studies of neurotrophin action on synaptic transmission focusing on determining mechanisms underlying acute (short term) and chronic (long term) effects of neurotrophins on synaptic efficacy. We use the motoneuron and its synaptic inputs as our test system because of the availability of 2 synaptic inputs that can be studied in the same cell. These connections mature at different times, and this has been very helpful in demonstrating in neonatal rats that the acute effects of neurotrophins on AMPA/kainate transmission has a strong dependence on the availability of functional NMDA receptors on the motoneuron associated with that synaptic input. We will determine whether the long lasting chronic effect is simply an extension of the acute effect or involves a different mechanism. We will also extend these studies to adults where NMDA receptors in motoneurons exhibit a substantial decline in function compared to neonates; do neurotrophins still elicit short and long term effects on synaptic transmission in adults? We will determine directly whether NMDA receptors participate directly in the maturation of AMPA/kainate receptor- mediated responses in the motoneuron. Finally, we will follow up on some recent work indicating NMDA receptor mobility in motoneurons of neonates that declines as the rat matures. We are interested in exploring whether NMDA receptor mobility is an important requirement for plasticity of synaptic connections on motoneurons. These studies have application to synaptic transmission, synaptic development and synaptic plasticity. They are expected to contribute to continued efforts to promote recovery from spinal cord injury."
6407,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant is designed to study the mechanisms underlying the effects of polyoma virus' Middle T (MT) antigen and SV40 virus' small t (st) antigen. Recent experiments have greatly increased interest in st. It has been found to play a key role in transforming telomerase-immortalized human epithelial cells in the Weinberg system and in selectively inducing apoptosis in tumor, but not normal, cell lines. Both effects of st are believed to arise from its interaction with a protein phosphatase, PP2A. The experiments in this grant will examine the molecular details by which st selectively inhibits certain isoforms of PP2A by displacing particular B-type subunits. Understanding these details may lead directly to cancer therapy. Similarly the experiments in the grant will study the mechanisms by which MT transforms human epithelial cells. In the last grant period we discovered a new class of mutants in MT that suggests the existence of a new MT binding protein hypothesized to be important in transformation. By using newly developed protocols for isolating all proteins which interact with a target protein, we hope to identify the hypothetical Protein X. Subsequent experiments will test the importance of Protein X in transformation. Once again it is proposed that understanding these mechanisms of MT-mediated transformation may lead to potential therapies for human cancers."
6411,HHS,NSF,"Description (provided by the applicant): Microglia, the immunocompetent cells of the central nervous system, interact with neurons and undertake a number of different functional roles thought to contribute to excitatory neuronal death in acute (e.g., stroke), or chronic (e.g., Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glaucoma) neurodegenerative diseases. We propose to investigate the signaling pathways that lead from neuronal insult to microglial activation in a model of excitotoxic neurodegeneration. We propose to characterize the chemotactic gradients that attract microglia to sites of neuronal injury and define the signaling cascades that result in microglial activation. We will make use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a serine protease produced by neurons and microglia that mediates microglial activation via interaction with a microglial cell surface binding partner, annexin A2. We will also analyze the effector pathways that follow tPA / annexin A2-dependent microglial activation and compromise of the blood-brain-barrier. Finally, we will use animals whose microglia are non functional, as well as mice that express EGFP in their microglia and two-photon microscopy to investigate the role of microglia in normal, non-pathological functions in the CNS.    outstanding proposal that will investigate the signals the determine whether microglia are neuroprotective or neurotoxic following excitotoxicity. The strengths of the proposal include the productivity of the investigator during the previous funding cycle,. The findings of this study could make a significant contribution to the study of microglia and inflammatory cells in general."
6421,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) involves a complex interaction between viral proteins, glial cells (microglia and astrocytes), and mediators (cytokines/chemokines and neurotoxins). A growing body of epidemiological, histopathological, and molecular evidence indicates that substances of abuse, such as, opiates and cocaine, foster development of this devastating brain disorder. However, in contrast to opiates, which have high affinity for mu-opioid receptors, kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) ligands have been shown to have neuroprotective effects. The primary hypothesis underlying the research proposed in this grant application is that KOR ligands have a beneficial influence on HIV-1-related brain disease due to their inhibitory effects on neuropathogenic mechanisms of microglia and astrocytes. Based upon a substantial literature indicating that KOR ligands block responses to cocaine, a secondary hypothesis of this research project is that cocaine has a deleterious influence on HIV-1-related brain disease due to its potentiating effects on neuropathogenic mechanisms of microglia and astrocytes and that KOR ligands will block these effects of cocaine. To test these hypotheses, experiments have been designed using several human cell culture models (and functional assays) that are relevant to HIV-1 neuropathogenesis: microglial cells (expression of HIV-1 and neuropathogenic mediators), astrocytes (chemokine production and glutamate uptake), mixed neuronal/glial cells (apoptosis) and neural progenitor cells (proliferation, differentiation, and migration). In the experiments planned, the effects of selected KOR ligands, some of which have shown promise for treatment of cocaine addiction, will be compared to cocaine, and the inhibitory effects of KOR ligands on cocaine will be assessed. Major emphasis will be placed on defining the mechanisms underlying the effects of KOR ligands and cocaine and mechanisms whereby KOR ligands block the neuropathogenic effects of cocaine. Based upon the results of preliminary studies, the research proposed will yield new insights into these mechanisms and as a result this research project will foster the long-term goal of discovering new interventions for the prevention and treatment of HAD."
6450,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a request for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Award (K23) to develop as an independent clinical trials researcher specializing in the implementation and evaluation of alcohol treatment research with underserved groups. In a prior grant, I found that clinicians responded to minority drinkers with less pity and rated white male drinkers to have less control over their alcohol consumption. Bias, lack of access to treatment, and the language barrier, contribute to health care disparities. These factors explain the accelerated course from drinking to hazardous drinking for Hispanics, who experience a disproportionately higher rate of alcohol problems compared with non-Hispanics. The proposed research study hopes to address these barriers by developing a culturally adapted motivational interview for use by English-speaking clinicians working with Hispanic patients.    Primary research aims of this application are to develop and evaluate a culturally adapted motivational interview (CAMI), and to compare the efficacy of this intervention with standard motivational interview (SMI).  CAMI foci will be on: 1) the integration of cultural norms and attitudes about drinking into the intervention, and 2) methods to deliver the intervention in a culturally sensitive manner. CAMI development will follow stage guidelines. The significance of this research will be to increase understanding on whether integrating cultural factors into an existing psychosocial treatment enhances treatment efficacy, and whether training English-speaking clinicians to deliver an intervention in a culturally sensitive manner enhances clinical process and outcome.    Training goals are to: 1) broaden conceptual knowledge of the factors that influence Hispanic alcohol use in the Northeast, 2) increase expertise in the delivery and evaluation of motivational interviewing, 3) enhance skills in clinical trials methodology and statistics, 4) scholarly productivity, and 5) receive training in research ethics, including ethical issues regarding the conduct of community research. Training goals will be achieved through resources available at 1) the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, Brown University, 2) mentorship, 3) focused coursework and clinical experiences, and 4) the proposed research project."
6489,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Two major medical health care issues are inexorably intertwined: a woman's health, and prenatal development of her unborn child. Maternal folate status is one condition that has a profound influence on development of the central nervous system (CNS), and the incidence and recurrence of certain developmental disorders of the CNS (neural tube defects, NTDs). While NTDs are amongst the most common human malformations, the mechanisms by which folate exerts its ameliorative effect on these malformations, or its role in normal morphogenesis of the CNS, is not well understood. Extant data argue for interactions between folate status and developmental pathways controlled by specific transcriptional regulators. This proposal explores the nature of such interactions and consists of five, hypothesis-driven, specific aims linked together in order to present a cohesive picture of the molecular mechanisms by which specific translational coactivators mediate signal transduction in, and contribute to development of, the developing CNS. The overall hypothesis to be tested by the proposed specific aims is that normal CNS development in the mammalian embryo requires folate-mediated activation of a transcriptional complex, functionally dependent on proper expression and integration of specific transcriptional coactivators. Specifically, we propose that not only is proper expression of Folbp and transcriptional coactivators such as CBP, p300, Cited2, Cart1, and AP-2 requisite for CNS formation, but the integration of these molecules into a functional regulon is critical to normal CNS morphogenesis. Investments in research designed to reveal the causes of congenital anomalies such as NT defects provide excellent opportunities to meet Public Health Service requirements that biomedical science must pay social dividends. Experiments proposed in the current application seek to identify genes, genetic variations and molecular pathways associated with susceptibility to NT defects and to understand signaling mechanisms associated with such disorders.NARRATIVE: In the United States, every three minutes a baby is born with a birth defect! While neural tube defects (NTDs) are amongst the most common human malformations, the mechanisms by which folic acid exerts its ameliorative effect on these malformations, or its role in normal development of the neural tube, is not well understood. Studies proposed in the current application should provide a better understanding of prenatal factors influencing the nutritional/health status of pregnant women, and their impact on the health of the developing fetus, particularly as it relates to NTDs."
6494,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An estimated 160,000 people each year develop melanomas, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, and as many as 48,000 die worldwide every year from some form of skin disease according to the recent World Health Organization (WHO) report. As such, there is a critical need to develop improved diagnostic procedures to reduce these deaths. Because such large numbers of cases are only expected to increase over the next few decades, the object of this application is to develop an improved skin cancer diagnostic system that can have a significant and positive impact on this population, which is the subject of this proposal. The central hypothesis of this application is that single-scattered, polarized light spectroscopic methods combined with multiple-scattered, unpolarized light spectroscopy provide unprecedented tissue functional information and cellular structures for rapid noninvasive diagnosis of the skin cancer. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data produced with our combined Multiple Scattered Light Spectroscopy (MSLS)/Polarized Light Spectroscopy (PLS) prototype laboratory system. The rationale for the proposed research is that a combination of MSLS/PLS technology can be used to accurately reflect morphologies in specific diseased layers of skin. MSLS mathematically models the multilayered structure of the skin using light propagation, whereas PLS physically (not mathematically) discriminates between multiple layers of tissue. This proposed system, achieved highly accurate results for skin cancer detection in a pilot clinical study, providing a specificity of 91%, relative to a specificity of 80% and 82% provided by using PLS and MSLS methods individually. Thus the proposed research is fundamental to the essential part of NIH's mission that pertains to the development new systems to reduce the burden of disease. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing four specific aims. These involve: 1) Developing an optical spectroscopic system combining single/multiple-scattered light measurements; 2) Implementing reconstruction algorithms to improve parameter extractions based on more accurate Hb/HbO2 calculation models, non-spherical particle scattering models and multi-modal particle size distribution models; 3) Testing the system using simulation experiments, and human subjects; 4) Developing algorithms for skin cancer diagnosis by correlating optical signatures with the pathophysiologic parameters using histomorphometric techniques. The approach is innovative because it utilizes the combined single and multiple-scattered light spectroscopic methods for skin cancer diagnosis. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance a novel spectroscopic method for skin cancer detection by focusing on improving feature extraction algorithms and enhancing classification software. This research is expected to significantly contribute to the early skin cancer screening and detection by maximizing cure rates and reducing and avoiding biopsies."
6504,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to develop novel instrumentation for in vivo fluorescence microscopy based on micro-optical probes that are capable of imaging biological cells deep within tissues of live animals or humans in a minimally invasive manner. Capitalizing on recent advances in telecom micro-optics, compound micro-optical probes as small as 350-1000 mu/m in diameter will provide micron-scale resolution of detail. This technology for in vivo micro-imaging will impact several broad classes of applications, including development of novel drugs and therapeutic methods, minimally invasive surgical procedures, and biomedical research on live animal models of disease. Specific aims are to: (1) Develop a second generation of micro-optical instrumentation providing multi-functional capabilities for in vivo imaging in deep tissues previously inaccessible to bulky microscope optics. In particular, we will: Design new micro-optical probes that are smaller, enable higher resolution imaging, and provide broader fields of view than those currently available for micro-optics based microscopy; Equip micro-optical probes with capabilities for fluidic delivery and sampling, enabling in vivo drug delivery to the imaging field and off-line genetic, biochemical, or cytometric analysis of fluid specimens; Equip micro-optical probes with electrodes for making in vivo electrophysiological measurements at the imaging field. Further aims are to: (2) Develop high-speed micro imaging for tracking fast cellular dynamics. Demonstration of this capability in vivo will involve imaging of neuronal Ca 2+ dynamics; (3) Construct a high-speed image stabilization mechanism for keeping micro-optical or conventional microscopy images in focus while tissues are moving in anesthetized or alert subjects. Such capabilities will improve the quality of micro-imaging data and greatly expand the scope of applicability. To validate each new micro-imaging methodology in vivo, we will study neurons, dendrites, and dendritic spines in the hippocampal brain area of live rodents, where in vivo cellular imaging has previously been prohibitive."
6519,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to find the genes underlying Rolandic epilepsy (RE), a developmental focal epilepsy of complex genetic inheritance. RE is the most common epilepsy of childhood and is frequently associated with specific neuropsychological deficits (NPDs), an observation that is not widely appreciated by treating clinicians or by teachers. The NPDs, as well as a subclinical EEG trait, are also found in siblings of RE patients, suggesting RE is caused by a few genes of major effect, a situation for which linkage and association analysis are ideal. We propose to use linkage analysis to identify susceptibility loci for RE and NPDs, and use modern molecular methods and association analysis to pinpoint and identify disease genes at these loci. The three specific aims of the proposal are: (1) to collect detailed clinical, EEG and neuropsychological data and DNA samples from at least 100 families with a typical RE proband. We will use stringent eligibility criteria, and an expert panel to subclassify cases; (2) to perform a genome-wide linkage analysis screen to identify susceptibility loci for RE. We will test, using linkage analysis, the hypotheses that: i) the RE+/-EEG trait and NPDs are manifestations of the same genotype; ii) subtypes of RE, based on diurnal pattern or seizure frequency, represent genetically heterogeneous forms; iii) large, densely affected RE pedigrees have different inheritance from RE found in nuclear families; iv) RE is linked to candidate loci for idiopathic generalized or focal epilepsies; (3) Identify genes and specific mutations at these susceptibility loci that predispose to RE, and that contribute to the expression of clinical, treatment and cognitive outcomes. We will perform precise gene mapping and mutation detection principally using recombination analysis, dense SNP mapping, haplotype reconstruction and DNA sequencing.  Finding RE genes is important because of its high incidence and currently unknown etiology. More importantly, the cause, population incidence, and prognosis of NPDs associated with RE is unknown. We can use genotype-phenotype correlations from our uniquely valuable resource for molecular diagnostic tools to improve patient care and to plan early intervention. Furthermore, genetic discoveries from this research will stimulate discoveries in related severe idiopathic focal childhood epilepsies and neurodevelopmental biology."
6523,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a multi-level study to determine the association between features of the urban environment and sexual and drug use risk factors for HIV infection. Although there are at present several multi-site intervention studies that aim to minimize individual high risk sex and drug-use behavior, surprisingly little systematic research has explored the relation between features of the urban environment, HIV risk behavior, and disease morbidity (sexually transmitted diseases and HIV) while controlling for relevant individual-level covariates. This study will examine the independent and interactive effect of features of the urban social environment (e.g., income distribution, neighborhood disadvantage, racial segregation) and the physical environment (e.g., population density, public transportation, built environment) as they relate to sexual and drug use risk factors for HIV infection and to HIV and STD prevalence. To address the study aims, we will recruit 2,000 persons (including current drug users, past drug users, and never drug users) from twenty-four New York City neighborhoods over a four year period. We will define neighborhoods using cluster analysis, ethnographic mapping, and community consultation. Participants will be recruited using a number of street outreach techniques. Individual risk behaviors and potential mediators and moderators will be assessed through in-person interviews. Features of the urban environment will be assessed from the ethnographic assessments and using publicly available archival information (e.g., New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, Mayor's Management Report). Hierarchical multivariate modeling will be used to determine the relations between features of the urban environment and individual risk behavior, HIV, and STDs. Identification of the key features of the urban environment that shape risk behavior can guide structural interventions, increase the efficiency of individual-level behavioral interventions, and identify features of urban neighborhoods that could suggest population vulnerability to rapid transmission of HIV."
6526,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop efficient group II intron-based gene targeting methods for Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis. Mobile group II introns insert site-specifically into DNA target sites by a remarkable mechanism in which the intron RNA reverse splices directly into one DNA strand, while the associated intron-encoded protein cleaves the opposite strand and uses the cleaved 3' end as a primer for reverse transcription of the inserted intron RNA. This mechanism is mediated by an RNP complex that contains the intron-encoded protein and the excised intron RNA and uses both for DNA target site recognition, with most of the specificity coming from base pairing of the intron RNA to the target sequence. This feature combined with their very high insertion frequencies and specificity have made it possible to develop mobile group II introns into highly efficient bacterial gene targeting vectors ( targetrons ), which can be reprogrammed to insert into desired DNA target sites simply by modifying the intron RNA. The objective of the proposed research is to develop analogous group II intron-based gene targeting methods for Xenopus. Specific aims are: (1) To develop methods for gene targeting via injection of group II intron RNPs into Xenopus laevis oocytes and/or eggs. (2) To develop methods for group II intron-gene targeting in decondensed Xenopus laevis sperm nuclei by modifcation of commonly used Xenopus transgenesis protocols. (3) To develop methods for gene targeting in Xenopus laevis by expressing group II intron RNPs from injected DNA and/or RNA constructs. (4) To extend the methods developed in Aims 1-3 to Xenopus tropicalis and to use group II introns to generate gene knockout and GFP-fusion knock-in animal lines in Xenopus tropicalis. We anticipate that this project will provide important new technologies for genetic studies of developmental and cell biology in Xenopus. It will also be a major step toward our ultimate goal of generalizable group II intron- based gene targeting systems for eukaryotes, with potentially broad applications in genetic engineering, functional genomics, and gene therapy."
6527,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Focal neuropathies of the hand are among the most common diseases treated by neurologists. The two most common are median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) and ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. The current electrophysiological methods of assessment of focal neuropathies can be painful, and include nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a new technique that can be used to assess neuromuscular disease. We have had success in using EIM in small muscles in animals, and limited experience using EIM in small muscles in human studies. We plan to refine these techniques in this proposal, while studying focal neuropathies of the hand. The long-term goal of this proposal is to make EIM a valuable tool for the assessment of neuromuscular disease. Establishing standards for use in small muscles will complement the known utility of EIM in larger muscles and help make it such a tool. We have three specific aims for this study. First, we aim to establish a range of normality for EIM for the three hand muscles that are tested most commonly in standard neurophysiologic assessment: the abductor digiti minimi, first dorsal interosseous, and abductor pollicis brevis. Second, we will evaluate EIM parameters in a group of patients with median or ulnar neuropathy, predicting that EIM parameters recorded from affected muscles in patients with median and ulnar neuropathy will differ from normal subjects due to the underlying architectural alterations in the muscle caused by neurogenic injury. Third, in order to determine the ability of EIM to judge lesion severity, we seek to determine the correlation between EIM parameters with standard electromyography (EMG) parameters in patients with focal neuropathy. Relevance to public health: Focal neuropathies of the hand, which include median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) and ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, occur in approximately 10% of people. The standard neurophysiologic assessment of these problems includes electromyography and nerve conduction studies, both of which may be poorly tolerated. We are developing electrical impedance myography as a painless, noninvasive, quantifiable technique to assess focal neuropathies of the hand, and neuromuscular diseases in general."
6528,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is recognized that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in breast cancer. The genetic component has been verified by the discovery of the high-penetrance genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Hormonal factors, radiation, diet, oral contraceptive use and estrogen replacement therapy are among some of environmental factors believed to influence breast cancer risk. Population genetic theory predicts that a large proportion of the prevalence of complex diseases will be due to genetic variation and environmental risk factors that are common in the population. Low penetrance genetic variants may not have a large influence on individual risk, however when common in the population, will be a large component of the overall attributable risk for the disease. Until recently, the interaction between environmental risk factors and genes in determining breast cancer risk has not been explored. We are now at a point where we can use the existing resource of population-based breast cancer families to characterize common genetic variants in a series of candidate breast cancer modifier genes and study the relationship between this variation, environmental risk factors and breast cancer risk. This innovative approach uses our fully characterized resource. The Specific Aims of this new phase are as follows: 1) We will, in an initial discovery phase, identify common sequence variants in a panel of candidate genes selected because of their potential function in a specific pathway known to be associated with increased risk of breast cancer or physiological changes associated with a known risk factor for breast cancer; 2) To study the relationship between a series of candidate genes and breast cancer risk; 3) To study the effects on breast cancer risk due to the environmental risk factors and the interaction between the candidate genes and environmental risk factors; 4) To validate and fine map any genetic factors which are found to influence breast cancer risk in the analyses described in Specific Aims 2 and 3."

In keeping with the RFA, the PD-DOC will: 1) establish, maintain and disseminate a shared, central and standardized longitudinal database in support of the prospective collection and analysis of clinical, neuropathological and biologic data from patients with PD and controls, 2) assess and move toward the potential integration of relevant pre-existing databases, 3) assist investigators planning to perform research studies using the shared database, 4) prepare and maintain an up-to-date catalog of research materials at participating sites that might be used for PD research and, 5) coordinate annual meetings of the PD-DOC Steering Committee. The University of Rochester has extensive expertise and  resources which will facilitate the development of a highly successful PD-DOC. The PD-DOC will be a critical force in advancing collaborative research in PD."
6554,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Extracts of milk thistle (Silybum marianum) have been used since antiquity for a number of disorders and have most recently been investigated for utility in hepatic disorders of viral and chemical origin, dyslipidemia, and cancer. Milk thistle extracts, often referred to interchangably as silymarin or silibinin, contain a number of flavonoid and flavonolignan compounds that are responsible for their in vitro and in vivo biological effects. However, studies to ascribe particular biological actions to specific milk thistle components have been few in number due both to the complex stereochemistry of the naturally-occurring compounds and the considerable challenges in isolating these compounds in sufficient quantities. The RTI Natural Products Laboratory has recently succeeded in identifying and isolating from commercially-available silymarin the individual stereoand regio-isomers of milk thistle flavonolignans. These compounds, referred to as silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A, and isosilybin B, are now available for the first time for characterization of their individual biological activities and, specifically, the determination of their relative contribution to the substantial activity of silibinin and silymarin observed previously in pre-clinical models of human prostate cancer. To do so, the group has established a collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Rajesh Agarwal at the University of Colorado, the international leader in the demonstrating the efficacy of milk thistle extracts in skin and prostate cancer models and the biochemical mechanisms underlying these responses. This collaborative research group proposes to test the HYPOTHESIS that individual flavonolignan isomers possess distinct biological activities that account for the collective anti-cancer action previously observed for the naturally occurring milk thistle extract mixtures, silibinin and silymarin. Specifically, the group proposes 1) to conduct and optimize the semi-synthesis of the 4 milk thistle flavonolignans in order to isolate each in the larger quantities required for all in vitro and in vivo studies, 2) to investigate the antitumor activity of each individual flavonolignan relative to silibinin and silymarin in DU145 hormone-refractory, metastatic human prostate cancer in immunocompromised mice, 3) to determine the specific biological actions of each flavonolignan on in vitro endpoints of mitogenic cellular signaling and cell cycle progression, and 4) to determine the specific biological actions of each flavonolignan on a) genetic elements in the IGFBP-3 and topoisomerase II gene promoters and b) newly described causative/prognostic factors in human prostate cancer (CXCR4, EZH2, and AMACR). Taken together, these studies are anticipated to advance our biochemical understanding of a highly non-toxic prostate cancer prevention and treatment intervention with the possibility of identifying more efficacious and/or bioavailable combinations of compounds than those occurring naturally."
6555,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     We aim to utilize the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966) to identify sequence variants associated with quantitative traits that are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome. The NFBC is drawn from a population that combines a significant founder effect and subsequent isolation with a Western life style and comprehensive health care system with excellent registers. This cohort is ideally suited for investigating a) genetic risk factors underlying a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, and b) the relationship between DMA variants and well defined environmental and life style variables. In particular, this longitudinal study has prospectively collected details of early life events, thought to be critical risk factors for many cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesize that allelic variations in several genes are responsible for the genetic component of the variance for several quantitative traits relevant to cardiovascular disease. Some of these variants are likely to be responsible predominantly for threshold effects, while others are likely to have a truly quantitative effect on the trait. We further hypothesize that it is highly advantageous to search for these variants in a setting with a restricted number of ancestral disease alleles, as are expected to be found in study samples in NFBC. While the current proposal focuses on a small number of well characterized phenotypes, once the genotypes have been obtained, it will be possible to use the wealth of phenotypic data available to conduct similar analyses for a large number of other traits related to heart, lung and blood disorders. Specifically we aim: 1) To conduct a whole genome association (WGA) study for quantitative traits relevant to cardiovascular risk in 2000 individuals from NFBC1966, 2) To perform statistical analyses to investigate the relationships between gene variants and between genetic variants and lifestyle/ environmental risk factors, focusing particularly on early life events. 3) To use the remainder of NFBC1966 (about 3900 individuals) for extension and finer-scale association analyses of significant association signals identified in aims 1 and 2.

6595,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research is to determine the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of the human MnSOD gene during tumor promotion. It is well documented that MnSOD level is altered in transformed cells. Our previous studies demonstrate that overexpression of the MnSOD gene suppresses tumorigenesis in a multistage skin cancer model. However, when and how MnSOD expression is modulated during carcinogenesis is unknown. We have generated several lines of transgenic mice expressing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of MnSOD promoter/enhancer elements. This unique animal model provides an outstanding opportunity for investigating changes in MnSOD expression during the carcinogenesis process in animals by a non-invasive method. We hypothesize that repetitive exposure to tumor promoter leads to inactivation of MnSOD expression. Specific Aim 1 will determine at what point the expression of MnSOD is reduced during the process of cancer development using transgenic mice harboring a MnSOD promoter-driven luciferase reporter and bioluminescence-imaging strategies to noninvasively and quantitatively image MnSOD expression in living mice. Specific Aim 2 will investigate how changes in MnSOD expression occur in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, DNA sequencing, and proteomic analyses. Specific Aim 3 will identify transcription factors and co-activators/repressors necessary for transcriptional modulation of the MnSOD gene using DNA binding, siRNA, and protein/protein interaction methods. The results of the proposed studies will provide information on when and how the expression of MnSOD is altered during tumorigenesis. Because of the essential role of MnSOD for the survival of aerobic life and its well documented role in the prevention of oxidative stress-mediated tissue injury and cancer formation, understanding how the expression of MnSOD can be regulated during cancer development is likely to have broad implications for the prevention of cancer."
6618,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative agent of human hepatitis E, is an important public health problem in many developing countries, and is also endemic in the United States and other industrialized countries. The mortality rate is reportedly up to 30% in infected pregnant women. Due to the lack of a practical animal model and a sufficient in vitro cell culture system, the mechanisms of HEV replication and pathogenesis are poorly understood and a vaccine for HEV is still not available. Supported by a 4-year R01 award, we have generated enormous amounts of important data including the construction of an infectious cDNA clone of an avian strain of HEV and establishment of a unique small homologous chicken model for HEV. Since we have completed all proposed work and since this 4-year R01 ended on June 14, 2006 (currently on a 1- year no-cost extension), we thus submit this twice-amended (A2) competing renewal to continue our long-term objectives on this important but extremely understudied human pathogen. The central hypothesis is that avian HEV and chickens is a useful model system to delineate the mechanisms of HEV replication and pathogenesis. The long-term objectives are to define the mechanisms of HEV replication and pathogenesis by using avian HEV and chickens as a model system and by using avian HEV infectious cDNA clone to identify HEV genes and genetic determinants that are functionally important for these processes. There are 3 specific aims in this twice-amended competing renewal: (1).Comparative pathogenesis between an apparently non- pathogenic strain of avian HEV and the pathogenic avian HEV strain in laying hens of 30 weeks of age; (2).Identification of genetic determinants for HEV attenuation by using avian HEV infectious cDNA clone and chickens as a model; and (3).Understanding the roles of the small ORF3 protein in HEV replication and/or pathogenesis. This will be accomplished by using standard techniques including animal experiments, cell cultures, PCR, cloning and sequencing, mutagenesis, molecular biology, biochemical, virological, serological and pathological methods. Continuing support of this project will enable us to fully utilize the precious reagents and tools generated from the past funding period to launch more in-depth studies on the structural and functional relationship of HEV genes using a unique small homologous animal model. The data from this study will help design effective preventive and control measures against this important human pathogen.     The lack of knowledge on HEV basic biology and pathogenesis has greatly hindered the development of a vaccine against HEV. The information gained from this project will help understand the mechanisms of HEV replication and pathogenesis, and help devise effective preventive and control strategies against this important but extremely understudied human pathogen."
6627,HHS,NSF,"The long-term goal of this research is to understand the architecture and behavior of motor units in differenthuman muscles. The motor unit is the basic functional unit of the neuromuscular system. The way in whichmuscle fibers are organized into motor units and the way in which motor units are coordinated are importantdeterminants of a muscle's ability to produce force and movement. The only method currently available forstudying individual motor units in intact humans involves analyzing electromyographic (EMG) signals.Decomposition of multi-unit EMG signals allows identification of individual motor-unit discharge patterns andaction-potential waveforms. Further analysis of the action-potential waveforms provides information aboutmotor-unit architecture, including the locations of motor endplates and muscle/tendon junctions. EMGdecomposition in general, and motor-unit architecture analysis in particular, are not utilized as widely as theycould be, in large part because of the lack of available software and because of concerns about the validityof decomposition. We propose to establish a firm scientific foundation for the validity of EMG decompositionby developing a rigorous and objective method for quantifying the accuracy of decomposition results. Thiswill be based on cross-checking results obtained from multi- or single-unit electrodes located at nearby sitesin the same muscle. We further propose to enhance and disseminate a powerful, versatile, and accurateEMG decomposition program that we have developed over the past 20 years. All results will be madeavailable via an internet site that will serve as a forum for the exchange of software, test signals, andinformation related to EMG decomposition. The proposed work will benefit the scientific community bymaking a powerful research tool more trustworthy and more widely available. This tool will be useful forstudying the basic structure and function of human muscles, and it will be relevant to several clinicalapplications, including tendon-transfer and reconstructive surgery, rehabilitation in stroke and cerebral palsy,and clinical electromyography."
6630,HHS,HHS,"The locomotory system of nematodes is the target of many currently used anthelminthics, sincedisruption of locomotory behavior interferes with the normal processes by which many nematodes maintaintheir position within the host. The problem of genetic drug resistance is making many of the available drugsless effective, so it is important to develop new generations of anti-nematdde drugs. The proposed researchaims to describe new intercellular signaling systems that are important in the motornervous system thatcontrols locomotion. Our strategy is based on our previous work in which we isolated and sequenced a largefamily of 29 novel endogenous neuropeptides in the parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum. Preliminaryexperiments have shown that almost all of the peptides tested have potent activity .on the neuromuscularsystem of Ascaris. Some cause paralysis, others exaggerate locomotory movements. Neuropeptides,therefore, play an important role in the overall activity of the motornervous system. There is every indicationthat there are many more peptides than the ones we have isolated so far. There is no indication that thecurrently available peptides are the most potent, so we propose to isolate new peptides, concentrating onthose that are present in the motornervous system, in order to detect new peptides that have potentphysiological activity. This is basic research upon which new generations of anthelminthics can ultimately bedeveloped."
6648,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate psychometric properties of neuropsychological instruments in which standardized procedures have been modified to bypass oral speech and motoric response demands. Commonly used tests of cognition including neuropsychological and psychoeducational instruments are not accessible to children with significant motoric or communicative impairments, despite the high risk for mental retardation and need for special education support in this population. One consequence is that relatively little is known about the specific neuropsychological profiles and educational needs of children with conditions such as cerebral palsy (CP), the leading cause of childhood disability. The relatively small number of neuropsychological studies of children with CP typically exclude participants with significant motoric and communicative impairments. The lack of information about the academic potential of many of these children is a burden to families and a source of conflict between families and schools. Technological advances in augmentative communication and rehabilitation engineering can be used to adapt presentation and response formats of assessment instruments, thus providing targeted diagnostic testing and more refined educational planning for these children. Specific aims of this research are: 1. To examine psychometric properties including reliability and concurrent validity of newly developed adapted neuropsychological tests 2. To examine the predictive validity of adapted instruments by examining the associations between phonemic awareness and reading level; 3. To compare the neuropsychological profiles within and between groups using the standardized and adapted versions of instruments. To accomplish these aims, 60 children with CP and 60 typically developing children will be administered standardized and/or adapted versions of common neuropsychologjcal instruments. Children diagnosed with CP will be in one of two subgroups representing different levels of impairment: 1. Oral communicators with functional activity levels of GMFCS l-lll; 2. Nonverbal limited communicators (able to provide a reliable yes/no non-verbal response) and classified as GMFCS Levels IV and V. Cognitive measures will be administered using adaptive techniques such as computerized presentations of stimuli, forced choice response options, and other modifications. All children, with the exception of those classified as Level IV or V, will complete both standardized and adapted measures. Children classified as GMFCS IV-V will complete adapted versions only as standardized instruments require spoken or discrete fine motor responses. We will use multiple analysis of variance to describe differences in neuropsychological profiles not only between CP and TD groups, but also between CP subgroups. Bivariate correlations will be used to measure validity and reliability of adaptive measures. Logistic regression analyses will be used to identify cognitive factors most predictive of reading skills in children with CP. The results are expected to provide preliminary data for a larger, multi-site study of neuropsychological risks and needs associated with CP and provide data to inform not only an understanding of how children diagnosed with CP develop reading skills, but also specific interventions to maximize academic potential."
6686,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Leptin is a peptide hormone produced by adipose tissue and released in proportion to adipose mass. Leptin acts on the central nervous system to increase lipolysis and heat production through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. It is also a potent inhibitor of feeding behavior. A great deal is known about how leptin can invoke changes in transcription, resulting in the enhancement or suppression of the synthesis of peptide neurotransmitters that regulate feeding or metabolism. However, the mechanism by which leptin generates rapid changes in the excitability of neural pathways regulating autonomic and behavioral functions is less certain. A confounding factor in understanding rapid leptin signaling may be the high degree of cooperativity that exists between leptin transduction mechanisms and those of other agonists. This relationship may cause leptin action to be  gated  by parallel signals or, vice versa, leptin may  gate  the effectiveness of other agonists involved in autonomic or behavioral control. A synergistic relationship between leptin and other factors operating simultaneously may offer an intriguing explanation for the effects of temperature on the effectiveness of leptin and the effect of leptin to sensitize thermoregulatory mechanisms. The dorsal vagal complex [DVC] has receptor elements for leptin and receives thyrotropin releasing hormone [TRH]-ergic input from pathways known to command sympathetically-mediated increases in heat production. We propose that leptin and TRH action on DVC neurons is highly cooperative to the point that the presence of one agonist essentially  gates  the action of the other. Our preliminary results show that leptin applied alone to the dorsal medulla has no consistent effects on brown adipose tissue [BAT] temperature. TRH produces a small increase in BAT temperature. However, TRH and leptin applied to the dorsal medulla together produce an increase in BAT and core temperature 300 percent greater than leptin or TRH alone. This effect can be elicited in the acute decerebrate rat, suggesting that the effect is mediated entirely by the brainstem. Obesity is the consequence of a failure to balance feeding behavior with metabolic activity and has reached epidemic levels of incidence in virtually every modern society. Obesity exacerbates, or is a frank causative factor, in a number of chronic diseases. The accumulated financial burden associated with the effect of obesity to worsen the health of the population is over $240 billion per year. Unfortunately, evidence suggests that the incidence of obesity will increase over time. Clearly, a better understanding of the control of energy expenditure should be crucial to the control of obesity and is of critical scientific, clinical and societal importance."
6692,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this application is for the candidate to become an independent investigator studying promising new neuroprotective botanical treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) in human subjects using advanced MRI imaging measures. Axonal loss is thought to be the cause of irreversible progression of disability in MS. None of the available therapies for MS directly protect axons. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a potent antioxidant and is the main component contained in polyphenon E, an extract from the leaves of the green tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Animal studies done by our group indicate that EGCG protects axons in the spinal cord from injury in an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalitis. The overall objective of this application is to determine if polyphenon E is a safe neuroprotective therapy that warrants further study as a treatment to prevent the progression of disability in  MS. To achieve this objective, a double-blind, controlled, two-arm parallel group clinical trial will be  conducted; 46 subjects with MS will be treated for two years with either polyphenon E 400 mg twice a day or placebo. The first specific objective is to determine if there is evidence of a neuroprotective effect. To accomplish this objective the difference between the two groups on the rate of change in n-acetyl aspartate (NAA) will be determined. NAA was selected as the primary outcome because it is a selective marker for neurons and axons that reflects their number and metabolic activity and thus is optimal to show a neuroprotective effect. NAA levels will be measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline, six months, a year and two years. Changes in magnetization transfer ratio and brain atrophy will be secondary outcomes. The second specific objective is to determine the safety of polyphenon E in subjects with MS. The subjects will be monitored for adverse events with laboratory exams and physical exams. The third specific objective is to determine if plasma levels of EGCG predict changes in the imaging markers or the occurrence of adverse events. Conducting this study will allow the candidate to obtain extensive training advanced magnetic resonance techniques and pharmacokinetics. Relevance to public health: MS is the second most common cause of neurological disability among young people. This study is relevant to public health because it is expected to result in a new treatment for MS that can prevent the progression of disability."
6702,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stroke represents a major public health problem in the US, affecting nearly 700,000 individuals annually. Among the different types of stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), most commonly due to intracranial aneurysm (IA), carries the highest mortality rate. Lifetime prevalence estimates of IA range from 0.2%-9.9% (mean 5.5%). Despite this common prevalence, little is known regarding the pathophysiology of IA. While environmental factors are thought to play a role, there is also considerable support for a genetic contribution. In order to dissect the molecular genetics of IA and to clone disease causing transcripts, we have taken an outlier approach and searched nationally and internationally for extended IA kindreds. Over the past 10 years, we have screened over 3200 IA patients and identified 168 IA families, with a total of more than 450 affected individuals. Since the original submission, we have obtained additional samples from 18 Utah kindreds and identified over 250 independent Finnish IA index cases. We are now in the process of collecting these samples. Critically, eight of the already families are sufficiently large to support genome-wide significance independently. We have now completed genome-wide linkage analysis on four of these families (IAs 20, 100, 101 and 112) and have identified IA loci on chromosomes 1p, 6p, 11 q and 14q with lod scores > 3. Importantly, the 11q and 14q loci have been shown likely to contain IA genes in previous sib pair linkage studies. In addition, we have identified multiple additional families that show suggestive linkages to each of these regions. Since the original application, we have also completed the first stage of genome wide linkage analysis of 5 extended Utah kindreds showing that two of them share a conserved haplotype linking and significantly narrowing the 11q locus. We are now confirming these preliminary results in our second stage analysis using STS markers. Our preliminary analysis of the remaining 3 extended Utah kindreds further confirm the presence of additional IA susceptibility loci throughout the genome.We propose to use this unique set of IA kindreds to fine map these loci and perform mutational analysis of coding and non-coding regions of candidate genes located within these intervals by using all families that link to a particular locus in order to identify IA disease genes. Once specific transcripts are cloned, we will be able to examine the pathophysiology of IA, which ultimately may lead to novel therapeutic approaches."
6705,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have developed genetically engineered herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) vectors that can selectively and efficiently infect and kill brain tumor cells in situ without harming surrounding brain cells and without causing systemic disease. Having taken one such vector into human clinical trial, we are currently planning a second trial based on our recently published data demonstrating that cancer cell DNA repair pathways can be used in conjunction with specific HSV gene mutations and chemotherapeutics to increase the efficacy of herpes oncolytic viral therapy for brain tumor therapy. The current grant proposal both builds upon the findings of the past grant period as well as explores other cancer cell mechanisms that also may be utilized in conjunction with appropriate Pharmaceuticals to improve oncolytic viral efficacy. In order to increase the efficacy of HSV oncolysis in brain tumor therapy, we hypothesize that: 1: HSV vectors directly expressing GADD34 or indirectly inducing GADD34 expression will have increased efficacy in tumor cells. We will create vectors expressing GADD34 as well as vectors containing transgenes that may act as regulators of GADD34. 2: The efficacy of oncolytic HSV therapy can be increased by combination with chemotherapeutic drugs inhibiting topoisomerases or microtubules. Both of these classes of drugs interact with the virus and the tumor cells and may be avenues for novel therapeutic synergy. 3. Targeting the tumor vasculature using  armed  anti-angiogenic oncolytic HSV vectors in conjunction with appropriate Pharmaceuticals will further improve therapeutic efficacy. We have demonstrated that a combined attack on both the tumor cells and the tumor vasculature can increase anti-tumor efficacy. We have already created several HSV vectors expressing anti-angiogenic genes. We have also developed a rapid method for vector creation to allow for the testing of additional anti-angiogenic genes. Additional  armed  vectors will be created and we will test their efficacy in vitro and animal brain tumor models. Additionally, we will investigate the interactions of HSV with anti-angiogenic Pharmaceuticals with our vectors. Upon completion of this proposal, we anticipate that one or more of these strategies will be in a position to be translated into a clinical trial for the therapy of malignant glioma."

The long- term objective of this Career Development Award proposal is consistent with the NCI Challenge Goal in two ways: 1) providing the necessary training for the candidate to become an independent cancer prevention and control researcher specializing in the effects of radiotherapy on patients' quality of life; and 2) to develop and test a cognitive-behavioral intervention to combat the effects of acute skin toxicity on breast cancer radiotherapy patients' quality of life (QOL). Specific Aims: 1) To use qualitative research methods to thoroughly assess and document the effects of radiotherapy-induced skin toxicity on quality of life of breast cancer radiotherapy patients. 2) To investigate the impact of a behavioral medicine intervention, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis (CBT+H), informed by the results of Aim 1, on the effects of skin toxicity in breast cancer radiotherapy patients. 3) To explore the role of social and psychological factors in the mediation and moderation of the beneficial impact of the CBT+Hypnosis intervention. Key mediators and moderators include: social factors (working alliance, interpersonal complementarity), psychological factors (distress, response expectancies) and hypnotizability. Research Design and Methods: Aim 1: Breast cancer radiotherapy patients (N=20) will participate in individual qualitative interviews and focus groups to learn how skin toxicity has affected their QOL. Thematic and discursive analytic approaches will be used. Aims 2 and 3 will be carried out using RCT methodology to compare a cognitive-behavioral intervention with hypnosis (CBT+H) to attention control (AC) with regard to improvements in skin toxicity-related QOL. 144 breast cancer radiotherapy patients will be randomly assigned to group, and assessments will be administered during, and for one month following, radiotherapy. Public Health Relevance: First, the award will produce a highly qualified cancer prevention and control researcher with a focus on radiotherapy. Second, the proposal will test a new intervention with the potential to improve the quality of life of all breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, an often ignored group from the behavioral medicine perspective."
6731,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA ligases catalyze the final common step of DNA repair and replication by restoring the integrity of the DNA phosphodiester backbone. All known bacterial genomes encode an NAD dependent DNA ligase (LigA) which is essential for viability. Some bacterial genomes encode an additional ATP dependent ligase of unknown function. Mycobacteria, including the major human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtu) and the genetically tractable M. smegmatis (MSm), encode 3 putative ATP dependent DNA ligases (LigB, LigC, LigD) in addition to LigA. The function of these ATP dependent ligases in mycobacterial DNA repair systems and mycobacterial pathogenesis is unknown. Our preliminary data shows that these 3 ligases are ATP dependent ligases in vitro, but with distinct catalytic properties. Null mutants of each ligase in MSm and Mtu indicate that these ligases are nonessential for growth individually and in combination but that three alternative ATP dependent ligases does not rescue the essentiality of LigA in M. smegmatis. In addition both ligC and ligD participate in a novel pathway of prokaryotic Non homologous end joining (NHEJ) which is efficient but low fidelity. Sequence analysis of NHEJ junctions indicates involvement of polymerase and nuclease activities in blunt end mycobacterial NHEJ. The purpose of the experiments proposed herein is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms, physiologic role, and pathogenetic importance of Non homologous end joining (NHEJ) mediated by ATP dependent DNA ligases in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. We propose a multidisciplinary research program encompassing genetics, biochemistry and microbial pathogenesis that will address the hypothesis that the DNA ligases of mycobacteria are a novel DNA repair system that defends the mycobacterial chromosome against double strand breaks during in vivo growth and persistence."
6747,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is the only member of the SRC (steroid receptor coactivator) family amplified and overexpressed in many epithelial tumors. AIB1 is rate-limiting for estrogen (E) dependent tumor development but emerging data ascribes an E-independent role for AIB1 whereby AIB1 is rate-limiting for IGF-1, EGF and heregulin-induced transcription & phenotypic changes important for tumor progression. The mechanism(s) of AIB1's potentiation of growth factor signaling is completely unknown. We now report that a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of AIB1 occurs within minutes of growth factor treatment, paralleled by nuclear translocation and rapid association of AIB1 with cytoplasmic signaling molecule(s), e.g. IRS-1. We hypothesize that tyrosine phosphorylation of AIB1 promotes interactions with critical signaling molecules that initiate nuclear translocation and transcriptional coactivator activity. Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms and the function of tyrosine phosphorylation of AIB1 due to IGF-1, EGF and Heregulin stimulation of cells.  A) We will identify the tyrosine residues phosphorylated in AIB1 after IGF, EGF or Heregulin treatment. B) We will determine the role of these tyrosine residues in AIB1 for: (i) translocation of AIB1 to the nucleus and (ii) transcriptional activity of AIB1. C) We will determine the upstream pathways leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of AIB1 due to IGF-1, EGF and Heregulin stimulation. Aim 2: To determine the role of AIB1 in growth factor mediated mammary tumorigenesis.  A) We will determine whether gain or loss of AIB1 or AIB1-?3 alters preneoplasia, onset, incidence, metastatic spread and gene expression pattern of mammary adenocarcinoma in MMTV/neuT mice. B) We will determine if AIB1 directly affects IGF-1, EGF or Heregulin pathways by examining signaling in mammary organ culture derived from MMTV/neuT mice with gain or loss of AIB1 or AIB1-??"
6758,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the field of nanotechnology, much attention has been paid to the construction of nanometer- sized particles that can harbor drugs and other therapeutic agents. However, beyond the use of static ligands such as antibodies and small peptides, little work has been done on the specific targeting of the nanoparticles (NPs). This is an important component of NP design. By selectively delivering drugs to one cell over another, the efficacy of the drug can be drastically improved and consequently reduce the dosage needed and potential side effects. Viruses share many structural and physical similarities to an idealized NP. They are both about 100 nm in diameter, have hydrophilic shells and have long circulatory lives. However, viruses achieve a feat that few NP designs can; they efficiently target specific tissues and cells using virus envelope proteins (envs). The envs also do something that designed ligands may never achieve; they target specific cellular endocytic pathways, to access organelles such as the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum. Envs are also simple membrane fusion engines that sense the surrounding environment to trigger the release of their cargo in the cell cytoplasm at specific sites. In this proposal, we will optimize techniques to construct fluorescent NPs coated in the envs of Friend murine leukemia virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (NIH category B agent) and Ebola (NIH category An agent). Each env targets virus to unique cell receptors and endocytic entry pathways. We will investigate the cell and organelle targeting properties of the coated envs using state-of-the-art confocal microscopy and biochemical methods. Together with a novel way to target NPs, this work will allow a better understanding of the role of envs in infection and the entry pathways used by each virus. This will identify new targets for antiviral drug development. The NPs will also be useful in rapid virus diagnostic assays.     Project Narrative:  Highly purified virus membranes will be used to coat nanoparticles using a new method that preserves the useful features of the virus envelope proteins. The nanoparticles will then be tested for their ability to specifically interact with and enter cells. This will greatly aid in the development of targeted drug therapies and vaccine design."
6767,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. In 2001 there were 2 million CHD hospitalizations with an annual cost of $133 billion. Current strategies for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes, which includes restoring epicardial coronary artery patency, do not consistently restore microvascular perfusion, which has adverse clinical consequences. Drag-reducing polymers (DRPs) may fill this void. DRPs reduce vascular resistance, potentially by targeting the rheology and hydrodynamics of blood flow. Under AHA support, the Principal Investigator has studied the effects of DRPs on myocardial perfusion in the setting of graded canine coronary stenoses. He has found that minute intravascular concentrations of DRPs normalize myocardial perfusion and improve coronary flow reserve by decreasing capillary resistance, and this may provide a novel approach for the treatment of coronary heart disease. Traditionally, DRPs are known to augment pipe flow through reductions in fluid resistance. In vascular systems, similar mechanisms are theorized but the precise microvascular mechanism of action is unknown. Having established the potential health benefits of DRPs in experimental animal models, further clinical development as a therapeutic strategy will require a greater understanding of its microvascular mechanisms. Accordingly, this research program builds on the Pi's intact animal data by investigating DRPs effects at the microcirculatory level. The Principal Investigator will learn sophisticated tools for intravital microcirculation research, including measurements of microvascular pressure, microvascular hematocrit, and red cell and leukocyte kinetics. These techniques will be used to determine whether DRPs enhance perfusion through (1) Alterations in hydrodynamics by increasing precapillary driving pressure; (2) Changing microvascular red cell distribution; (3) Altering leukocyte-endothelial interactions; or a combination thereof. The Principal Investigator's short term goal is to gain a fund of knowledge in the field of the microcirculation and to learn the techniques to answer the questions posed by this proposal. He will then apply his new skill set to address questions in his field of clinical expertise, interventional cardiology. His ultimate goal is to improve treatments aimed at the coronary microcirculation, including treatment of coronary 'no-reflow,' by delving into its microvascular mechanisms. By interrogating the microvascular mechanisms of DRPs, this proposal provides a vehicle to learn these methodologies.    (End of Abstract)"
6780,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Action potentials are generated at the axon initial segment (AIS) and are propagated via saltatory conduction at nodes of Ranvier. These domains are highly enriched in voltage gated Na+ channels, which form a multimeric complex with beta subunits, neuronal cell adhesion molecules, notably neurofascin (NF) 186, and the cytoskeletal proteins ankyrin G and piv spectrin. We have recently demonstrated that targeting of NF186 to PNS nodes is mediated via its extracellular interactions, that it has an essential role in node formation by recruiting ankyrin G via its cytoplasmic domain, and that ankyrin G in turn, is required for the accumulation of sodium channels. In contrast, ankyrin accumulation at initial segments, which is also critical for domain organization is intrinsically specified, independent of NF186. These studies raise a number of key questions. What is the source of proteins targeted to the node and how do they traffic to this site? Are nodal components, once assembled, stably expressed at the node or do they continuously turnover and, if so, is this turnover enhanced by demyelination? Finally, do CNS nodes assemble like PNS nodes (i.e. directed by extracellular signals) or more akin to initial segments (i.e. directed from the inside-out via interactions with ankyrin G)? In this proposal, we address these questions and further characterize mechanisms of node assembly by: i) determining how proteins traffic to PNS nodes, including whether they are recruited from cell surface pools or via directed vesicular transport, ii) live image nodes to examine dynamic changes that occur during development and with demyelination, and iii) examine the dependence of CNS nodes on NF186- dependent signals in cocultures and targeting signals in transgenic mice. These studies should provide important new insights into the axo-glial interactions that regulate the assembly and maintenance of nodes of Ranvier. They will also be an important foundation for elucidating pathogenetic changes at nodes that result from demyelination."
6785,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad purpose of this proposal is to create a framework for bedside decision support to predict life threatening events before they happen. The specific hypothesis is that models predicting cardiac arrest can be generated from physiologic and laboratory data obtained in the 12 hours preceding the event using logistic regression analysis (LR) and data mining techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), Bayesian networks (BN) and decision tree classification (DTC). We further hypothesize that a support vector machine technique will yield the model with the best performance. Specific Aim 1 is to acquire and prepare data for eligible patients by merging information from physiologic, laboratory, and clinical databases and selecting data from twelve hours prior to either a cardiac arrest or the maximum severity of illness. Noise will be removed with automated methods that can be used in real time. Missing data elements will be imputed by statistical methods that are regarded as state of the art. Since the optimum time window to investigate before an arrest has not been established, and since there is no standard process of abstracting trend information, we will generate multiple candidate data sets in an effort to determine the optimum combination of parameters. Data dimensionality will be reduced by three separate feature selection methods, each of which will be used in subsequent modeling procedures. Specific Aim 2 is to create cardiac arrest prediction models from the candidate data sets using LR, SVM, NN, BN and DTC. We will assess model performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC) using 10- fold cross validation. We will then assess the ability to generalize by testing the model on unseen data. We will determine the impact of training sample size on model performance by varying the percentage of data used during the 10-fold cross validation for each modeling technique's best performing model. We will then perform a false prediction analysis to determine the etiology of the false prediction. Specific Aim 3 is to determine which modeling process and configuration parameters performs the best, and to determine optimum timing windows for: time to analyze pre-arrest and size of feature window. The significance of this proposal is that successful prediction and early intervention could save thousands of lives annually."
6867,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and aging are the leading causes of renal and cardiovascular disease. In addition to the important roles played by hypertension, abnormal carbohydrate metabolism, profibrotic growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and advanced glycation end products, abnormal lipid metabolism and accumulation of lipids also play an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity, age, and diabetes-related renal disease. In a) C57BI/6 mice with diet induced obesity and insulin resistance, and b) aging mice and rats, we have found increased renal expression of the nuclear transcriptional factors: I) the sterol regulatory element binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP-1 and SREBP-2), and II) the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), which result in increased synthesis and accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol and correlate with manifestations of obesity and diabetes related renal sclerosis and proteinuria. Recent studies indicate that the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays an important role in lipid metabolism through modulation of SREBP-1 and ChREBP. FXR also has antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects. FXR is highly expressed in the kidney and we have found that its expression and their target enzymes are altered in the kidneys of mice with diet induced obesity and insulin resistance and in aging mice. However the potential role of FXR in preventing renal disease is not known. Our hypotheses are: 1) FXR plays an important role in regulation of renal disease through modulation of renal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress; 2) Treatment with FXR agonists will attenuate obesity and age-related renal disease. Our aims are: 1) To determine the role of FXR ligands in modulation of a) renal disease, b) renal lipid metabolism, c) fibrosis, d) inflammation, and e) oxidative stress in I) mice with diet induced obesity and insulin resistance and II) aging mice; 2) To determine the direct role of FXR in modulation of renal glomerular podocyte response to fatty acids, glucose and insulin, including apoptosis, lipid metabolism, fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress;3) To determine if conditional and inducible a) FXR overexpression in podocytes will significantly attenuate, and alternatively if b) FXR knockout in podocytes will significantly accelerate obesity and insulin resistance or age-related renal disease."
6945,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron deficiency (ID) remains one of the foremost world-wide nutrient deficiencies that affect brain development in the fetus and in children. ID affects at least 3 major aspects of early brain development: energy metabolism (especially in hippocampus (HC)), monoamine neurotransmitter homeostasis, and myelination, in turn potentially affecting behaviors such as recognition memory, procedural memory and speed of processing. In humans and dietary ID animal models, it is unclear whether structural and behavioral effects in the developing brain are due directly to a lack of iron interacting with important transcriptional, translational or post-translational processes or to indirect effects such as hypoxia (due to anemia) or perturbation of the homeostasis of other divalent cations important in brain development such as Zn, Cu or Mn. To circumvent these potential confounders and to directly assess iron's role in the development of the HC, we have generated two non-anemic genetic mouse models by conditionally altering the expression of two iron uptake transport proteins in area CA-1 of the HC. CA-1 is essential to recognition memory function and is altered metabolically, structurally and functionally in dietary ID. Model 1 relies on a CaMKinase II alpha-Cre-lox system to knock-out (KO) divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1), the major intracellular ferrous off-loading protein at embryonic day (E) 18 prior to CA-1 differentiation. This animal has been bred, is non-anemic and needs to be characterized from genotypic and iron phenotypic perspective. Model 2 uses a doxycycline induced (tetracycline transactivator) dominant-negative (DN) approach to functionally reduce the activity of transferrin receptor-1 (TfR-1), the major neuronal transmembrane iron uptake protein, in GA-1 pyramidal neurons. The parent lineages for this animal have been generated and are ready to be bred. The offspring will need to be genotypically and phenotypically characterized. The Specific Aims of this R-21 are to 1) confirm the absence of DMT-1 protein and mRNA, establish the hippocampal iron status and assess the behavioral phenotype of the conditional DMT-1 KO animal, and 2) to breed, confirm the mutation of TfR-1 in HC, establish the CA-1 iron status and assess the behavioral phenotype of the TfR-1 DN animal. The potential pay-offs of this high-risk, high gain proposal are models that define whether and, specifically, how iron is necessary for normal HC development at the molecular, protein and systems level. The models will be used to determine whether the lack of iron, per se, is responsible for the cognitive deficits in humans and animal models with dietary ID without the numerous confounding variables found in dietary models."
6972,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growth factor independence-1 (Gfi-1) is a zinc-finger (ZF) transcriptional repressor that functions as a dominant oncoprotein and cooperates with c-Myc and Pim-1 in lymphomagenesis. Gfi-1 plays an important role in the development of lymphoid and myeloid cells. It has been shown that Gfi-1 represses transcription by binding to specific DNA elements in the target genes. The molecular mechanism by which Gfi-1 represses transcription is still poorly understood. We have observed that Gfi-1 interacts with the POZ domain ZF transcription factor Miz-1, originally identified as a c-Myc interacting protein that mediates c- Myc repression activity. Like c-Myc, Gfi-1 represses activation of the p21Cip promoter by Miz-1. Notably, Gfi-1 also repressed Miz-1-mediated activation of a p21Cip promoter fragment that contains no Gfi-1 binding site. Overexpression of Gfi-1 in myeloid 32D cells inhibited upregulation of p21Cip induced by DNA damage. Furthermore, Gfi-1 and c-Myc acted in collaboration to repress activation of p21Cip by Miz-1 or TGF2 treatment. We hypothesize that Gfi-1 is recruited to p21Cip via Miz-1, thereby repressing p21Cip transcription, and that Gfi-1 may interact with c-Myc, either directly or through Miz-1, resulting in synergistic repression of p21Cip. The specific aims of the current grant proposal are to examine how Gfi-1 represses Miz-1-mediated activation of p21Cip and to investigate the molecular mechanism by which Gfi-1 collaborates with c-Myc in repressing p21Cip. The proposed research may reveal a novel mechanism by which Gfi-1 regulates gene expression and may also shed light on the functional collaboration between Gfi-1 and Myc in lymphomagenesis. Cancer cells have mutations in the genes that control cell growth and survival, and these mutations lead to uncontrolled expansion of cancer cells. In this proposal, we will investigate how a nuclear protein, called Gfi-1, acts to regulate cell growth and survival. Because inappropriate activation of Gfi-1 has been implicated in lymphoma, the proposed research will shed light on the role of Gfi-1 in lymphoma development and will also have implications for designing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer."
6977,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nephrolithiasis (NL) affects up to 10% of the population producing significant pain and suffering, as well as great economic costs (up to $5.3 billion per year in the United States). Treatment strategies are imperfect and have not improved substantially over the last 30 years, in part because the key pathogenic steps remain poorly defined. Therefore, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team to define genetic risk factors for NL. A key and unique resource of our application is the Rochester, MN cohort of the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA), which has conducted genome-wide linkage and association studies to identify genes influencing blood pressure and end-organ complications of hypertension (HTN). Members of the well-characterized GENOA cohort will be phenotyped for kidney stone risk via 24-hour urine measurements of lithogenic factors including calcium, oxalate, citrate, and uric acid excretion, as well as overall crystallization inhibition (upper limit of metastability, ULM). Extensive pre-existing genotyping data of the GENOA cohort will be analyzed via genome-wide linkage, together with selected NL candidate gene associations (vitamin D receptor, soluble adenylate cyclase, intracellular protease  with no lysine  WNK4, chloride channel CLCN5, calcium sensing receptor, urinary prothrombin fragment 1, urate anion transporter 1, oxalate-formate exchanger Slc26a6, Tamm-Horsfall Protein, osteopontin, and bikunin). These studies will determine if specific loci or candidate genes associate with corresponding urinary lithogenic factors (e.g., 24-hr excretion of calcium, oxalate, citrate, or uric acid; ULM). Genetic linkage and association analyses will control for diet and other environmental factors, and assess potential gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. These will be the first studies to assess genetic determinants of urinary lithogenic factors other than calcium in a population-based cohort, taking into account the important covariate of diet. Specific Aims are: Aim #1: Use variance component methods for univariate and multivariate quantitative trait linkage analyses to determine if urinary lithogenic measures (24-hr excretion of calcium, oxalate, citrate, and uric acid; crystallization inhibition) map to specific genomic regions in the GENOA cohort, controlling for dietary factors; Aim #2: Use family-based association methods to determine if urinary lithogenic measures (24-hr excretion of calcium, oxalate, citrate, and uric acid; crystallization inhibition) associate with polymorphisms in selected candidate genes in the GENOA cohort, adjusting for dietary factors, and determine if gene-environment and gene-gene interactions are present. Our goal is to establish genetic associations with urinary NL risk factors in a community- based cohort. The vast experience and infrastructure of GENOA investigators and use of pre-existing genotyping data will allow completion of these studies at a fraction of the cost otherwise required. Results should provide new insight into the pathogenesis of NL, and may lead to identification of new potential treatment targets.Kidney stones are common, and it is known that specific changes in the urinary composition are important risk factors, for example higher than normal calcium excretion. However, the genetic factors that cause these urinary changes have not been well defined. Therefore, in this grant we determine if specific genetic loci or candidate genes associate with kidney stone risk factors in a well-studied population for whom vast amounts of genetic data are already available, the Olmsted County GENOA cohort."
6980,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic clinical pain remains poorly treated. The use of mu opioid analgesics such as morphine can treat the pain, but the severe undesired effects of morphine and other mu agonists limit their use. Indeed, the rapid development of tolerance causes ever increasing doses to be administered, increasing the severity of the undesired effects. Studies have shown the coadministration of a delta opioid antagonist, together with morphine causes a slower build-up of tolerance than administration of morphine alone. Further, the use of a peptide with a dual profile of mu agonism/delta antagonism has been reported to give rise to little tolerance. Thus, the aim of this continuing research project is to develop potent non-peptide mu agonists, which also possess a profile of delta antagonism.    The orvinols (e.g. etorphine) are a class of potent mu opioid agonists, that also interact with kappa and delta receptors, generally displaying delta agonism. Our hypothesis is that the delta efficacy of the orvinols can be reduced by the introduction of an aromatic group in a position that corresponds to the position of the indole in the indolomorphinans (e.g. naltrindole) or the benzylidene in the opioid benzylidenes (e.g. benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX)), two important classes of low efficacy delta opioid ligands. By reducing delta efficacy and retaining high mu efficacy, analogs of the orvinols with the desired profile will result.    The approach to be used consists of the development of a pharmacophore model of delta efficacy using a novel molecular modeling approach, and the design of target molecules with a suitably positioned aromatic ring. Included are 5,14-bridged and 6,14-bridged-morphinan based orvinols selected by the model. Novel chemical methodology will be developed and applied to the synthesis of 6,14-bridged-4,5-epoxymorphinan targets, analogs very closely related to the orvinols. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop potent mu opioid analgesics, to which tolerance develops slowly, or not at all, in order to reduce the undesired effects seen in the chronic treatment of clinical pain."
6987,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is a remarkable metal center that lies at the catalytic heart of a variety of enzymes. The unique and `universal' Moco has the same core structure in all mononuclear molybdenum enzymes (MMEs) and is found in all forms of life. The ability of this cofactor to mediate oxygen atom transfer (OAT) and hydroxylation reactions, has given rise to the diverse family of MMEs. Similarly constituted, MMEs include dehydrogenases (e.g., formate, ethylbenzene), oxidases (e.g., sulfide, xanthine, arsenite), and reductases (e.g., nitrate, arsenate, selenate). In humans, xanthine oxidase and sulfite oxidase fulfill crucial functions in redox reactions in sulfur and purine metabolism. Microbial MMEs also indirectly impact human health through transformation of nitrate and arsenic. Defects in cofactor synthesis can result in severe physiological abnormalities leading to death. A fundamental question in biology and medicine is how has the basic unit of Moco been tuned to fulfill the various functions. The ultimate goal of our research is to better understand the reactivity of MMEs through an integrated program of inorganic, organic, physical, and reactivity studies. The broad questions that we are interested in answering are: What controls the reactivity in MMEs? How does the physical structure impose electronic structures that support the same substrate transformation with different active sites? How do these active sites influence the different phases of the catalytic cycle i.e., substrate binding, product formation, product releases and regeneration of the active site? These questions will be addressed by investigating the OAT reactivity and redox properties of molybdenum complexes and examining influence imposed by individual components of the cofactor. We will also synthesize and fully characterize oxo molybdenum complexes of dithione ligands, and investigate their properties. In addition, we conduct transmetallation reaction from copper to molybdenum, and complete the synthesis of the closest analog of pyranopterin cofactor. In accordance with the guideline of R15 program we will continue to train next generation of scientists. This proposal seeks to address fundamental questions relating to a class of enzymes that are important to human health though a hypothesis driven research."
6992,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The IMSD Scholars Program in Brown University's Division of Biology and Medicine will significantly increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) Ph.D. students trained for careers in basic biomedical and public health research. Efforts already initiated have doubled our percentage of URM students in the past three years. This IMSD Program is projected to again double (to 20%) the URM population in the Division's 10 doctoral programs. The IMSD grant will fund 5-7 doctoral students per year for up to two years. First year students will be appointed via a selective process and provided with the necessary support, advising, mentoring, and developmental tools to overcome deficiencies in academic preparation or other disadvantages and successfully attain a PhD. The PIs will oversee continuous and detailed evaluation with internal and external oversight to permit assessment of progress toward goals, the ability to adjust strategy as needed, and provide incentives for advancing a culture of diversity within Ph.D. training.     Three specific aims are proposed. (1) Enhance and expand strategic partnerships with institutions that are minority-serving or train large numbers of URM students. In addition to new partnerships, we will improve our long-standing relationships with the Leadership Alliance and Brown-Tougaloo Program, and develop relationships with professional organizations serving the academic interests of URM students. (2) Implement a Multifaceted Personalized Educational Program for IMSD Scholars that provides a continuous-to-degree advising and support structure empowering students to develop their full potential. The program core is a menu of training modules designed specifically for IMSD Scholars. Seminars, advising meetings, IMSD Scholar-faculty functions, a peer mentor network, student-faculty compacts, an interactive program website, and an annual retreat with external and internal advisors provide integration and continuity within the program. All IMSD faculty trainers have federal funding and a record of successfully mentoring URM trainees. (3) Improve divisional diversity practices in Ph.D. training by raising awareness of the benefits faculty mentors and their research programs derive from investments in this area and by providing an institutional structure that sets expectations for diversity and rewards achievement. As faculty beyond the initial group of mentors observe the successes of this group and seek out IMSD Scholars for their own labs, they will receive incentives. The eventual outcomes of this aim will be measured by increases in the number of (a) URM students overall, (b) individual doctoral programs with a critical mass of URM students, and (c) faculty labs with URM students doing thesis research. The IMSD's administrative home in the Dean's office provides the leadership and accountability to effect positive change and advance the institutional culture.     In percent terms, the number of underrepresented minorities (URM) earning Ph.D.s in biological and health sciences falls far below their percentage of the overall U.S. population. This is a major problem because contrasted to the majority population, URM populations in the U.S. have significant disparities in access to health care and outcomes related to personal health. To overcome these biases, large numbers of qualified URM Ph.D.s must be produced. The proposed IMSD program will double the number of URM students entering Ph.D. training in biology and public health at Brown University through proven training, retention/advising and assessment strategies that involve strong leadership, internal and external advisory oversight, and strong institutional commitment."
7028,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The organization of the nucleus into distinct structural and functional domains is important for normal chromosomal processes like transcription and replication and disruption of this organization is known to lead to disease states like cancer and developmental defects. Thus understanding how the nucleus is organized and responds to stimuli should help us better manipulate processes for benefit in research and medicine. The overall objective of this proposal is to reach a mechanistic understanding of the structure and organization of domains in eukaryotic chromosomes. Adjacent domains in the nucleus often have antagonistic structural or functional properties and determining the precise structural and molecular properties of different domains will be necessary to understand how the nucleus is organized. While DNA insulator elements have been identified that separate distinct functional domains, the elements that separate the structurally defined chromosomal domains are not well defined. Understanding the relationships between the functional and structural elements that organize the nucleus is a key focus this proposal. The mechanisms involved in separating distinct chromatin domains is just beginning to be understood and likely involve post-translational modifications of histones as well as attachment of chromatin loops to proteinaceous superstructures, many mechanistic questions remain and is also an area of inquiry proposed in this research grant. The research will involve use of molecular genetics and genomics, manipulation of chromatin using techniques like quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitations, and chromosome conformation capture and biochemical analysis to identify factors regulating insulator elements and chromatin loop formation. Given that many nuclear proteins and the basic structure of chromatin is conserved from yeast to humans, these studies will help discern general principles of chromatin domain dynamics that can be extrapolated to gene regulation in humans. Since alterations in chromatin architecture is known to cause states like cancer and developmental defects, the results from this study will be useful in developing new strategies for treating these disease states and also in developing better molecular tools for gene therapy."
7033,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a major cause of lung disease in humans, and the initial interaction with airway epithelial cells is likely to contribute to subsequent disease development. It is clear that immune responses against mycoplasma are a major component of disease with the recruitment and development of immune-mediated inflammatory responses in the submucosa of the respiratory tract. Thus, the factors produced by airway epithelial cells are likely to influence the pathogenesis of these immune-mediated lesions; however, the full complement of cytokines/chemokines produced by airway epithelial cells is unknown. Furthermore, the mechanisms and mycoplasma components involved in the activation of these cells is uncharacterized. If understood, this information could facilitate the development of new approaches to intervene in mycoplasma and other pulmonary diseases. The long-term objective of this project is to determine the molecular mechanisms central to the generation of immune responses in mycoplasma respiratory disease. This project proposes to test the hypothesis that M. pneumoniae stimulate human respiratory bronchoepithelial cells to produce chemokines or other cytokines that are likely to contribute to the inflammatory lesions. Furthermore, we propose that mycoplasma adhesion protein promote the interaction between mycoplasma lipoproteins and toll-like receptors (TLR) of respiratory epithelial cells, which in turn stimulate the production these factors by epithelial cells. Specifically, we proposed to address the following questions: 1) Do M. pneumoniae membrane components activate or damage human bronchoepithelial cells and is this dependent on adhesion molecules? 2) Does M. pneumoniae stimulate human bronchoepithelial cells via toll-like receptors (TLR)? The experimental designs are: 1) Viable mycoplasma, mycoplasma membranes and lipoproteins will stimulate a human bronchoepithelial cell line. Cytokine/chemokine mRNA and protein levels will be determined. We will compare the activity of an adherent parental mycoplasma strain with a nonadherent strain. 2) The expression of TLR by bronchoepithelial cells will be monitored before and after mycoplasma stimulation. Cell lines lacking TLR will be transfected with plasmids expressing each of the human TLR to determine their roles in mycoplasma (cell, membranes and lipoproteins) stimulation of cells. The role of the TLR on human bronchoepithelial cells will be determined using blocking antibodies or transfection with inactive forms of TLR. These studies will provide the foundation for future studies to further elucidate the molecular events involved in these responses, and examine the role of epithelium-derived chemokines/cytokines in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, it is likely that these events contribute to the exacerbation of asthma and other respiratory diseases. Thus, modulation of each of these events may lead to novel therapies against mycoplasma and other chronic respiratory diseases. The bacterium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, is responsible for  walking pneumonia  which comprises at least 30% of the pneumonia cases in the United States and associated with severe asthma. The proposed research will study the mechanism through which this bacterium causes lung disease and more severe asthma. Ultimately, we expect these studies will lead to more effective treatments of diseases due to this bacterium by means of promoting favorable, rather than harmful, responses within the lungs of patients."
7035,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading heritable form of mental retardation, and is a leading single-gene disorder associated with autism. FXS is a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder that generally arises when the CGG element of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene expands beyond ~200 repeats (full mutation); such expansions are usually accompanied by methylation-coupled silencing. Absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP) leads to FXS. By contrast, carriers of smaller (permutation; 55-200 CGG repeats) alleles have elevated FMR1 mRNA levels in peripheral blood leucocytes and brain, by as much as five- to ten-fold for males with permutation alleles that exceed 100 repeats. We have recently discovered a new disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) that specifically involves premutation carriers; evidence to date suggests that this disorder is caused by a pathologic  gain-of-function  of the elevated FMR1 mRNA itself. More recent evidence suggests that the elevated mRNA may also have neurodevelopment consequences for some children with premutation alleles. The principal objective of the proposed research is to identify the mechanism(s) by which transcriptional activity is increased for alleles in the premutation range, and decreased for alleles in the full mutation range. The motivation for these studies is the eventual correction of the dysregulation in both CGG repeat ranges. We propose to identify the basis for increased transcription for expanded alleles in the premutation range (Aims 1 and 2), and to characterize the properties of the transcriptionally silenced gene for alleles in the full mutation range (Aim 3). These studies will utilize a combination of cloning/transfection strategies, and will capitalize on the vast resource of hundreds of cell pools from patients with alleles spanning normal, premutation, and full mutation ranges. This resource includes dozens of cell pools from methylation and size mosaics, and more than fifty transformed lines, to date, from individuals in all three repeat expansion ranges. The proposed studies should facilitate the development of treatments for fragile X syndrome and for clinical conditions among (premutation) carriers of the fragile X gene. The public health impact of this effort is underscored by the fact that there are estimated to be at least 500,000 premutation carriers, and nearly 100,000 individuals with full mutation forms of the fragile X gene in the US."
7038,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Magnetic resonance imaging has shown that normal brain development continues into the mid-to-late 40's when maximal white matter volumes are reached in the frontal and temporal lobes. This confirms postmortem evidence suggesting that myelination of these brain areas continues into the 40's. Myelin is crucial for normal brain function because it increases the speed of axonal transmission. The increase in myelination is well regulated and occurs in concert with a decrease in gray matter volume resulting in a constant brain volume in adulthood. Schizophrenia is believed to be a disease caused in part by abnormal brain development. We observed that when examined crossectionally, brain development was dysregulated in adult schizophrenic subjects with an absence of normal myelination in adulthood. This project will examine gray and white matter volume changes in schizophrenia and normal adults prospectively by rescanning cohorts of subjects that were initially scanned 5 and 11 years ago. The project will more definitively test the theory that in schizophrenia, brain development is dysregulated in adulthood and will examine whether patients that have a poor outcome are particularly likely to suffer from this developmental problem in adulthood. If confirmed, the prevailing concept of a fixed and therefore unreparable brain developmental problem causing all schizophrenia will be surpassed.  This will change our concept of how we could treat this illness, the feasibility of changing its lifelong course, and would encourage the development of novel pharmacologic interventions to improve myelination."
7048,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enveloped viruses are formed by a budding process that occurs following the assembly of viral components at cellular membranes. The late steps leading up to membrane fission and particle release appear to be accomplished in many cases through manipulation of host machinery that is recruited to virus assembly sites. As paramyxoviruses lack the same late domain sequences used by many other enveloped viruses, such as retroviruses, for host factor recruitment, the steps leading up to the release of paramyxovirus particles are poorly understood. Recently, we identified an alternative sequence, FPIV, within the matrix (M) protein of the paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 (SV5) that can functionally substitute for the PTAP late domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) for budding. Here, we propose experiments to further investigate mechanisms by which paramyxoviruses manipulate host machinery to facilitate virus budding. Our first aim is to investigate the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in SV5 budding by testing the possibility that SV5 M protein is a direct target for the attachment of ubiquitin molecules. We will attempt to prevent this ubiquitination from occurring through removal of lysine residues near the FPIV sequence of M protein. Our second aim is to define the subset of individual Class E proteins that is important for SV5 budding and that is recruited to SV5 assembly sites. Our third aim is to identify host proteins that bind to SV5 M protein, test the importance of M-interacting proteins for SV5 budding, and assess whether binding occurs in a way that is dependent on the FPIV sequence. Our fourth aim is to investigate the unique role of SV5 NP protein in the budding of virus-like particles. Relevance to public health: Paramyxoviruses are responsible for a wide range of diseases that affect both humans and animals, including measles and mumps. A better understanding of paramyxovirus budding will provide a foundation for future efforts towards the development of antiviral drugs that target this step of the virus lifecycle."
7065,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) receptors, and urocortin, a member of the CRH family of peptides, has recently been discovered expressed in outer hair cells and olivocochlear terminals, respectively. While analysis of the role played by urocorUn, the only known ligand expressed in the inner ear capable of activating the CRH receptors, has been analyzed using urocortin deficient mice, nothing is known of the developmental expression pattern or role of the CRH receptors in the inner ear. The CRH receptors are G protein coupled receptors, and stimulate the cAMP second messenger-signaling cascade. We hypothesize that activation of the CRH receptors may represent one phenomenon underlying protection from noise induced hearing loss. The mechanisms of action may include phosphorylation and inactivation of the sK2 calcium-activated apamin-sensitive potassium channel. In order to further analyze the morphological aspects of the CRH system in the cochlea, its functional role in hearing and protection from noise induced hearing loss, and finally, to assess the cellular mechanisms of action associated with activation of the CRH receptors, three specific aims are proposed. First, we will establish the developmental and adult expression pattern of the CRH receptors in the inner ear. Successful completion of the experiments of this specific aim will establish the precise identity of the cells within the inner ear that express the CRH receptors, and identify the postsynaptic elements of the urocortin immunopositive fibers at the ultra structural level. Second, we will establish the functional roles CRH plays in hearing, and whether they participate in protection of the inner ear from noise induced hearing loss. This aim will be accomplished using mice that lack the gene for either the type 1 or the type 2 CRH receptor, or that lack both. Finally, we will use these mice to establish whether there are alterations in cAMP induced phosphorylation of targets in the outer hair cells following CRH receptors gene ablation. Success in this aim will allow us to identify individual proteins phosphorylated due to activation of the CRH receptors, as well as their role in modulating normal olivocochlear synaptic activity. This will functionally link the urocortin hormone/CRH receptor and classical ACh neurotransmitter systems together in a unified model explaining inner ear based protection from noise induced hearing loss."
7070,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prefrontal cortex (RFC) GABAergic interneurons are a major target for the molecular pathology associated with schizophrenia (SZ) morbidity; their alteration may contribute to the reduction of cortical neuropil, which is an important component of SZ pathophysiology. Cortical GABAergic neurons participate in the orchestration of cortical pyramidal neuron population firing via the release of GABA on GABAA and GABAB receptors and modulate dendritic spine plasticity via the translation of spine resident mRNAs facilitated by the GABAergic neuron release of reelin acting on integrin receptors located on dendritic spine postsynaptic densities. In SZ cortical GABAergic neurons, the synthesis of GABA and reelin is reduced because of a downregulation in GAQ67 and reelin mRNA expressions. Very probably this is due to an increased expression in GABAergic neurons of DNA-(cytosine 5)-methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) that contributes to the epigenetic hypermethylation of CpG islands and promoters expressed in reelin and GAD67 genes and to the consequent decreased synthesis of these two gene transcripts. Thus, we hypothesize that downregulation of GABAergic function due to an epigenetic mechanism may be an important primary process operative in SZ morbidity. We will study whether: 1) in addition to BA9 and BA10 GABAergic neurons, DNMT1 is coexpressed with reelin and GAD67, in the GABAergic neurons of the occipital cortex and caudate nucleus; 2) in every GABAergic neuron, the increase of DNMT1 expression coincides with a decrease of reelin and GAD67 expression; 3) the increase of DNMT1 and the decrease of reelin and GAD67 expression also extend to brains of bipolar disorder patients; 4) DNMT1 establishes a partnership with complexes including histone deacetylases and histone methylases, two prominent enzymes to regulate the code whereby histones control accessibility of transcription factors or DNMT1 to targeted regulatory sites in gene promoters. A better understanding of how epigenetic mechanisms can regulate reelin and GAD67 gene transcription may allow the discovery of new drug targets that can reprogram transcription and perhaps modify pathologies related to epigenetically-induced downregulation of gene expression in SZ."
7104,HHS,NSF,"The long-term objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular and cellular pathways activated by thebinding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to Pseudomonas aeruginosawhich initiates a cascade of effective host innate immune responses that fail to occur in individuals with CF.This underlies their hypersusceptibility to life shortening, chronic P. aeruginosa infection. The aims are di-rected at analyzing how binding of P. aeruginosa to CFTR initiates release of interleukin-1 (IL-1), rapid acti-vation and nuclear entry of NF-KB via signaling through the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), recruitment of CFTR andother proteins to membrane lipid rafts, and initiation of. other epithelial cell responses including bacterial in-gestion, cytokine secretion and apbptosis. Studies with human cells with WT or mutant CFTR infected withP. aeruginosa will determine the kinetics and magnitude of IL-1 release and IL-1 R signaling through the mo-lecular adaptor MyD88 to define the contribution of CFTR to these responses. Transgenic mice lacking thesemediators will be evaluated in a model of chronic P. aeruginosa oropharyngeal infection for loss of resis-tance to infection, which occurs in transgenic CF mice. Additional cellular studies will analyze the contribu-tion to effective innate immunity of 5 proteins¿major vault protein; Carmal; Pag/Cbp; Clathrin; and migra-tion inhibition factor¿identified as rapidly entering into membrane lipid rafts in a CFTR-dependent fashionfollowing epithelial cell infection with P. aeruginosa. Readouts include release of IL-1, NF-xB activation, en- .docytosis of P. aeruginosa, cytokine secretion, and apoptosis. Transgenic mice lacking one of these factors,or mice treated with short-interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down the production of the factor in the lung, willbe evaluated for their susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection. siRNA to CFTR will also be used in vitro todetermine if a CF-phenotype can be produced in a cell with endogenous WT-CFTR. siRNA to CFTR will beinoculated into the lungs of mice to transiently knock down protein expression, the animals then chronicallyinfected with P. aeruginosa, and the suppression of CFTR production relieved at various time points toevaluate the effect of restoration of wild-type (WT)-CFTR function on the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa in-fection. These studies will help define strategies for use in clinical trials of drugs or therapies designed to in-duce WT-CFTR function in CF patients. Overall, an enhanced understanding of the normal resistance to P.aeruginosa infection and the role of CFTR in this process will be obtained from the proposed aims."
7123,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia affects 3-5% of pregnancies and contributes significantly to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. We have generated a novel hypothesis regarding the development of pre-eclampsia that postulates that two primary features contribute independently to its development. One feature is a pre-pregnancy phenotype that includes reduced plasma volume, elevated sympathetic tone, reduced utenne blood flow and enhanced platelet activation. This feature has been suggested by the association of a specific genetic polymorphism of angiotensinogen (TT235) with an increased risk for pre-eclampsia. This polymorphism has been linked in our preliminary data to key pathophysiologic features of pre-eclampsia, previously thought to be exclusive to pregnancy, in women who are examined prior to pregnancy. The second feature is the physiologic volume expansion of pregnancy. We have theorized that the overt clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia become apparent in late pregnancy as a result of either 1) a normal volume expansion in women unable to tolerate it due to a chronic adaptation to low intravascular volume (abnormal prepregnancy phenotype) or 2) an excessive volume expansion in women with a normal prepregnancy phenotype (i.e. twins, molar pregnancies). In this grant we propose to examine 3 primary specific aims, employing detailed whole body physiologic measurements in women, that will support this pathophysiologic view of the development of preeclampsia; 1) We will confirm that the angiotensinogen genotype that has been linked to preeclampsia in Caucasians and Asians is associated with reduced plasma volume in a nulligravid population and that this plasma volume constriction is associated with elevated sympathetic tone, reduced uterine blood flow and heightened platelet activation prior to pregnancy, 2) As we follow these women into pregnancy we will demonstrate; a) that low prepregnancy plasma volume is associated with elevated sympathetic tone and reduced uterine blood flow in early pregnancy (12 weeks) predisposing to abnormal placentation despite similar plasma volume expansion, and b) that prepregnancy plasma volume is indirectly related to both the change in mean arterial pressure (corrected for plasma volume expansion) and degree of platelet activation in the third trimester, 3) Finally, we will demonstrate that pregnancy results in an increase in both post-puerperal plasma volume and arterial compliance Iowering the risk for both preeclampsia in future pregnancies and hypertension in later life. This will be a controlled prospective longitudinal study examining an integrated pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the development of preeclampsia. This study proposes to evaluate a novel hypothesis that synthesizes apparently contradictory data into a single coherent theory."
7129,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of HIV infection in the United States iincreasing fastest in women, particularly those of African American and Hispanic descent. Moreover, approximately 11% of AIDS cases reported to the CDC are women over the age of 50. The introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly HIV protease inhibitors, has extended survival of HIV-infected patients. However, their use has been accompanied by the emergence of several metabolic complications, among them low bone mass. Although postmenopausal women are at high risk for bone loss and fractures, published studies of bone mass and mineral metabolism in HIV/AIDS patients have not included older women. We have observed that over 40% of minority postmenopausal HIV+ women have osteoporosis. It is therefore essential that future research specifically target this group. The pathogenesis of excess bone loss associated with HIV infection is complex. Low body weight, chronic illness, malnutrition, malabsorption, calcium and vitamin D deficiency, and especially in postmenopausal women, estrogen deficiency, may contribute. Bone loss may also result from pathophysiologic interactions between HIV infection and ART and osteoclasts, osteoblasts and other elements within the bone microenvironment. In this proposal, we will: 1. Establish the prevalence of osteoporosis and rates of bone loss; 2. Elucidate the pathogenesis of bone loss; and 3. Delineate the effects of ART on bone structure and turnover in HIV+ African American and Hispanic postmenopausal women. We will use standard and novel methods: dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, serum measurements of bone turnover markers and cytokines, in vitro assays of osteoclastogenesis utilizing peripheral blood mononuclear cells and marrow mononuclear cells, quantitative bone histomorphometry and micro-computed tomography of iliac crest bone biopsies obtained before and after initiation of ART. We will demonstrate that osteoporosis is more prevalent and rates of bone loss more rapid in HIV+ than normal postmenopausal women, that alterations in the RANK/RANKL/OPG osteoclast signaling system are central to the pathogenesis of the osteoporosis, and that ART, particularly regimens that include ritonavir, is important in causing the bone loss.  The results of these studies will have important therapeutic implications for the management of the growing number of postmenopausal women with HIV/AIDS."
7140,HHS,NSF,"The long-term objective of this research program is to understand how the sequence of a proteindetermines its structure, stability, folding kinetics, and ability to be denatured spontaneously and byenzymes. This is one of the central, unsolved problems in molecular biology and is important becauseprotein folding is a prerequisite of most biological processes, and protein unfolding and misfolding oftenlead to disease. In addition, much of the promise of biotechnology for improving human health dependson our eventual ability to manipulate the function of proteins by altering their sequences and structures.We will probe fundamental issues in protein folding and design using P22 Arc repressor and  switch Arc, a variant in whichthe (3-sheet of the wild-type protein is replaced by a pair of helices. Arc providesan excellent model system for studying the folding and association of a single-domain dirneric proteinusing genetic, biochemical, and biophysical methods. Switch Arc provides an opportunity to study thesequence determinants of structural specificity and the stepwise evolution of a protein fold. These studieswill be important for testing and refining our understanding of the sequence determinants of proteinstructure and stability, and for evaluating how well computational algorithms serve to explain and/orpredict the effects of sequence changes on structure and stability. Some proteins and assemblies are toostable for spontaneous unfolding/dissociation to be a biologically relevant reaction, and energy-dependentdisassembly chaperones play critical intracellular roles in dismantling such complexes, in solubilizingaggregates, and in mediating protein degradation. To begin to understand these processes, we will dissectthe biochemical and enzymatic properties of ClpX¿a hexameric-ring ATPase¿which catalyzes proteindenaturation and regulates the activity of the ClpXP protease. By studying ClpX transactions with a largenumber of different protein substrates, we will determine how the local stability and dynamical probitiesof these substrates affect enzyme-mediated denaturation. Enzymes related to ClpX are important virulencedeterminants in some pathogenic bacteria, play roles in regulation of bio-film formation, and function in key processes in mammalian cells, including proteasome-mediated protein degradation and vesicle fusion."
7148,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural circuits provide the physical infrastructure that supports behavior, and a major goal in neuroscience is to understand how circuits function to control behavior. At present, genetic strategies for disrupting circuit function within an intact animal focus on altering the function of single cells. However, most neurons synapse with multiple cells, and there is currently no general strategy for specifically altering just a subset of a neuron's contacts. The goal of this project is to create a genetic system for intentionally disrupting a subset of a neuron's connections, permitting the dissection of neural circuits at the level of the single contact or the single synapse. We propose to achieve our goal in Drosophila by creating artificially engineered regulators of growth cone movement that can be used to intentionally sculpt patterns of neuronal connectivity. The initial aim of the project involves characterizing a series of artificially engineered ligand/receptor pairs to determine which are able to influence growth cone navigation in the fly without unintended side effects. The second aim of the project involves characterizing the ability of these selected ligand/receptor pairs to alter the connectivity of an individually identified neuron to its identified targets, examining the consequences using histology and electrophysiology. The final aim of the project involves applying the ligand/receptor system to a well- characterized neural circuit for learning and memory, using the ligand/receptor system to dissect the functional importance of specific connections within the neural circuit. The tools developed in this work will be immediately usable by other investigators to manipulate various neural circuits in Drosophila. The tools created here could be used in other cell types for other purposes, such as the disruption of cell migration or cell contact. In addition, while this proposal will provide proof-of-principle development in the fly, variations on the strategy developed here should be feasible in mammals and could have applications as both experimental and engineering tools. The wiring pattern of the nervous system provides the physical framework for human behavior, including such fundamental processes of relevance to human health such as learning and memory. This proposal proposes to develop new ways to manipulate the wiring of the nervous system in order to study how it controls behavior. These developments will lead to new insights into learning and memory and potential applications of the basic strategy developed in this grant could be used to alter connections for therapeutic purposes."
7153,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  How specificity is maintained when distinct eukaryotic signal transduction systems share components is a central issue in cell biology that is highly relevant to human cancer. Our long-term objective is a detailed molecular understanding of this ubiquitous phenomenon. To address this question, we have exploited the powerful model system of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. In this organism, eight proteins are shared between two MAP kinase cascades that signal two distinct developmental programs: 1) the mating pheromone response, and 2) the switch of filamentous growth. Pheromone signaling activates the mating pathway MAPK Fus3. However, due to the sharing of upstream kinases, a fraction of the filamentation pathway MAPK Kss2 is also activated. Our work has revealed that the effects of cross-talk are suppressed because Fus3 induces the phosphorylation and destruction of Tec1, the transcription factor that is activated inducing filamentation-specific transcription via Tec1. To further our understanding of signaling specificity, we will identify the determinants of Tec1 degradation kinetics during mating differentiation, test the hypothesis that there are rapid mechanisms by which Tec1 is inactivated prior to its bulk degradation, and determine how Tec1 is inactivated by the Hog1 MAPK to prevent cross-talk during salt-induced activation of the HOG pathway. Although signaling mechanisms are involved in numerous pathological processes, our studies relate in a particularly important way to human cancer. Tumor proliferation is caused in part by the inappropriate activation of growth-promoting signaling pathways, particularly the Erk MAP kinase pathway, because ras activity induces senescence in precancerous lesions but proliferation in frank malignancies, yet at understanding the principles that determine the specificity of MAP kinase signaling and therefore speak to this central question in oncogenesis."
7165,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical ischemia of the lower limbs remains a serious problem in vascular surgery with a substantial fraction of patients undergoing eventual amputation despite surgical bypass and catheter-directed therapies. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive in vivo transcription of genes essential for correction of ischemia remain largely undefined, and are a potential area for the development of therapeutic regimens for tissue ischemia. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes critical for angiogenesis and arteriogenesis induced by tissue ischemia. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) is transcriptionally induced in tissue ischemia and is a critical enzyme for angiogenesis and arterial enlargement. The molecular mechanisms for transcriptional induction of MMP-2 and the significance of MMP-2 upregulation in ischemia in vivo remain unknown. Therefore, we propose to test the central hypotheses of this proposal: Tissue ischemia induces MMP-2 transcription via specific cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements and MMP-2 expression plays a critical role in the angiogenesis and arteriogenesis induced by ischemia. This hypothesis will be tested with the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine the regions within the MMP-2 promoter that are critical for in vivo transcriptional activation by ischemia, 2) To identify the transcription factors responsible for ischemia-induced MMP-2 transcription in vivo and characterize their activation by specific mediators in vivo, 3) To determine if MMP-2 is critical to the revascularization response after ischemia and to examine the effect of cell type-specific overexpression of MMP-2 on ischemia-induced angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in vivo. Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms that induce MMP-2 expression in vivo will increase our knowledge of transcriptional activation of critical genes by tissue ischemia, and form the foundation for the development of molecular therapy for critical limb ischemia in patients."
7176,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the impact of living in poverty on children's development is as important as ever, given that the child poverty rate in the U.S. has remained stable at 18 percent for the last several years (National Center for Children in Poverty, 2006) and is the second highest in the industrialized world (only slightly less than Mexico: UNICEF, 2005). Recent advances in research on socioeconomic disadvantage and child development by our research team and others have shifted concern from whether income poverty has an impact on children's outcomes to more complex questions regarding how poverty takes a toll on children, questions of greater relevance to the design of program and policy innovations. Thus our objective in this current proposal is to strengthen the field's understanding of the mechanisms through which families' trajectories of income and hardship affect children's trajectories of success versus difficulty in academic and socio-emotional domains. In addition, we propose to expand our empirical lens beyond families to the important contribution of school socio-economic disadvantage to children's development. In what represents a synthesis of the investigators' expertise in developmental psychology, social work, education, public policy, and sociology, we propose to address the following aims: Aim I: To examine how the timing, sequence, and duration of changes in family- level disadvantage impact the development of children's academic skills and social-emotional competence across elementary school and into middle school. Aim II: To apply the theoretical frame of specificity of environmental action to understanding the impact of school-level disadvantage on children's academic achievement and social-emotional competence. Aim III: To examine the independent, joint and sequential dynamic impacts of family-level and school-level contextual transitions on families' income and hardship and in turn on the development of children's achievement and social-emotional competence. We will analyze data from all five waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to address these aims. Findings from this research have the potential to contribute to policy and program advances that will enhance the life chances of children in poor and low income families. This project aims to understand the mechanisms through which family-level and school-level poverty and disadvantage affect children's cognitive and social-emotional development from kindergarten through 8th grade. Findings from this research have the potential to contribute to policy and program advances that will enhance the life chances of children in poor and low income families."
7197,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In previous studies, we and others showed evidence for the aberrant re-expression of a series of cell cycle-related proteins in specific vulnerable neuronal populations in Alzheimer disease (AD). That a mitotic cell cycle-related mechanism may play an important role in disease pathogenesis is highlighted by the earlier occurrence of cell cycle proteins compared to abnormal tau in AD and by their appearance at the very earliest prodrominal phase of disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment). Furthermore, that cell cycle proteins are representative of a true cell cycle, rather than being an epiphenomena of other processes, is evident from evidence showing that there is a true mitotic alteration that leads to DNA replication (i.e., S phase) in neurons in AD. These findings led us to develop a novel hypothesis that neurodegeneration in AD, like cancer, is a disease of inappropriate cell cycle control. In support of this notion, we found that the expression a powerful cell cycle inducer, MYC, drives primary neurons to re-enter the cell cycle and, moreover, that MYC-induced cell cycle re-entry leads to tau phosphorylation. Based on these in vitro findings, we have recently developed a bitransgenic mouse model that inducibly expresses MYC specifically in forebrain neurons (CaMKII-MYC). In our preliminary analysis of these CaMKII-MYC animals, we found that MYC expression in this animal model: 1) drives neurons to enter the cell cycle; 2) causes hyperphosphorylation of tau; 3) leads to accumulation of intraneuronal AB; 4) results in a  neurodegenerative  (TUNEL) Phenotype; 5) leads to gliosis; and 6) causes major cognitive deficits (Y- maze and MWM). Since the aforementioned pathological and behavioral changes are all synonymous with AD, this mouse may be a very useful model of disease pathogenesis. The goal of this proposal is to further delineate the importance of neuronal cell cycle re-entry using this CaMKII-MYC animal model (Aim 1) and examine the effects of neuronal cell cycle re-entry under A2-rich conditions by analysis of a triple transgenic Tg2576/CaMKII-MYC mice (Aim 2). At the conclusion of these studies, we hope to not only have advanced our understanding of fundamental mechanisms that control neuronal cell cycle, particularly as it applies to AD, but also suggest novel therapies that could be manipulated to either prevent initiation of degeneration or stimulate recovery of damaged neurons in neurodegenerative conditions. Alzheimer disease is the leading cause of dementia in the United States. Recent studies have implicated inappropriate cell cycle re-entry in vulnerable neurons as playing a role in the neuronal loss, pathology, and cognitive impairment that are characteristic of the disease. This proposal will help to clarify the role of cell cycle re-entry in Alzheimer disease by characterizing a novel transgenic mouse model of cell cycle re-entry and delineating the effects of cell cycle re-entry in an amyloid-rich environment."
7258,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pulmonary disease remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite the molecular insights afforded by identification of the responsible gene, CFTR, a clear understanding of the pathogenesis of lung disease in CF remains elusive. The CF lung is characterized by dysregulated inflammatory responses and chronic airway infection, the end result being progressive bronchiectatic destruction of the airways. The airway inflammatory response in CF is persistently neutrophilic; in turn, the products of activated neutrophils are largely responsible for lung destruction in CF. Lipoxins (LX) are anti-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites, generated during inflammation. Docosatrienes (DT) are docosahexaenoic acid metabolites with similar bioactivities generated constitutively as well as during inflammation. In a variety of models, LX and DT have been shown to prevent neutrophilmediated damage and promote the resolution of neutrophil-mediated inflammation. We have found that LX concentrations are suppressed in the airways of patients with CF, as well as in Cftr-deficient mice. We have also found that administration of a metabolically stable LX analog in a mouse model of the chronic airway inflammation and infection of CF suppresses neutrophilic inflammation and markedly attenuates disease severity. We have further found that, unlike Cftr-sufficient littermates, Cftr-deficient mice are deficient in pulmonary expression of DT, at baseline, prior to any bacterial challenge of the airway. This data strongly suggest the following hypotheses: (a) there is a pathophysiologically important defect in LX-and DT mediated anti-inflammatory activity in the CF lung; and (b) LX and DT analogues have therapeutic potential for preventing and/or ameliorating pathogenic inflammatory responses in CF. In these studies we aim to: (a) define the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of LX in mouse models of CF-related pulmonary infection and inflammation; (b) determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for LX deficiency in CF; and (c) define the role of DT in CF-related pulmonary inflammation."
7267,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human papillomaviruses (HPV) encode proteins that are necessary for viral replication but also lead to the development of cancer. HPV type 16 is the most prevalent member of the group of HPVs associated with high-risk for neoplastic progression. The HPV E6 and E7 genes are selectively expressed in cervical cancers. High-risk HPV E6 proteins are best known for their ability to bind and degrade p53 and were recently reported to stimulate expression of telomerase. The HPV E6 protein is known to have p53 independent activities and to bind multiple cellular proteins. The goal of this project is to identify the functions of E6 necessary for viral genome replication in keratinocytes and compare and contrast the functions necessary for epithelial cell transformation. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that a subset of E6 functions is necessary for HPV replication in human keratinocytes. Our approach is to clone a series of HPV 16 E6 mutations into the HPV genome and evaluate their ability to support episomal replication. Viral genome replication will be studied in monolayer and raft culture models. The mutant E6 proteins will be characterized for interactions with a subset of the E6 binding proteins and for ability to stimulate expression of hTERT, the catalytic unit of telomerase. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that a distinct subset of E6 functions is necessary for epithelial cell immortalization and tumorigenic transformation. While E6 induced telomerase activation appears to be necessary for epithelial cell immortalization, the role of p53 is more complex. In some immortalized epithelial cells, p53 levels are normal but the integrity of the p53 pathway has not been carefully examined. We have found that cells immortalized by an E6 mutant unable to degrade p53 have a blunted response to and overcome growth inhibition induced by p14ARF. In contrast growth of hTERT immortalized cells is repressed by constitutive p14ARF expression. These data suggest that E6 may inhibit p53 in a manner distinct from inducing its degradation. In addition, the roles of most E6 binding partners in human keratinocyte immortalization and transformation have not been tested. We will critically evaluate the functions and activities of E6 required for human keratinocyte transformation with particular interest on the p14ARF-p53 and telomerase pathways, and potentially uncover other E6 connections to cell growth control."
7295,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA silencing is a novel, major biological mechanism controlling gene expression at the level of messenger RNA and chromatin, triggered by double-stranded RNA. Originally identified in lower organisms, recent results indicate that it also plays a crucial role in mammalian development and cell differentiation. Based on recent evidence that RNA silencing can affect B cell development, and strong indications that its dysregulation contributes to B cell lymphomagenesis, we hypothesize that RNA silencing plays specific roles at various stages of B cell development. The latter is a multi-stage process characterized by a sophisticated ordered interplay of chromosomal loci at which somatic gene rearrangements and mutation occur sequentially, accompanied by phases of cellular proliferation and quiescence and a continuous requirement for survival signals that rescue the cells from apoptosis. Together with the self-renewal capacity of certain mature B cell subsets, some of these features strikingly resemble processes that govern stem cell homeostasis and lineage commitment, known to be prime targets of control by RNA silencing. In the proposed experiments we will introduce targeted mutations into sequential stages of B cell development using Cre/loxP-mediated mutagenesis. Using this approach, we will first investigate the extent to which the RNA silencing machinery is required for proper B cell development and function, including the ability of the cells to execute adaptive immune responses and innate immune functions like antigen presentation to T cells. In the latter context, dendritic cells (DCs) will be included in the analysis. In these experiments we will use a conditional d/cerallele which we have generated, having demonstrated that Dicer is required for RNA silencing in mouse cells. Second, we will investigate whether the RNA silencing machinery is regulated during B cell development, and if so, try to understand the basis of such a control. Finally, we will identify and functionally characterize individual si/miRNAs that are selectively and stage-specifically expressed in B cells and DCs, using bioinformatic target gene predictions as a guide and targeted mutagenesis in mice. Overall, we expect new insights into the control of normal and malignant B cell development and the functional activity of B cells in adaptive and innate immune responses. Given the critical role of B cells in protective immunity, autoimmune diseases and lymphomagenesis, we anticipate this work will have significant medical relevance."
7296,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to define the molecular basis of interactions between neutrophils (PMN) and epithelial cells that serve to regulate the process of PMN migration across the intestinal epithelium. The importance of PMN in epithelial pathophysiology is apparent in a number of inflammatory human diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Key features of these diseases include infiltration of intestinal mucosa by large numbers of PMN resulting in enhanced permeability, altered epithelial intercellular junctions and epithlelial erosion/ulceration. Although the pathologic consequences are well known, the molecular  mechanisms regulating transepithelial migration of PMN are just beginning to be defined. Using a well established in-vitro model of PMN transepithelial migration, we have previously shown that initial adhesive events are dependent on CD11 b/CD18 whereas subsequent transmigration is dependent on CD47 interactions with its cellular receptor SIRP alpha. In this proposal we present strong evidence to support the roles of additional receptor-ligand interactions between PMN and epithelial cells at the level of epithelial intercellular junctions. Our data indicate that these receptor ligand pairs are part of the CTX family of proteins that contains all of the JAM family of proteins. Our working hypothesis is that PMN transmigration across the intestinal epithelium is a multistep process that is dependent on multiple interactions with proteins involved in regulation of intercellular junctions. To this end, we will; 1) define the role of epithelial JAM-C in the process of PMN transepithelial migration in concert with, 2) studies aimed at defining it's function in intestinal epithelial cells. In addition we will; 3) examine the roles of other JAM-like CTX proteins in regulating PMN migration across intestinal epithelia and how inflammatory mediators affect this. Characterization of such events will improve our understanding of the biology of mucosal inflammation and provide ideas for new anti-inflammatory therapies."
7304,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this application is to use a combination of acoustic and behavioral responses to test theories of auditory processing at the mechanical and behavioral levels. A subordinate goal is to relate acoustic responses measured non-invasively in the ear canal to cochlear and middle ear function. The first aim studies the relationships between middle ear and cochlear mechanics using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. Measurements of stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emission (SFOAE) and otoreflectance measurements will be used to predict hearing loss, an improved test of acoustic reflex function will be used to study middle-ear noise sources and no linearity, and time-domain models of middle-ear and cochlear energy transmission will be developed and evaluated based on experimental measurements performed in this application or reported in the literature. The second aim studies the effects of cochlear no linearity on spectral processing using SFOAE stimulus conditions similar to those used in behavioral experiments on simultaneous and non-simultaneous masking and suppression. Specifically, the experiments will address the extent to which SFOAE measurements of peripheral mechanics are able to noninvasive assess the strength of the medial olive-cochlear (MOC) efferent system on outer hair cell function, assess the level dependence of SFOAE fine structure, and account for the performance of normal-hearing listeners and listeners with sensor neural hearing loss in detecting tones in broadband and notched noise. The third aim studies the effects of cochlear no linearity on temporal processing using SFOAE stimulus conditions similar to those used in behavioral experiments on overshoot and amplitude modulation (AM). These experiments will assess the shifts in SFOAEs produced by activation of the MOC system in response to sounds with AM, and will test the extent to which SFOAE measurements can account for measurements of behavioral overshoot in normal listeners and subjects with auditory neuropathy. The results of the proposed experiments will provide useful data and modeling to improve our understanding of the auditory periphery in humans, and may improve our ability to diagnose the magnitude of hearing loss and improve our understanding of the impact of hearing loss on spectral and temporal resolution."
7324,HHS,NSF,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Many AD patients develop sleep/wakecycle disturbances. We propose a randomized controlled clinical trial to carefully evaluate anonpharmacologic approach to these problems. Our specific aims and hypotheses are:1)Efficacy. We plan to compare the short-term efficacy of four treatments for sleep/wake cycle disturbancesin community-dwelling AD patients: 1) Morning bright light treatment (AM LIGHT), 2) Evening bright lighttreatment (PM LIGHT), 3) Morning and Evening bright light treatment (AM&PM LIGHT) and 4) a controltreatment, morning dim light treatment (AM DIM). Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that 4 weeks of either AMLIGHT, PM LIGHT or AM&PM LIGHT treatment will be more efficacious than the AM DIM treatment inconsolidating nighttime sleep as assessed by actigraphy. We do not expect to see overall differences inefficacy between AM LIGHT, PM LIGHT and AM&PM LIGHT.2) Individual Differences in Response (Moderators). We will conduct preliminary  moderator analyses  todetermine in which patients which LIGHT treatment works best. Hypothesis 2: Primary Predictors ofResponse: Response to the LIGHT treatments will depend upon the initial MMSE score. SecondaryPredictor Analyses: We expect that baseline sleep/wake and circadian parameters and age may predictresponse to AM LIGHT versus PM light.3) Effectiveness and Quality of Life. We will determine if bright light therapy is effective in terms ofimprovement in quality of life. Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that any of the three LIGHT treatments will bemore effective than AM DIM in improving quality of life in patients and caregivers.These hypotheses will be tested in a parallel groups design study in community-dwelling AD patients withcaregivers. Specifically, we propose to randomize 120 patient/caregiver dyads into four groups of 30 dyadseach: AM LIGHT, PM LIGHT AM&PM LIGHT or AM DIM. After 4 weeks of treatment (Phase 1) all subjectswill be given bright light for an additional 4 weeks (Phase 2). Outcome will be documented by objectivecircadian activity rhythm parameters and standard sleep/wake measures both assessed by actigraphy."
7332,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genetic epidemiologic design focusing on African Americans or Hispanics is particularly challenging because both groups have experienced recent admixture. Indeed, in the presence of cryptic population structure, case-control association designs can produce false-positive association findings. However, case-control designs have unique advantages that family-based designs cannot replace. Therefore, it is crucial to develop approaches that analyze case-control studies and are immune to the perils of population stratification. At the same time, recent admixture creates strong linkage disequilibrium, providing exciting opportunities for novel disease-mapping approaches. The long-term goal of this research is to develop novel quantitative methods which enable researchers to identify the factors that influence disease risk in admixed or stratified populations. This project aims to develop new methods that improve the robustness and efficiency of casecontrol association studies, with applications to African Americans and Mexican Americans. Bootstrap- and resampling-based procedures will be developed to infer important aspects of an individual's ancestry, using genotype data at linked and unlinked genetic markers (Aim 1). Aim 2 strives to shed light on a long-standing controversy regarding the scope of confounding that is likely to occur in practice. Aim 3 develops an adjustment-based approach which incorporates the estimated individual admixture in a regression model and thereby explicitly controls for confounding due to population stratification. Finally, Aim 4 proposes a linkage-disequilibrium mapping approach. The strengths and limitations of the adjustment approach (Aim 3) and the linkage disequilibrium mapping approach (Aim 4) will be assessed analytically and through simulations. Results from this research will enable investigators to better identify and control for bias due to admixture in population-based case-control studies, and to design new valid and more powerful studies. Genotypic data from various multiethnic studies will be used together with extensive simulation experiments to test and refine the methodology for real-world applications."
7346,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of our research is to determine how signal transduction regulates directed motility and behavior in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. M. xanthus represents an excellent model system to address questions concerning cell-cell signaling and directed movement as cells form multicellular fruiting bodies. M. xanthus fruiting bodies are similar to biofilms formed by Pseudomonas and are of public health interest since biofilms render organisms multidrug resistant. Previously, we have shown that the Frz signal transduction system regulates vegetative swarming and developmental aggregation by controlling the reversal frequency of cells. Our data to date indicate that this pathway has multiple inputs and multiple outputs and, somehow, these are all coordinated. We propose the following specific aims to understand this signaling:  1 - Input signaling -We hypothesize that there are at least two major inputs to the Frz pathway: (i) one occurs through FrzF, the methyltransferase, where controlled methylation activates or inactivates the receptor, FrzCD; (ii) the second principal input to the pathway is proposed to be through FrzB, a second CheW, which may be involved in receptor clustering or alternatively in coupling FrzE to other chemosensory pathways in M. xanthus. We plan experiments to characterize these input pathways.  2 - Output signaling - The Frz system contains four CheY-like receiver domains that together control two different motility systems. We plan to study the pathway output by constructing deletions in these domains. We plan to explore the hypothesis that FrzE signals FrzSCheY to activate S-motility and FrzECheA controls A-motility. FrzS, which is required for S-motility forms a structure at the cell poles that will be characterized.  3 - Regulation - We plan to investigate the regulation of the Frz pathway with an emphasis on how signal feedback occurs. Feedback regulation involves methylation and demethylation of FrzCD, but how it functions is not known. We plan to test several hypotheses as to how this might occur."
7372,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): `The RAG1 protein is part of a multi-functional complex that carries out V(D)J recombination, a programmed DNA rearrangement that is required for development of the immune system in humans. Either alone or in the context of its recombinase partner RAG2, RAG1 encompasses multiple biochemical activities, including DNA binding, DNA cleavage, and ubiquitin ligation. The working hypothesis of this laboratory is that RAGl's integral ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity works with the ubiquitin conjugation machinery to regulate V(D)J recombination and lymphocyte development. This is based on the observations that 1) the zinc binding RING finger domain of RAG1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) in vitro and promotes covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin protein to a specific RAG1 lysine residue, 2) RAG1 is ubiquitylated in intact cells, 3) mutation or deletion of the RING finger in model systems leads to altered protein expression and decreased recombination, and 4) mutation of the RING finger or deletion of the region that is ubiquitylated can lead to severe immune deficiency in human patients. The specific hypothesis of this proposal is that RAG1's RING domain interacts with ubiquitin conjugating (E2) enzymes to promote V(D)J recombination. This hypothesis will be tested through a detailed functional and physical analysis of the interaction between the RAG1 RING finger and various E2 enzymes, followed by functional analysis of V(D)J recombination.    1. Test the prediction that the RAG1-E2 binding interface uses structural elements analogous to other RING-E2 pairs. Two independent methods will be used to identify the binding interface.    2. Test the hypothesis that alterations to the zinc binding RING finger domain change the affinity and specificity of RAG1-E2 binding and E3 activity. Multiple independent methods will be used to analyze mutants at the binding interface.    3. Test the hypothesis that RAG1 ubiquitin ligase activity/ubiquitylation promotes V(D)J recombination in cells and that ubiquitylation modulates RAGl's other biochemical activities in vitro. Mutations that diminish E3 activity will be examined in V(D)J recombination and cleavage asays."
7373,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We are submitting a revision of a new application that took advantage of possibilities suggested by findings that we believe will begin a new research direction for this family of viruses. Alphaviruses are of general interest as they produce disease in animals and humans, and replicate in invertebrates and vertebrates. Synthesis of infectious progeny starts with translation and copying of the infecting genome into a minus strand RNA template. Of note, alphavirus minus strand synthesis ceases by an as yet unknown mechanism at the end of the early phase, ~4 h post-infection (pi). Previous models argued cessation was a virus property, with saturation of host factors or assembly sites, or possibly premature and improper replicase processing playing a role. We now know the host cell activates a latent, antivirus response leading to cessation during the 4 h period after entry. In support of a role for host functions, minus strand cessation did not occur in C7/10 mosquito cells that naturally lack RNase L and form persistent infections or in RNase L knockout (ko) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) that are deficient in this latent endonuclease mediator of the dsRNA-2'-5' oligoA synthetase pathway; reconstitution of RNaseL in ko cells restored cessation. Moreover, BHK cells persistently infected with mutant Sindbis nsP2 replicons also continued minus strand synthesis, unlike wildtype nsP2 replicons. Unexpectedly, in cells lacking RNase L or expressing mutant nsP2 proteins, the Sindbis replication complex (RC) was now transcriptionally shortlived. Thus, RNase L and nsP2 play role(s) in cessation and RC stability. Cessation was normal in PKR ko and wt MEF, eliminating roles for Mx1 and PKR. Four aims are proposed. Aim 1 will map the region of RNase L required for cessation. Aim 2 will use gene microarrays to identify changes in host mRNAs during infection and with cessation. Aim 3 will analyze mutant nsP2 proteins, whose presence in BHK cells led to loss of the same virus replication features as seen in RNase L-/- MEF and Aedes mosquito cells. Aim 4 will probe the molecular basis of the loss (turnover) of Sindbis RC in RNase L deficient and mutant nsP2 cell environments. Together, the results will elucidate the innate response to alphavirus infection and the role of the host RNase L and the viral nsP2 protein in its outcome."
7378,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rac2 is a member of the Rac family of GTPases commonly expressed by cells of hematopoietic origin. Our recent studies suggest that Rac2 mRNA and protein is expressed by pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in a granular pattern within the central perinuclear region, that Rac2 regulates the vascular permeability and enhances the barrier function of normal lungs, that Rac2 is required for increases in pulmonary permeability induced by complement activation, and that endothelial Rac2 expression is regulated by TNF-a. The proposed studies will help to better understand the important roles of this GTPase in lung permeability and inflammation by testing the working hypothesis that Rac2 expressed in endothelial cells modulates fluid flux in healthy lungs and increased vascular permeability in endothelial cell injury by regulating vesicular transport and/or integrity of the endothelial cell borders, and that its activity and expression are modulated during the innate immune response. Aim 1 will determine how Rac2 regulates fluid flux in normal lungs. Extravascular lung water will be measured, the rate of albumin accumulation will be compared in Rac2 deficient and wild type mice, which endothelial cells or other lung parenchymal cells express Rac2 will be evaluated, and whether Rac2 modulates fluid fluxes through changes in the junctional complexes or the vesicular transport system will be determined. Aim 2 will determine how Rac2 is activated during endothelial cell injury. The role of ICAM-1 ligation, reactive oxygen species, and/or deposition of C5b-9 complexes (membrane attack complexes) in initiating Rac2 activation in vivo and in vitro will be examined, as well as the intracellular signaling pathways that lead to Rac2 activation. Aim 3 will determine how TNF-a and other cytokines regulate Rac2. Whether TNF-a, IL-1 and interferon-g all have similar effects on endothelial Rac2 production and activation in vivo and in vitro will be assessed, as well as the role of cytokine-induced signaling pathways. Whether endothelial Rac2 is required for cytokine-induced injury in vivo and in vitro will also be determined. These studies will help to understand the role of endothelial cell Rac2 in enhancing the barrier function and in regulating permeability and other aspects of host defense during injury."
7427,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is a request for a Scientist Development Award for New Minority Faculty (K01) that will enable Dr. Nyborg to continue to develop her programmatic line of research in the prevention of aggressive/violent behaviors in males of African descent. African American males are particularly at risk for negative outcomes. Fifteen percent of youth under the age of 18 are African American, but they are overrepresented in criminal and victimization statistics. Data point to a need for culturally relevant prevention programs that specifically address the psychological well-being of African American males.   Dr. Nyborg's training goals are to (1) further develop her knowledge of creating culturally sensitive interventions for African American youth, (2) acquire knowledge of and experiences with public policy creation, analysis, and advocacy, (3) increase knowledge of and experiences with school based mental health interventions, specifically violence prevention and school-based mental health services, (4)advance her knowledge of scale development, (5) acquire knowledge with regard to qualitative data collection and analysis, and (6) improve her grant and manuscript writing. These training goals will be achieved through (1) the resources available at Brown University, (2) the high quality of mentorship provided through Dr. Anthony Spirito, Dr. Cynthia Garcia Coil, Dr. Marion Orr, Dr. Kenneth Dodge, and the assembled expertise of the consultant team, (3) focused coursework and clinical experiences, and (4) the proposed project. The proposed project extends the natural progression of Dr. Nyborg's research. The project will focus on three related sub-studies with African American adolescent males. First, an adolescent hypermasculinity scale will be developed. Second, the relations among experiences of racism, hypermasculinity, and aggressive behavior will be examined. Third, an intervention development trial will be conducted. The intervention will be designed to teach positive coping strategies in dealing with experiences of racism via anger management, and problem solving skills, as well as activities intended to promote feelings of empowerment (e.g., having prominent African American men speak on their experiences with racism)."
7461,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A clear dependence of structural biology on the crystallization of proteins, nucleic acids, viruses, and other macromolecular complexes has developed, as the vast majority of molecular models are now derived from X-ray crystallography. Crystal growth has come to play a crucial role in the entire enterprise of structure determination in the laboratories of both individual investigators, and in large structural genomics centers. The dependence is particularly acute with regard to the more intractable macromolecules such as membrane proteins and glycoproteins. Current approaches to macromolecular crystallization, while successful in perhaps 40% of cases, have not proven themselves able to successfully address many of the most biologically and medically significant problems. We propose to develop an alternate strategy for the crystallization of macromolecules that does not, like current methods, depend on the optimization of traditional variables such as pH and precipitant concentration, but is based on the hypothesis that many conventional small molecules might establish stabilizing, intermolecular, non covalent crosslinks in crystals, and thereby promote lattice formation. To test the hypothesis, we carried out preliminary experiments encompassing 18,240 crystallization trials using 81 different proteins, and 200 chemical compounds. Statistical analysis of the results demonstrates the validity of the idea. In addition, we have also conducted X-ray diffraction analyses of some of the crystals grown in the experiments. These clearly show incorporation of the conventional molecules into the protein crystal lattices, and they further validate the underlying hypothesis. We propose to extend the investigations to include a broader and more diverse set of proteins, including membrane proteins and macromolecular complexes, an expanded search of conventional and biologically active small molecules, and a wider range of precipitants. The strategy proposed here is essentially orthogonal to current approaches and has an objective of doubling the success rate of today."
7484,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural experiences cause changes in the brain. Some changes represent actual storage of new information, whereas others are changes in the way the brain processes ongoing experience. Deficits or abnormalities in the way the brain responds to experience may contribute to disorders of learning, memory, cognition and brain homeostasis. This research is directed at understanding the molecular, cellular and integrative mechanisms that determine how the brain responds to new experiences.  A key aspect of the research is a strategic focus on the adult zebra finch as a model. Zebra finches are colonial animals and communicate via a number of vocalizations, including learned song. Adults discriminate among individuals based on the songs they hear them singing, and also respond to tape-recorded birdsong. When an isolated bird first encounters the sound of a particular birdsong, the bird adopts a distinct  listening  posture and several things happen in a part of the brain analogous to human auditory cortex (called the auditory lobule). Intracellular signaling enzymes are activated, transcription of various genes goes up, and specific proteins begin to accumulate. Recent results suggest that these changes may underlie a functional shift in the way the brain processes or stores information. If another song is presented when these molecular changes are in full swing, the bird more quickly forms a memory of the second song.   The research goals for the next period are to answer four questions about these phenomena.  1) are the observed molecular correlates actually necessary for learning and memory? We will test this by cannula-directed infusion of pharmacological and antisense  knockdown  agents.   1) What intracellular events mark the onset of the period of enhanced learning? Proteomic techniques (DICE, MALDI-ToF) will be used to compare the auditory lobule from  learning  vs  habituated  birds.  1) What genes are activated during enhanced learning? Here we take advantage of new microarray reagents that are being developed under a sister project, the Songbird Neurogenomics Initiative  1) What neurotransmitter(s) signals trigger the molecular/cellular response in the auditory lobule? In collaboration with Profs. Gold and Sweedler, we will test specific hypotheses using in vivo microdialysis, analytical chemistry and targeted injections of pharmacological agents."
7500,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  AIDS vaccine candidates based on recombinant vectors may ultimately fail to provide adequate protection against HIV-1 in ongoing clinical trials. Live, attenuated vaccines afford more reliable protection in animals, but justifiable concerns about their safety will likely preclude their use in humans for the foreseeable future.  Thus, the search continues for an AIDS vaccine that optimizes both safety and efficacy. One promising approach is the use of lentiviruses that are limited to a single cycle of infection. We have developed a unique system for producing strains of SIV that are limited to one round of infection as a non-replicating vaccine approach. Cells infected with this single-cycle SIV (scSIV) express all of the viral gene products except for Pol and release immature virus particles that cannot complete subsequent rounds of infection. In preliminary studies, rhesus macaques immunized with scSIV made antibody and T cell responses to multiple viral antigens. Following an intravenous challenge with SIVmac239, a strain that is notoriously difficult to protect against by vaccination, these animals also exhibited significant reductions in both acute and chronic phase viral loads relative to unvaccinated control animals. We now propose to more fully evaluate the extent of protection that may be achieved by this novel vaccine approach. In specific aim 1, we will test two different scSIV vaccine regimens to compare the effects of frequency versus dose of inoculation on the development of virus-specific immune responses and the ability to contain infection after a pathogenic SIV challenge. In specific aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the induction of neutralizing antibodies by envelope-modified strains of scSIV can enhance protection. In specific aim 3, we will determine if the site of scSIV immunization influences the mucosal homing properties of virus-specific T cell responses and the ability to protect against a mucosal SIV challenge. Associations between immune responses elicited by scSIV and the outcome of challenge will be analyzed for each specific aim to reveal potential mechanisms of protection."
7531,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic and toxic acute renal failure remain important causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients and greatly increase the expense of care. ATP production in the kidney proximal tubule, a major site of injury during acute renal failure, is especially sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction because, depending on the segment, glycolysis is absent or minimal in proximal tubule cells. When isolated proximal tubules are subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation under conditions relevant to ischemia/reperfusion in vivo, they develop a severe energetic deficit characterized by persistent ATP depletion and impaired recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential during reoxygenation, which plays a pivotal role in tubule cell survival and recovery from the insult. The energetic deficit can be ameliorated by specific, supplemental citric acid cycle metabolites. Work during the current funding period has shown that the deficit cannot be readily explained by abnormalities of mitochondrial electron transport, the adenine nucleotide translocase or the F1FO-ATPase. Instead, it appears to be primarily attributable to mitochondrial de-energization produced by nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA). Lowering NEFA availability restores mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production and is a major mechanism for the benefit provided by the supplemental substrates. To further test this hypothesis and investigate the mechanisms involved and the implications for tubule cell injury, we plan to: 1) Clarify the role of NEFA shuttling on mitochondrial inner membrane anion carriers in the mediation of NEFA-induced dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential. 2) Determine whether UCP2 is involved in the NEFA effects. 3) Assess the NEFA lowering efficacy of agents that restore mitochondrial membrane potential. 4) Quantify the free fatty acid levels mediating dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential. 5) Assess the magnitude of the NEFA- induced proton leak and the role of NEFA in respiratory inhibition. 6) Test whether NEFA-induced dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential accounts for the matrix condensation characteristic of the energetic deficit and whether condensation itself further impairs mitochondrial function. 7) Further investigate the role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and its modification by NEFA in the energetic deficit. 8) Characterize expression of the mitochondrial permeability transition in the tubules, its modification by NEFA, and its contribution to progression of mitochondrial dysfunction. These studies are relevant to understanding and treating ischemic acute renal failure and preserving kidneys and other organs for transplantation and to the basic understanding of the critical role that mitochondria are now recognized to play during both necrotic and apoptotic cell death in all cell types."
7547,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both executive functions in working memory (e.g. attention and response inhibition) and semantic functions are known to be compromised in schizophrenia. The former has been associated with general cognitive deficits, while the latter, more specifically with thought disorder and language use in schizophrenia. Currently, an ongoing debate in the literature pits the organization of the semantic system against executive functions as underlying the language disorganization seen in persons with schizophrenia. However, recent behavioral, physiological and imaging evidence suggests that language deficits, specifically thought disorder, are likely to be a result of interactions between executive processes and the semantic system. Accordingly, the long-term objectives of the proposal are to specify the interactions to the extent that they may be used for Identification of a biological and behavioral system useful for the early diagnosis of schizophrenia, as language abnormalities are often one of the first indicators of the disease. The semantic system interacts with executive processes at sensory, phonemic, word, phrase, sentence, and text levels. These interactions increase in complexity and thereby increase cognitive demands as the context moves from words to text levels. The specific aims of this proposal are to evaluate the interaction of executive and semantic processing during manipulations of contextual complexity, and potentially demonstrate both the relationship between behavioral performance during semantic tasks to other measures of semantic processing and the underlying brain system involved. We will specifically examine the effect of executive processes on semantic retrieval and examine the idea that in schizophrenia the failure of fronto-posterior connectivity, with a resulting compensatory increase in fronto- frontal connectivity, are part of language disorganization. This will be done using recently developed behavioral measures of semantic performance and semantic organization, in tandem with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and modeling to specify the biological system associated with our results. Healthy volunteers, persons with schizophrenia and their relatives will participate. Our behavioral and modeling results will increase the understanding of the mechanisms underlying semantic deficits in schizophrenia, which is of significant concern in the domain of public health, and has the potential to be an early marker of the disease."
7549,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reversible protein phosphorylation is a fundamental posttranslational control mechanism in eukaryotes. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is one of the major classes of Ser/Thr phosphatases with likely thousands of phospho-protein substrates. The predominant form of PP2A is a heterotrimer of catalytic, scaffolding, and variable regulatory subunits. The identity of the regulatory subunit defines substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and regulation of PP2A by second messengers and reversible phosphorylation. The recent crystal structure of one of the several dozen possible PP2A heterotrimers offered a first glimpse into the molecular architecture and regulation of this fascinating enzyme. Still, substrates and physiological functions of specific PP2A heterotrimers remain poorly defined. Here, we propose to characterize two brain-specific PP2A regulatory subunits with relevance to neurodegenerative disorders, B'? and B?2. B'? acts as a gatekeeper in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and catecholamine synthesis. Inhibitors of PP2A enzymes containing this subunit may therefore prove useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). B?2 is derived from a gene mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12). B?2 expression is pro-apoptotic, while B'?  silencing protects neurons against a variety of insults. PP2A/B?2 inhibitors may thus form the basis for novel neuroprotective therapies. The first aim of this application is exploratory in nature, while the remaining two are hypothesis-driven. Aim 1 uses quantitative proteomics to identify interactors and substrates of PP2A/B'? and PP2A/B?2 in stable PC12 cell lines that inducibly express or silence these neuronal regulatory subunits. Aims 2 and 3 investigate how these two neuron-specific PP2A holoenzymes are regulated and how they mediate disease-related substrate dephosphorylation in vitro, in cell culture, and in animal models. Based on recent PP2A hetereotrimer crystal structures, aim 2 examines structural determinants of TH dephosphorylation by B'?, regulation of PP2A/B'? by kinases, and regulation of dopamine synthesis by B'? in vivo. Lastly, aim 3 seeks to define the mechanisms by which B?2 promotes apoptosis. We hypothesize that PP2A/B?2 dephosphorylates and inactivates mitofusin-2, a protein mutated in a common peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A. These studies are significant in that they advance our understanding of the critical regulatory enzyme PP2A with the ultimate goal of better therapies for several neurodegenerative disorders."
7561,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technological innovations arising from the HapMap Project have dramatically increased the speed and accuracy of genotyping while greatly reducing cost. Public and private efforts are beginning to release an unprecedented volume of human genotype and DNA sequence data into the public domain. In order to allow the best inferences about human variation and past human evolution from these data, we propose a series of investigations that center around four aims. First, we will develop novel statistical methods for population genetic inference from high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms. Pyrosequencing technology will generate assembled alignments that represent a sampling of sequence reads across individuals (multinomial) and across homologous chromosomes within an individual (binomial), producing a complex mixture. Inference of population genetic parameters from such data will demand novel statistical approaches, and we outline a set of plans to develop statistically rigorous methods. Second, we will develop methods for reverse-engineer the ascertainment biases of SNPs on widely used genotyping panels so as to enable population genetic inference. SNPs on the high-throughput genotyping platforms of Affymetrix and Illumina were ascertained in diverse and often irretrievable ways. Statistically sound population genetic inference from these data requires an understanding of the nature of the ascertainment bias of these platforms. We will reverse engineer the ascertainment by use of ENCODE and other dense resequence data, and use these inferences to perform ascertainment bias correction to high- density SNP platform data. Third, we will develop novel methods for inference of natural selection from patterns of haplotype diversity within and among human populations and apply these approaches to publicly available data sets. Methods of inference of natural selection from SNP frequency and haplotype diversity continue to gain in power and specificity. Optimization of these methods demands correction for effects of ascertainment, demographic effects, local variation in recombination, and for imputation of missing data and of haplotype phase. We will make use of Markov-Hidden Markov models for jointly estimating the magnitude, location, and age of selection sweeps. Finally, we will develop novel approaches for predicting the functional consequences of nucleotide substitutions in putatively functional regions of the human genome. Whole-genome association tests will gain power and specificity from the use of prior inference of the likelihood that a SNP has a damaging effect on a gene's function. In addition, after genome-wide association tests, there will follow extensive resequencing of candidate regions, and inference of the likelihood of deleterious effects of the many rare variants will also have utility. We propose methods that have advantages over existing approaches, making use of comparative genomic data, protein structure, cis-regulatory information, and patterns of segregating variation.    Project Narrative: This project will develop methods of statistical inference from human DNA resequencing and SNP genotype data that will allow accurate estimation of critical parameters that describe the structure of variation in human populations. These inferences can provide vital clues to identifying genes that are associated with risk of complex genetic disorders."
7570,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In experimental aging studies and other longitudinal studies, it has become increasingly common to observe an event time of interest, called survival time, along with longitudinal covariates measured at several time points. A growing interest in the scientific community is to model both processes simultaneously to explore their relationship and to borrow strength from each component in the model building process.    Such joint modeling approaches have become feasible due to the rapidly improving computing environment. Quite a few innovative approaches have been proposed in the last decade, but they typically involve strong model restrictions. This proposal aims at developing less restrictive alternative models and targets the associated computational and theoretical challenges. We will develop:  1. Nonparametric mixed-effects approach for longitudinal covariates that provide model flexibility;  2. More general survival models and approaches, and model checking tools for the survival component;  3. The method of sieves to alleviate the computational burden and to provide computational stability;  4. User-friendly software including applications of aims 1-3 to aging studies;  5. Additional tools to incorporate non-ignorable censoring and various measurement error structures.    This research is motivated by several aging studies that address the relationship between patterns of reproduction and longevity. It draws tools from a related area called Functional Data Analysis, viewing the observed longitudinal data as scattered realizations of a smooth underlying process, possibly observed with measurement errors. The new approaches will not only shed light on the relationship between life-span and longitudinal markers such as reproductive histories, but will also be broadly applicable to clinical and epidemiological studies. They involve emerging statistical tools that will provide advanced methodology and flexible approaches to model complex biological systems, and will also facilitate model checking."
7581,HHS,NSF,"Cells in the nervous system interact with different extracellular matrix proteins that regulate theirdevelopment through interactions mediated by integrins and other receptors, such as dystroglycan and thesyndecans. Our recent work has implicated integrins and the integrin-associated proteins focal adhesionkinase (Fak) and integrin-linked kinase (Ilk)in organization of neural epithelial cells and radial glia, depositionof the basal lamina on the surface of the developing CMS,control of radial migration of neocortical neurons,formation of axonal and dendritic branching patterns, and responses to netrin-1. Work of others hasindicated that focal adhesion kinase is an important effector through which other axon guidance molecules,such as ephrins and semaphorins, control neuronal development. We will characterize the substrates andsignaling pathways through which these kinases regulate basal lamina assembly. We will seek to identifythe signaling pathways that control radial migration of neurons in the neocortex that are disrupted byabnormal assembly of the basal lamina on the surface of the neural tube. We will also initiate experiments toidentify the downstream effectors of these two protein kinases that are most essential for their functions incontrolling neuronal responses to netrin-1 and in controlling axon branching in response to many factors.We will isolate a fak mutant that will permit rapid and specific inhibition of FAK function in defined subsets ofneurons and use this mutant to determine whether FAK controls axon branching and synapse developmentonly during embryogenesis or also during axonal and synaptic remodeling in adult animals. We will furthercharacterize the role of p190RhoGEF as a mediator of Fak responses using genetic and cell biologicalapproaches. The results should be important in understanding the molecular deficits that result in type IIlissencephaly. They should also contribute to our understanding of the signaling pathways through which animportant family of axon guidance molecules controls axon growth, branching and guidance."
7657,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects over i million individuals in the US. Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is second in occurrence only to Alzheimer's disease. There are presently no treatments for PD or DLB that can halt or reverse the neurodegenerative processes. The RNA interference (RNAi) gene therapy approach in this project has the potential of halting or reversing these diseases. Recent studies suggest a role for a-synuclein (SNCA) in the development of PD and DLB, and other neurodegenerative diseases classified as a-synucleinopathies. Three point mutations in the SNCA gene, as well as triplet SNCA gene repeats, have been linked to familial forms of PD and DLB, revealing both mutant and wild type SNCA as therapeutic targets for these diseases. SNCA is a main components in neuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies, the neuropathological hallmarks of individuals afflicted with PD or DLB. In PD, Lewy bodies are found predominantly in the substantia nigra where the degenerating dopaminergic (DA) neurons reside. In DLB, Lewy bodies are found in many cortical and subcortical structures. Lewy neurites, neuronal processes containing insoluble SNCA protein, are found in both diseases. Insults that lead to death of DA neurons in animal models of PD, including exposure to the pesticide, rotenone, the neurotoxin, MPTP, and drugs that inhibit protein degradation increase SNCA expression and result in SNCA containing Lewy body-like inclusions in DA neurons. Moreover, experimentally increasing expression of human SNCA in a range of laboratory species leads to DA neuronal pathology and functional deterioration. We propose to explore the hypothesis that inhibiting expression of SNCA in DA neurons using a gene therapy approach will prevent DA neurodegeneration. Adeno-associated virus (AAV), the vector of choice for clinical trials will be used in rats in which human SNCA is ectopically expressed in DA neurons leading to DA cell death. The effects of silencing SNCA expression in this model, as well as in an SNCA-dependent cell culture model, will be assessed using morphometry, histology, neurochemistry and behavioral testing. Also, a vector with the silencing construct under control of an inducible promoter will be generated and tested as a possible safety strategy for a clinical gene therapy. The goal of this project is to generate proof-of-principle data supporting the development of clinical trials using a novel RNAi-based gene therapy for individuals afflicted with PD and DLB. ?"
7675,HHS,NSF,"The present proposal aims at investigating the hypothesis that age deficits in working-memory-related tasksare due to executive control demands. The working memory model we adopt is Oberauer's (2002) tripartiteconcentric model, a combination of Cowan's (2001) embedded-process model with McEIree's (2001) focus-of-attention theory. The executive control processes investigated are, first, focus shifting (a process followingdirectly from McEIree's model), and further the four processes identified by Miyake et al. (2001) in aconfirmatory factor analysis as basic control processes: task shifting, updating, resistance to interference,and coordination/integration. These five processes will be manipulated both individually and in combination,in a series of experiments involving three tasks: a modified N-Back task, a Continuous Calculation task, anda Repetition Detection task; both accuracy and latency will be measured. For the two former tasks, we willalso collect response time distributions, which will be analyzed using ex-Gaussian decomposition.The main questions of the proposal are:1. With regard to cognitive theory: whether or not the five proposed main executive control functions can bedissociated from each other, using as dissociation tools (a) the selective influence of these processes ondistinct parameters of the ex-Gaussian distribution (where applicable); and (b) the selective influence of ageon accuracy, reaction time, or distinct parameters of the ex-Gaussian distribution;2. With regard to cognitive theory: how these five control functions combine (in an additive fashion, withunderadditivity, or with overadditivity); examined at the level of (a) log(accuracy), (a) reaction time, and (c)the distinct parameters of the ex-Gaussian distribution;3. With regard to aging theory: whether or not each of these control functions are age-sensitive with regardto accuracy, reaction time, or distinct parameters of the ex-Gaussian distribution (where applicable), andwhether or not the combination of these processes leads to increased age-sensitivity;4. With regard to aging theory: whether or not the capacity of the zone of direct access of working memory(Cowan, 2001; McEIree, 2001; Oberauer, 2002) changes with age."
7680,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the dominant role of R5 viruses in HIV-1 transmission and early infection, in about 50% of patients, X4 viruses emerge late in infection, coincident with the decline in circulating CD4+ T cells and precedes the onset of AIDS. Infections of rhesus macaques with X4-specific SHIVSF33A and R5-specific SHIVSF162P3 were performed to address the underlying basis for the apparent preferential transmission and early infection of R5 viruses. Data showed that there is no intrinsic barrier to the transmission and dissemination of X4-SHIVsF33A, but that R5-SHIVSF162P3 dominated shortly after infection. Administration of anti-CD8 antibodies at the time of R5 dominance resulted in the emergence of the X4- SHIVSF33A, suggesting that the X4 virus is more susceptible to CD8+ T cell mediated immune control. A hypothesis/model, based on the premise of target cell competition, is proposed in which preferential infection and replication of R5-SHIVSF162P3 in tissue macrophages explains for its dominance in the dually-infected macaques. Several questions/issues arose as a result of these findings in the co-infected macaques and the model proposed, and form the basis of the present continuation grant application. First, although we favor CoR usage as the determining factor for R5-SHIVSF162P3 dominance, it is conceivable that the reduced fitness and inherent susceptibility to immune control of X4-SHIVSF33A in the dually infected macaques are due to other factors in the virus genetic background. V3 loop isogenic viruses that differ in CoR usage therefore will be used for infection of macaques to further define the influence of viral tropism on pathogenesis and viral dominance in vivo (Specific Aim #1). Second, to test our hypothesis which is based on differential macrophage tropism, we propose to characterize the cells producing X4-SHIVSF33A and R5-SHIVSF162P3 during the course of infection in singly as well as dually infected macaques (Specific Aim #2). Of particular interest will be the identification of the virus populations residing in the macrophage and T cell pools of dually infected macaques. Third, the nature of the CD8+ T cell mediated response responsible for virus suppression in the X4- and R5-SHIV infected animals is not known. This is particularly pertinent in light of the fact that the infected animals undergo a rapid, profound loss of CD4+ T cells, raising questions as to the functionality of their CD8+ T cells. Thus, in Specific Aim # 3, we propose to examine and compare the development, maintenance and effectiveness of CD8+ T cell response elicited in X4-, R5- and dually-infected macaques that suffer rapid and severe loss of different CD4+ T cell subpopulations. Lastly, the question of whether the use of anti-viral agents directed at the CCR5 coreceptor in vivo would facilitate the selection of X4-utilizing viruses remains unresolved. The dual infection animal model described here provides a unique opportunity to evaluate whether administration of CCR5 inhibitors at the time of R5 dominance will lead to the re-emergence of the X4 virus (Specific Aim #4)."
7682,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapy drug and a nephrotoxin. The studies funded by this grant have revealed that the enzyme gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is essential for the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin, but induces resistance to cisplatin in rapidly growing tumor cells. These data have led to the discovery that cisplatin is metabolized to a nephrotoxin via a platinum-glutathione conjugate. This is the first demonstration that cisplatin can undergo enzymatic activation to a metabolite that is more toxic than the parent compound. Our hypothesis is that cisplatin kills the non-dividing cells in the kidney by a mechanism that is distinct from the mechanism by which it kills the dividing tumor cells. This renewal application has three specific aims. The first is to identify the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) that catalyze the formation of the nephrotoxic platinum-GSH conjugate of cisplatin. An HPLC assay will be used to identify and monitor the purification of GSTs that catalyze the formation of the nephrotoxic platinum-GSH conjugate. A combination of siRNA and transfection studies will be done to confirm the role of the GST in cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Expression of GSTs in tumors has been associated with resistance to cisplatin. The resistance may be due to their ability to serve as a binding protein. GSTs that bind cisplatin will also be identified. The second specific aim is to identify the renal enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of the platinum-cysteine conjugate to a toxin. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that a pyridoxal 5'- phosphate-dependent enzyme catalyzes this reaction. The third specific aim is to identify the mechanism by which the sodium stress response blocks cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Sodium chloride is used clinically to reduce cisplatin nephrotoxicity. The mechanism of this protective effect is not known. A cell culture system will be used to investigate the molecular basis of this response. Tumor cells will be analyzed to determine if the sodium stress response is constitutively expressed in cisplatin-resistant cells. Cisplatin is one of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs. The goal of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which cisplatin kills cells and the mechanism by which cells become resistant to cisplatin."
7732,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our laboratory is to understand changes in gene expression and regulation that occur during insulin resistance and diabetes which permit excessive SMC activation. We recently reported that overexpression of the cAMP Response Element Binding Protein (CREB) transcription factor decreases SMC migration and proliferation. One of the genes downregulated by CREB expression likely to mediate a decrease SMC proliferation is the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRa) gene. Animal studies demonstrate the PDFGRa expression is increased in the vessel wall in diabetes and insulin resistance (models where CREB content is decreased). The goals of the current proposal are to clarify molecular details of how changes in CREB and C/EBP delta in diabetes and insulin resistance affect gene expression using the PDGFRa as a model target gene. HYPOTHESIS: Loss of vascular CREB function and augmented C/EBPdelta function in diabetes promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation, in part, by increasing expression of PDGFRa. Manipulation of vascular CREB function will impact proliferative capacity and development of atherosclerosis. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To determine the impact of targeted vascular overexpression of active and inactive CREB on gene expression, mitogenic capacity and atherosclerosis, a. To examine SMC proliferation and PDFGRa expression in transgenic mice with vascular specific expression of CREB and dominant negative CREB (A-CREB). b To test the hypothesis that loss of CREB contributes to atherosclerotic burden using inducible expression of active and inactive CREB on an ApoE null background. 2. To employ the promoter of the PDGFRa gene as a model to define the regions/cis-acting elements in that are responsive to regulation through CREB and C/EBPdelta. a. Mutagenesis and Footprinting studies of the PDGFRa promoter, b. Confirm CREB and C/EBPdelta DNA binding using EMSA and Affinity purification, c. Identify in vivo occupancy using ChIP analysis of relevant CREB and C/EBP binding elements, d. Determine how PDGFRa expression is affected by changing concentrations and activation states of CREB and C/EBPdelta. 3. To determine whether PPARa mediated suppression of PDGFRa gene expression works through CREB and C/EBPs."
7743,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The objectives are to understand why the lupus immune system responds abnormally to nucleosomes, the major products of physiologically programmed apoptosis, and how can such autoimmune responses be specifically down-regulated? Identification of the dominant epitopes in nucleosomes critical for cognate interactions between autoimmune T helper (Th) cells and anti-DNA B cells of lupus provided us the essential tools for two novel discoveries leading to the proposed experiments. 1). It is widely believed that negative selection is intact in lupus. We have now found that the thymuses of lupus-prone mice are unable to delete transgenic thymocytes bearing nucleosome-specific T-cell receptor (TCR), although central tolerance for other antigens is intact. For the first time, mechanism/s of this peculiarly selective defect in central tolerance for nucleosomes in the lupus-prone thymus will be defined using new lines of TCR-transgenic mice we have generated. Mice of normal backgrounds bearing the transgenes will be studied first to define mechanism/s of negative selection of T cells specific for nucleosomes, the major products of ongoing apoptosis in the thymus, and to define the spectrum of negatively selecting epitopes. Novel mechanisms of peripheral tolerance in these new transgenic mice bearing lupus TCR will also be studied, particularly a functional uncoupling of signaling by autoimmune TCR from full T cell activation.    2). We have found that therapeutic tolerance with very low doses of select nucleosomal peptides can down-regulate active lupus by unique mechanisms. The critical epitopes that are recognized in MHC unrestricted manner by pathogenic autoantibody-inducing Th cells of lupus are also recognized by autoimmune B cells, and such shared epitopes are potent tolerogens for therapy. We will determine how pathogenic autoantibody inducing help is impaired by very low-dose vs. high-dose tolerance therapy with the nucleosomal peptide epitope/s we have identified, a). Role of anergy or deletion of lupus T and B cells; b). role of long-lasting regulatory (suppressor) T cell subsets with unique markers that are generated by peptide therapy; and c). the roles of tolerogenic dendritic cells and B cells in the generation of unusual regulatory T cells will be defined. The studies will address fundamental questions regarding autoimmunity and tolerance to an ubiquitous product of apoptosis, and would help in developing antigen-specific therapy of lupus."
7751,HHS,HHS,"Angiotensin ll-infused rats exhibit increases in renal angiotensinogen (AGT) mRNA and protein, and this maybe one mechanism by which low levels of circulating angiotensin II induce progressive hypertension. Using aninteresting transgenic mouse model in which human AGT is expressed only in the kidney, it is possible toenhance angiotensin II content only in the kidney without altering circulating levels of angiotensin II. The goalof this research project is to define and characterize the mechanisms responsible for the intrarenalenhancement of AGT expression by angiotensin II. My hypothesis is that the augmented intrarenal AGTexpression by angiotensin II involves angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor-dependent and c-Src/MAPK-,ROS-, or Rho-kinase/NFkB-dependent pathways. In accord with this hypothesis, the following specific aimsare targeted for the proposed period of support: 1) To demonstrate that chronic overproduction of angiotensinII only in the kidney elicited by stimulating human AGT expression in the presence of human renin will causeincreases in endogenous mouse AGT mRNA expression as well as endogenous mouse AGT protein levels inproximal tubular cells leading to slowly progressive hypertension in gene-targeted male mice. 2) Todemonstrate that subacute overproduction of angiotensin II only in the kidney elicited by stimulating humanAGT expression in the presence of human renin will cause increases in endogenous mouse AGT mRNAexpression as well as endogenous mouse AGT protein levels in proximal tubular cells leading to progressivehypertension in gene-targeted female mice. 3) To demonstrate that the enhancement of the endogenousmouse AGT production in proximal tubular cells involves AT1 receptor-mediated mechanisms in gene-targeted female mice. 4) To determine if AT1 receptor-dependent AGT enhancement by angiotensin IIinvolves c-Src/MAPK-, ROS-, or Rho-kinase/NFkB-dependent mechanisms in primary-cultured mouseproximal tubular cells. 5) To examine whether the 5'-upstream promoter region of mouse AGT gene haspositive responsive element(s) by angiotensin II. The results obtained from the proposed studies will provideimportant information regarding the intrarenal augmentation of AGT expression by angiotensin II, which mayhelp to develop a novel concept to treat angiotensin ll-dependent hypertensive subjects and to establish theimportance of the tubular renin-angiotensin system in the genesis of angiotensin ll-dependent hypertension."
7756,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer is common in the United States and is bnmkjrelatively understudied relative to its public health implications. This project seeks to understand how the epigenetic silencing of apoptotic genes by abnormal methylation of cytosine residues occurs as a function of age and carcinogenesis. We have discovered that we can use the quantitative MethyLight high throughput platform to detect DNA methylation changes in urine sediments, which gives us unique opportunities to study cancer evolution and progression in a longitudinal fashion using a noninvasive sampling technique. We wish to take advantage of the availability of urine sediments to translate our basic science discoveries into strategies which can assist in the identification of recurrent tumors. Since recurrence is a common feature of superficial bladder cancer, the achievements of these goals would have profound impact on the patient's quality of life. To achieve these goals we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will complete the development of a marker panel of CpG islands located upstream and just downstream of the transcription start sites of apoptotic genes and verify that methylation observed in urine sediments corresponds with methylation in the primary tumors. Secondly, we will take advantage of the urine sediment system to ascertain how DNA methylation patterns evolve in the urinary bladder as a function of aging. Thirdly, we will conduct consecutive studies on patients who have been surgically treated for either superficial or invasive bladder cancer to determine whether the methylation patterns present at the time of initial surgical excision reappear in the urine sediments before the recurrent tumors can be detected by conventional means. Thus, the achievement of these three specific aims will allow us not only to understand the epigenetics of bladder cancer but also use these fundamental discoveries to better the lives of patients with this disease."
7783,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This project will develop and distribute software for mouse colony management and the tracking and analysis of data associated with mouse colonies. The centerpiece of this proposal is an existing mouse colony management system (MTS). MTS was developed by researchers at The Jackson Laboratory (TJL) and it leverages extensive expertise in mouse colony management and database development. This product has received extensive use internally. This proposal focuses on extending the current capabilities of MTS and the development of a robust software product for wider distribution. Analytic software tools for QTL analysis and breeding simulation analysis will be developed in parallel as loosely integrated enhancements to MTS. In addition, we propose to develop MTS in coordination with the MutaJax project. MutaJax is a workflow management system that was developed under the auspices of the mutagenesis programs at TJL. Coordination of these projects will ensure that MTS is non-redundant with existing workflow software tools and that it will be scalable as a component of a comprehensive  enterprise  workflow system. The software development group at TJL operates under a highly disciplined system development process that will ensure the production of robust and well-documented software products."
7834,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the growing number of available agents designed to retard cancer growth, alkylating agents remain an important mainstay of cancer therapeutics. However, effective modulation of existing agents is necessary both to improve efficacy and to attenuate toxicity. Of the clinically useful alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are widely used for a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies and are thus important targets for manipulation. Major clinical toxicities include urotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and, to a lesser extent, a risk of secondary leukemias. An important issue that has been raised, but not addressed directly, is the possibility that the DNA repair protein, O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT), protects against toxicities associated with ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide. Specific aims 1 and 2 will establish if MGMT plays a role in protecting against secondary leukemia by evaluating the repair of DNA adducts introduced by cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide by MGMT. Initially, we will determine if acrolein creates toxic/mutagenic lesions on DNA that are repaired by MGMT. These studies will be extended to the Nfl+/- mouse model of cyclophosphamide-induced leukemia. Shannon and colleagues have shown that mice heterozygous for the Nf1 gene, which encodes for a GTPase activating protein of Ras, have a higher incidence of leukemia at 15 months of age after treatment with cyclophosphamide than wild type mice. The NF1+/- mouse model of alkylating agent-induced leukemia will be crossed with MGMT-/- mice to determine if the absence of MGMT (Nfl+/-, MGMT-/-) results in an increase in the incidence of leukemia after treatment with cyclophosphamide as compared to littermates wild type for MGMT (Nf1+/-, MGMT+/+). Specific aim 3 will focus on modulating the antitumor effect of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide without increasing toxicities associated with acrolein or chloracetaldehyde (CAA). We have identified substituted guanine analogs that increase the sensitivity of human cancer cells to phosphoramide mustard (PM), isophosphoramide mustard (IPM) but not CAA or acrolein. We will determine if the mechanism of enhancement is due to inhibition of repair of crosslinks. In this renewal, we will continue to work towards our long-term goal of developing means to protect against the toxic and mutagenic effects of alkylating agents."
7835,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both heart failure and chronic renal disease induces a state of neurohormonal activation that hastens their progression. Central to these pathophysiologies is the activation of the Renin-Angiotensin system and aldosterone production. Aldosterone production is Ca 2+ dependent and alH low-voltage-activated (LVA), T-type, Ca 2+ channels are the major carriers of Ca 2+ current in the aldosterone producing cell of the zona glomerulosa (AG). Our laboratory has identified the intracellular loop connecting transmembrane domains II and III (II-III loop) on alpha1H channels as an important center for signal integration. CaMKII phosphorylates S1198 to induce a hyperpolarizing shift in the half-activation potential for gating, and GBbeta2ggamma2binds with high-affinity and inhibits aIpha1H channel activity voltage independently. We test the hypothesis that during cell activation the II-III loop recruits these signaling molecules selectively and with high-affinity and thus enables reciprocal channel regulation to contribute functionally to the physiologically actions of Ang II and dopamine, two hormones that exert strong counter-regulatory control of aldosterone production. We use tools of molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology and electrophysiology to test this hypothesis in the following specific aims: Aim 1: Specifically we will: (1.1) identify the residues on the alpha1H II-III loop that mediate high affinity CaMKII binding, (1.2) determine if this binding dynamically localizes the kinase to the channel during cell stimulation, (1.3) introduce peptides or CaMKII-regulation resistant channels to adrenal zona glomerulosa cells to perturb channel regulation and evaluate the stimulation of aldosterone secretion by Ang II. Aim 2: Specifically we will: (2.1) identify the critical residues on GBeta2 subunits that mediate inhibition of alpha1H whole-cell channel activity and alpha1H  II-III loop binding, (2.2) establish if Gbeta2 subunits inhibit ohH channels in the excised patch, (2.3) use RNAi and viral-mediated delivery of channel regulation-deficient Gbeta subunits to cells of the adrenal zona glomerulosa to disrupt channel regulation and evaluate the inhibition of aldosterone secretion by dopamine."
7888,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The SCF ubiquitin ligase pathway employs cullin proteins to assemble substrate specificity modules and ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, thereby promoting substrate ubiquitination. Our recent work has revealed that cullin-3 (Cul3) binds a large family of BTB-domain proteins in a manner analogous to the Skpl/F-box complex, which binds Cull. We hypothesize that BTB proteins function as substrate specific adaptors for Cul3. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from our finding that the C. elegans BTB protein Mel-26 interacts with its genetically defined target Mei-1 through its MATH domain. Elimination of Mei-1 protein that accompanies exit from meiosis depends upon Mel-26, Cul-3, and the cullin activator Nedd8, suggesting that the Cul3/Mel-26 complex functions as a ubiquitin ligase to facilitate Mei-1 destruction during this cell cycle transition. In addition, we have recently found that Keap1, which interacts through its BTB domain with Cul3 and through its kelch domain with the transcription factor Nrf2, is required for degradation of Nrf2 in vivo and ubiqutination of Nrf2 in vitro. Here, we seek to further establish the role of BTB proteins in targeted ubiquitintation. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the biochemical requirements for target ubiquitination by two Cul3-based ubiquitin ligases, Mel-26/Cul3 and Keap1/Cul3, and will examine the role of BTB-protein dimerization in ubiquitination activity in vitro and protein turnover in vivo. In aim 2, we will extend our structural analysis of E3s by examining the architecture of the Cul-3/Mel-26/Mei-1 complex through crystallographic and biochemical studies. In aim 3, we will employ newly developed RNAi libraries against BTB proteins to define the role of Cul3/BTB complexes in cell division and monomeric cyclin E turnover. In addition, novel approaches for the identification of ubiquitination targets employing loss-of-function genetics and applicable to genome-wide screens will be developed in the context of the BTB/Cul3 pathway. These experiments will: confirm and extend the hypothesis that BTB proteins function as substrate specific adaptors of Cul3, will reveal the structural basis for Cul-3 and substrate recognition by the Mel-26 BTB protein, and will apply the power of functional genomic approaches to the problem of ubiquitin ligase function and target identification in human cells."
7924,HHS,HHS,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an excitatory neurotransmitter in brain, is animportant site of action of ethanol. Chronic ethanol treatment in vivo and in vitro upregulates theNMDA receptor number and function, with a concomitant increase in R1 and R2B polypeptide levelsin vitro. An upregulation of R2B polypeptide levels following chronic ethanol treatment in vivo is dueto an increase in R2B mRNA levels by ~ 40% in cerebral cortex and by ~ 30% in hippocampus.Similar increase in R2B mRNA levels is seen to occur in vitro in cultured fetal cortical neurons. Themolecular mechanism underlying an increase in R2B mRNA levels in response to chronic ethanoltreatment is an increase in NMDA R2B gene transcription rate (Kumari and Ticku, 1998). Theimportance of NMDA R2B receptor subunit in alcohol mediated changes in the brain lies in the factthat ethanol's effect on R2B subunit is seen to occur both in adult and fetal tissue and the intensity ofalcohol's effect is same in both instances. Long term plans of this project are to (i) identify ifalternative promoters are utilized in adult and fetal tissues; (ii) examine the role of methylation inR2B gene expression; (iii) identify ethanol-responsive c/s-controlling regulatory elements in thepromoter region of the R2B gene by deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive analysis; (iv) identify minimal c/s-acting DNA sequences  that are sufficient to show response to ethanol's action bydeletion transfection analysis; (v) identify nuclear protein factor(s) that may interact with minimal c/s-acting DNA sequences to alter R2B gene expression and to prec/sely map how many nucleotideswithin minimal c/s-acting DNA sequences are sufficient for the binding of nuclear factors identifiedabove, and lastly (vi) determine if ethanol mediated increase in intracellular calcium activatesspecific signal pathways that lead to phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element bindingprotein which in turn, binds to cyclic AMP response element in the 5' flanking region of the R2B generesulting in an increase in R2B gene transcription rate. We propose to utilize mouse fetal corticalneurons to achieve these goals as during the first 7 days in culture, fetal cortical neurons expressmainly R2B subunit. A more through understanding of the pertinent molecular mechanisms throughwhich ethanol alters rate of NMDA R2B gene transcription may permit the design of noveltherapeutic approaches to alcohol-related diseases."
7938,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in American men because of the eventual failure of androgen deprivation therapy. Mechanisms underlying progression to the hormone refractory stage have not been completely elucidated, but current evidence suggests that activation of the androgen receptor (AR) in the low androgen environment may play a critical role in this process. Our goal is to understand the regulation of AR signaling by tyrosine kinases. Our studies focused on two kinases, HER-2 and Ack1 (activated cdc42-associated kinase). Activation of HER-2 by the ligand heregulin increases AR transactivation and cell proliferation and leads to recruitment of AR to the androgen responsive enhancer. Inhibition of HER-2 impairs AR transcriptional function by decreasing recruitment of AR to the androgen responsive enhancer. New evidence indicates that activated Ack1 promotes androgen-independent progression of prostate cancer through its ability to activate AR transcriptional function and phosphorylation of AR protein. We now demonstrate that Ack1 phosphorylates AR at Tyr-267 and -363 residues. AR is phosphorylated by heregulin-dependent HER-2 activation and Ack1 may be a downstream mediator of HER-2 in AR phosphorylation. The clinical relevance of this pathway is apparent from our finding that phosphorylated AR and activated Ack1 are found together in primary androgen-independent prostate tumor tissue specimens. The main objective of this proposal is to characterize the mechanisms by which HER-2 and Ack1 tyrosine kinases regulate AR function. Our central working hypothesis is that HER-2 and Ack1 signaling regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the AR protein, leading to alterations in the assembly of the AR transcriptional complex and modulation of AR-dependent transcription. To test our hypothesis, we will concentrate on following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize the effect of HER-2 signaling on assembly of the AR transcription complex. In Aim 2, we will characterize the mechanisms by which Ack1 enhances AR transcriptional activity. In Aim 3, we will characterize the functional significance of AR tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Preliminary studies supporting this proposal led to the initiation of a clinical protocol testing the concept that HER-2 kinase inhibition may be a useful therapeutic approach in prostate cancer. This proposal has the potential to yield fundamental information about prostate cancer biology and mechanisms of AR regulation by cytoplasmic signaling pathways and contribute to development of novel targeted therapy for prostate cancer."
7951,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad purpose of the research in this proposal is to understand how microenvironments (secondary coordination spheres) about metal ions control function. A bio-inspired synthetic approach is utilized that incorporates principles of molecular architecture found in the active sites of metalloproteins. Multidentate ligands will be developed that create rigid organic structures around metal ions. These ligands place hydrogen bond (H-bond) donors or acceptors proximal to the metal centers, forming specific microenvironments. One distinguishing attribute of these systems is that site-specific modulations in structure can be readily accomplished, in order to evaluate correlations with reactivity. A focus of this research is consideration of dioxygen binding and activation by metal complexes - processes linked directly to the maintenance of human health and aging. Long-term goals include developing structure function relationships in metal-assisted oxidative catalysis. Metalloproteins perform functions not yet achieved in synthetic systems. Our hypothesis is that the lack of control of the secondary coordination sphere in synthetic compounds is a major obstacle to desire functions. Results from structural biology show that H-bonds within the secondary coordination spheres of metalloproteins are instrumental in regulating function. Therefore the function and dysfunction of health-related metalloproteins can be understood in the context of changes in their microenvironments. It is still unclear, even in biomolecules, how non-covalent interactions are able to influence metal-mediated processes. Investigations into these effects require basic reactivity and mechanistic studies in which the effects of single components can be analyzed individually. We have developed synthetic H-bonding systems whereby control of the molecular components that define the structure around the metal ion is obtained; in turn, this permits the formation of systems whose activity can be tailored to a particular function. This ability to regulate the microenvironment allows for systematic studies into structure-function relationships that lead to fundamental understanding of chemical processes. Ultimately, this research will provide insights into the properties of biological catalysts and lead to new classes of synthetic catalysts that incorporate the exquisite control of reactivity characteristic of metalloenzymes."
7966,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is recommended for colorectal cancer screening as well as the diagnosis and treatment of various gastrointestinal diseases. It is one of the most common ambulatory care procedures, with estimates of over 14 million procedures in 20002. It is also technically complex, and colonoscopy quality and outcomes may be quite variable. Given its widespread application and high costs, understanding the quality and outcomes of colonoscopy as applied in routine clinical practice is vital. Use of administrative data to measure health care quality is attractive, but the validity of administrative data for routine measures that might indicate quality is not established. This proposal provides important methodological first steps towards using administrative data to measure colonoscopy quality. In our first specific aim, we will obtain colonoscopy reports from medical records of a diverse group of providers to use to determine the accuracy of administrative claims for colonoscopy. These reports will be linked to colonoscopy claims in the Medicare claims database. We will examine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the claims for a variety of important colonoscopy quality indicators, including incomplete colonoscopy, detection rates for colon polyps or cancers, and use of biopsy or polypectomy. Developing an algorithm to determine colonoscopy indication from administrative data is another important methological step towards using such data in quality measurement. For example, the rate of polyp or cancer detection may be different in patients undergoing this procedure for colorectal cancer screening, as compared to patients who clinical signs or symptoms. The ability to examine quality measures in administrative data is therefore dependent upon understanding colonoscopy outcomes. In our second and third specific aims, we will develop and test an algorithm to determine colonoscopy indications from claims data. In an initial, training subset of our database, we will examine the diagnostic and procedure codes associated with the colonoscopy claim as well as codes from prior claims to find individual codes or patterns of coding that predict colonoscopy outcome. The various algorithms we develop will be tested in a second, validation subset of our database to find the algorithm with optimal performance characteristics."
7998,HHS,NSF,"Development of versatile molecular-size machine systemswill be the cornerstone of future technologiesin biology and medicine. The goal of this project is to develop the first practical nanomachine design byintegrating an active biological molecule of a molecular motor protein with artificially engineered components.The construct will be a molecular-size machine belonging to a new class of semi-artificialnanodevices,which we recently introduced. It will perform super-fast labeling of specific DMAbreaks via covalentattachment of fluorescent markers. After self-assembly, the machine will use its own material to fabricatetwo detector units. In the presence of blunt-ended DNA breaks of DNase I type (bearing 5' PO4) or DNase IItype (bearing 5' OH), the detector units will selectively attach to their target DNA ends and will label themwith either red or green fluorophores. The described construct will be the first nanosensor detecting twotypes of specific DNA breaks in fixed tissue sections and a super-fast sensor detecting DNA damage andapoptosis in live non-fixed cells within seconds.

8075,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nuclear receptors program many endocrine processes essential for health and life. Among the most enigmatic are those receptors, which are critically important but have unknown regulating hormones, such as DAX-1, LRH-1 and SF-1. These are the targets of this proposal. Medical disorders teach us about the interplay of these receptors in the endocrine system without telling us their mechanisms. The DAX-1 gene codes an unusual nuclear receptor lacking a DNA interaction domain. Yet it controls the activity of many target genes in many tissues. Mutations in DAX-1 affect embryonic stem cell progression, development of the adrenal and pituitary glands, the hypothalamus and the ovaries or testes leading to severe endocrine disorders. The receptors LRH-1 and SF-1 are critical in developmental processes, and their constitutive activation is muted by DAX-1. These three nuclear receptors and transcription factors are called orphans because their controlling hormones, if they exist, have not been identified. The most basic details of the mechanisms of regulation of these related nuclear receptors are not known.     The goal of this proposal is to understand the principles and atomic level details of the mechanisms of regulation of LRH-1 and SF-1 by DAX-1. Since it halts transcriptional activation, DAX-1 may be classed as a co-repressor with unknown hormone. Because regulation by DAX-1 depends on the associations of these proteins we will analyze, at atomic resolution, the binding interactions of DAX-1 with LRH-1 and SF-1. DAX-1 protein, which has never been prepared in a functionally active state for either biochemical or structural studies, will be isolated and crystallized with LRH-1 and SF-1 so that three-dimensional structures of the assemblies may be analyzed. Functional studies guided by the structural models will carried out in cells to reveal the mechanisms of action of these receptors. This information will be the foundation for understanding the molecular pathology of numerous human endocrine syndromes and suggest pathways for therapeutic intervention.     The nuclear receptors we are studying are associated with many disease processes, including cancer, infertility, genetic metabolic diseases, and mental health defects. Learning the mechanisms of action of these receptors, and what goes wrong in the diseases, will help suggest pathways for design of new drug treatments for these conditions. Project Narrative     The nuclear receptors we are studying are associated with many disease processes, including cancer, infertility, genetic metabolic diseases, and mental health defects.

8076,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allelic and isotypic (haplotype) exclusion establishes that each B cell expresses only one immunoglobulin heavy and light chain pair and, consequently, exhibits a single specificity. Nevertheless, B cells expressing either two heavy or two light chains (haplotype-included) exist in healthy individuals and wild-type mice at a frequency estimated to be approximately 2-10% of the B cell population. Analyses of immunoglobulin transgenic mice have demonstrated that autoreactive B cells can sometimes bypass mechanisms of central tolerance by co-expressing non-autoreactive antigen receptors. These haplotype-included cells co-express autoreactive and non-autoreactive antigen receptors and are found in the mature B cell population. Because the majority of primary immunoglobulin gene rearrangements encode autoreactive specificities, we propose that wild-type haplotype-included B cells have higher chances of being autoreactive than haplotype-included (single Ab-expressing) B cells. The goal of this proposal is to understand the nature and regulation of haplotype-included B cells in mice and to determine if these cells are associated with autoimmunity. To accomplish this we outline three Specific Aims that will characterize dual immunoglobulin light chain- expressing B cells in mice with a wild-type antibody repertoire, determine whether these B cells contribute to the autoimmune process of autoimmune-prone mice, and understand how haplotype- included B cells are physiologically regulated. Haplotype-included autoreactive B cells will be evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using various mouse models and a variety of techniques that include the generation and characterization of B cell hybridomas and the use of cell adoptive transfer. Because autoimmunity is a significant health issue that has multiple, as of yet, poorly understood etiological bases, a molecular and cellular analysis of haplotype-included B lymphocytes is warranted. In particular, we predict haplotype-included B cells to be unique in that the autoantibody they express have the potential to exhibit a high avidity interaction with autoantigen and produce antibodies that simultaneously bind foreign as well as self-antigens.    Project Narrative: Systemic autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis are complex disorders caused by defects in B and other blood cell types and that continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality. Although significant knowledge on these conditions has been achieved, substantial work remains to be done to fully understand the etiology and pathogenesis of these diseases. Some B cells in autoimmunity secrete autoantibodies that bind to molecules produced by the organism. It is still vastly unclear why these cells are generated and why they are activated to secrete autoantibodies. Our studies aim at characterizing a small population of B cells in mice that express two types of antibodies to determine whether these cells are progenitors of autoantibody-secreting cells and pathogenic players of autoimmunity."
8079,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurotransmitters and hormones are released by Ca2+triggered exocytosis, whereby a vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane of a cell and expels its content into the extracellular space. This project has focused on the fusion pore, the initial fluidic passage between the vesicle interior and the outside of a cell. Studies of the fusion pore have given us valuable insights into the mechanism of exocytosis and the roles of specific molecules in the regulation of membrane fusion. The previous funding cycle achieved many of the proposed specific aims, including identification of some of the fusion pore-forming proteins, the elucidation of key kinetic steps in the formation and dilation of fusion pores, and the elucidation of the roles of proteins in those steps. The present proposal follows up on these advances with studies to identify additional proteins in fusion pores and to compare the molecular composition of different classes of fusion pores. Furthermore, the scope of this project will be expanded to the study of fusion pores in synapses. Parallel studies of fusion pore manipulations between the PC12 cell model system and neurons from the brain will define how fusion pore function influences the speed of neurotransmitter release at synapses. Additional experiments are proposed to follow up on advances in understanding the role of a major protein complex (the SNARE complex) in driving membrane fusion."
8095,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Myeloma is characterized by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow and is accompanied by severe bone disease.  Myeloma afflicts more than 14,000 people in the US each year; despite advances in treatment, myeloma remains incurable, highlighting the importance of developing novel interventions for this disease. We demonstrated the interdependence between myeloma bone disease and tumor progression.  Therefore, we propose an innovative treatment paradigm based on creating an inhospitable bone marrow environment for myeloma through stimulating bone formation, increasing antitumor osteoblastic factors, and blocking activity of osteoclastic factors that promote myeloma.  This therapeutic concept is supported by clinical observations and by our previous and preliminary studies demonstrating that osteoblasts inhibit myeloma growth and that osteoblast-activating agents induce bone formation while also reducing myeloma burden in vivo.  Moreover, osteoblasts produce high levels of small-leucine-rich-proteoglycans (SLRPs), which are essential for proper bone remodeling and, notably, also inhibit some tumor types; our preliminary study revealed that SLRPs suppress myeloma growth.  We also showed that osteoclasts support myeloma growth via physical contact, and we identified fibroblast activation factor (FAP) as a critical microenvironmental factor involved in this processes.  Our overall hypothesis is that factors upregulated on osteoclasts in myelomatous bone promote myeloma cell survival and that bone-building factors produced by osteoblasts negate myeloma progression.  We will exploit our unique in vivo and ex vivo systems for primary myeloma to study three Specific Aims.  We will (Aim 1) determine the involvement of SLRPs in osteoblast-induced myeloma growth inhibition and unravel anti-myeloma molecular mechanisms of these proteoglycans ex vivo and in vivo.  We will test the effect of blocking SLRPs on osteoblast-induced myeloma growth inhibition, unravel SLRPs molecular mechanisms, and test their anti-myeloma efficacy.  We will (Aim 2) determine the effects of the potent osteoblast-activating factors, dickkopf-1 (DKK1) neutralizing antibody, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bortezomib on myeloma bone disease and myeloma development and progression in primary myelomatous SCID-rab mice.  We will (Aim 3) determine the role of FAP in myeloma pathogenesis and as a potential microenvironment-targeted therapy; using recombinant FAP, specific FAP inhibitors and short-interfering RNA approaches we will unravel direct and indirect effects of FAP on myeloma progression in vitro and in vivo.  Work under this study will validate novel microenvironmental-targeted therapies associated with activation of osteoclasts and explore the use of bone-anabolic agents and SLRPs as effective and safe strategies to improve patients' quality of life and control myeloma.  Project Narrative:  Malignant myeloma cells manifest in the bone marrow and cause severe, painful bone disease.  Our main goal is to create a hostile environment for tumor cells by controlling myeloma-induced bone destruction.  Our study will increase knowledge of myeloma pathogenesis, which will help develop new approaches to treat myeloma bone disease and tumor progression simultaneously, improve patients' quality of life, and prevent myeloma development in individuals who are at risk for developing this incurable disease."
8117,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Rationale: A food-based approach to cancer chemoprevention emphasizes the potential for complex mixtures of preventive agents in whole foods to inhibit multiple processes of carcinogenesis. Supporting this, several preclinical animal studies have been conducted that demonstrate the remarkable chemopreventive activity of lyophilyzed black raspberries [LBR] on tumor development, including oral cancer. Preliminary data by us demonstrate that short-term in situ delivery of LBR can modulate the expression of key regulatory genes in cancer cells and  at-risk normal  oral mucosa of pre-surgical cancer patients that may favor the prevention of cancer development. Hypothesis: Long-term daily exposure of LBR by post-surgical head and neck [HN] cancer patients will modulate expression of genes critical in the development of oral cancer. This modulation may predict the preventive potential of LBR in human oral carcinogenesis. Experimental Approach: Phase IB- IIA post-surgical clinical trials will be conducted in 210 individuals following surgical resection of stage I or II HN cancers. Daily LBR doses (0, 4, 8 gm) in two delivery systems will be given for a period of six months. Oral cavity scrapings, blood, urine, and saliva will be collected at selected time points and evaluated for outcomes of adherance/exposure, safety/toxicity, and capacity to modulate specific gene expressions associated with carcinogenic progression. Specific Aims: Aim 1. Determine the adherence of post-surgical patients to clinical trial design expectations and define tolerability and, potential adverse effects of long-term LBR administration. Aim 2. Determine the interrelationships between exposure, dose and delivery vehicle, and uptake of LBR components in oral tissues. Aim 3. Evaluate the ability of LBR to modulate gene expression in  high-risk  oral mucosa of post-surgical oral cancer. Aim 4. Analyze for the persistence of modulation genes following cessation of LBR treatment. This novel translational study will provide essential data establishing the scientific foundation for experimental and design parameters to be included in a future Phase III randomized clinical trial and is the first to examine the molecular effects of long-term LBR administration on  at-risk  oral mucosa in post-surgical cancer patients. It will also provide valuable insights related to the modulation of critical genes that might lead to oral cancer prevention.     This novel translational study will provide essential data establishing the scientific foundation for experimental and design parameters to be included in a future Phase III randomized clinical trial and is the first to examine the molecular effects of long-term LBR administration on  at-risk  oral mucosa in post-surgical cancer patients and will provide valuable insights related to the modulation of critical genes that might lead to oral cancer prevention."
8127,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The increase in alcohol (ALC) use and abuse by adolescents during recent years poses several risks for them associated with growth, endocrine functions and development. The overall goal of this study is to obtain information which will allow us to better understand the detrimental effects and mechanisms of action of ALC on the female pubertal process. The studies proposed will assess influences of specific puberty related peptides, the involvement and activation of important genes critical to brain events leading to mammalian puberty, and discern the effects of ALC on their actions and interactions. In vivo and in vitro techniques using molecular and physiological approaches will be utilized following chronic and acute ALC exposure to address six aims which will collectively allow us to determine what factors are involved, the mechanisms of interference and potential means to reverse the detrimental effects of ALC on puberty related events. Aim 1 will assess the effects of ALC on the synthesis of specific puberty related hypothalamic genes and proteins, with the results being correlated with hypothalamic, pituitary and ovarian hormones, as well as other indices of puberty. Aim 2 will assess regulation of hypothalamic genes by peptides involved at puberty and determine the actions of ALC. Aim 3 will assess the expression and regulation of glial and neuronal signaling-adhesion genes at puberty and determine the effects of ALC. Aim 4 will assess the effects of ALC on the hypothalamic action of specific peptides that induce luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) secretion at puberty. Aim 5 will use cultured rat hypothalamic astrocytes and an LHRH neuronal cell line to further assess glial-neuronal mechanisms associated with LHRH secretion, determine the actions of ALC, and investigate potential means for reversal of ALC actions. Aim 6 will test the ability of specific substances in vivo to protect against or reverse ALC-induced delayed puberty. This research, which is relevant to adolescent health and development, is intended to further identify consequences of ALC consumption with regard to hormonal events and their actions which can alter female pubertal maturation."
8212,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant)    Increasing evidence has emerged supporting the idea that many more CNS synapses are made than are eventually retained, and that this phenomenon includes a process of synapse specification in which certain sites become stabilized and others are lost. Although recent work supports that young synapses are structurally and functionally distinct, the processes by which young synapses get stabilized largely remain unknown. Protein synthesis is required for mechanisms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD), as well as for learning and memory, where synapses are likely to be structurally modified. However, it is not yet known whether the stabilization of newly formed synapses requires protein synthesis. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that newly formed synapses are labile structures that require protein synthesis for their stabilization and subsequent maintenance. Treatments that stabilize synapses should render them more resistant to such a requirement than those that destabilize synapses. Ribosomal clustering beneath synapses has been shown to be particularly prominent during development when the capacity for protein synthesis in dendritically enriched neuropil peaks; a general requirement for protein synthesis may thus operate locally. An understanding of the regulation of synaptogenesis and of the differences between dendritic and somatic regulation of protein synthesis has great clinical significance. This link is particularly clear in Fragile X mental retardation where changes in the regulation of dendritic protein synthesis have lasting consequences on synapse morphology and plasticity"
8257,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a growing epidemic within today's world population. Highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) are becoming increasingly effective at decreasing or even eliminating the serum viral load of HIV positive individuals, resulting in increased life spans. Unfortunately, long-term harmful side effects (hyperlipidemias, lipodystrophy and insulin resistance) of HAART therapeutics are becoming evident. The mechanism(s) by which HIV protease inhibitors (PI) therapy leads to dysregulation of sterol and lipid metabolism is unclear. The liver is the major organ responsible for maintaining lipid homeostasis in the body. The proposed experiments in this new application will explore the mechanism(s) by which different HIV PIs alter hepatic cholesterol, bile acid and fatty acid metabolism. The specific aims of this application are: 1) Determine the effects of the most commonly used HIV PI (ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, Iopinavir, atazanavir) on cholesterol, bile acids and fatty acid metabolism using primary adult rat hepatocytes as a model system; 2) Determine the effects of HIV PI on hepatic cholesterol, fatty acid, and bile acid metabolism and lipoprotein profiles in a mouse in vivo model 3) Elucidate the mechanism(s) where by indinavir (and other HIV PIs) alters hepatic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in primary rat hepatocytes. Test the hypothesis that HIV PIs alters the intracellular movement of cholesterol and/or protein turnover rates of sterol responsive element binding proteins (SREBPs). Knowledge of how HIV PI alter lipid metabolism may allow for more effective, long term approaches for treating HIV infected individuals."
8291,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Nutrition is considered a cornerstone of day-to-day treatment of childhood diabetes mellitus (DM). However, little is known regarding the role of nutritional factors in the natural history of diagnosed Type 1 (T1) DM in youth, including progression of ¿-cell decline and the emergence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The proposed work is an ancillary study to the CDC/DDT and NIH/NIDDK funded SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth project, which is an ongoing multi-center, observational study of DM diagnosed in youth age 0-19 years. Using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, the overall goal of the SEARCH Nutrition Ancillary Study (SNAS) is to examine associations of nutritional factors with 1) the progression of insulin secretion defects, and 2) the presence of CVD risk factors in youth with Type 1 DM. Consistent with the objective of PAR-07-024, SNAS is a natural extension of the stated aims of SEARCH Phase 2, which focuses on the evolution of DM type-related characteristics including insulin secretion defects, and the evolution of risk factors for long term complications of DM. From SEARCH data, dietary intake in adolescents with DM falls far short of nutrition recommendations. Moreover, the prevalence of CVD risk factors is elevated among youth with Type 1 DM, compared to youth without DM. To rigorously examine nutritional factors as determinants of metabolic status of youth with Type 1 DM, we propose to 1) obtain new data on history of infant feeding practices by questionnaire, and 2) obtain new laboratory test results on selected nutrient biomarkers (plasma tocopherols, vitamin D, magnesium, and fatty acids) using stored samples from SEARCH participants, and 3) conduct a Diet Assessment Sub-study to advance our capacity to appropriately construct statistical models to address measurement error in dietary data. Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate nutritional factors as potential determinants of preserved beta call function in approximately 1140 youth with Type 1 DM confirmed by positive DM autoantibodies. Subjects for Specific Aim 1 will have had diabetes diagnosed in 2002 - 2005, with fasting C-peptide data available longitudinally from the ongoing SEARCH study. Additionally, a subset of these youth will have beta cell function measured longitudinally as mixed meal stimulated C-peptide. Specific Aim 2 is to evaluate nutritional factors in relation to CVD risk factors in approximately 2415 youth with Type 1 DM prevalent in 2001 or incident in 2002 - 2005, using both crosssectional and longitudinal analyses. Results will uniquely inform nutrition recommendations and future clinical trials of nutrition interventions for youth with DM. All SEARCH sites are included in this project. Our multidisciplinary team is led by Dr Elizabeth Mayer-Davis, a well-recognized expert in diet and diabetes who directed the original SEARCH diet assessment."
8293,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host defense against the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans depends on both innate and acquired humoral and cellular immune mechanisms. Cryptococcal infection is acquired by inhalation. Therefore, the lung is the site of the initial encounter between host and microbe and the outcome of infection is decided by the local immune response. In the lung, the major host defense cell type is the alveolar macrophage. Recent studies have established that the alveolar macrophage plays a critical role in the outcome of cryptococcal infection. C. neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can replicate inside macrophages. Successful containment of cryptococcal infection involves the formation of granulomas where yeast cells can reside for long periods of time. Hence, the interaction between macrophages and C. neoformans is probably the most important determinant of the outcome of C. neoformans infection in that it governs both host defense and C. neoformans virulence and pathogenicity. In the past funding period the Casadevall laboratory made two discoveries related to C. neoformans-macrophage interactions. First, it was observed that phagocytosis triggers macrophage replication, a phenomenon that either benefits or harms the host depending on whether what ensues is one infected cell or two infected cells, respectively. Second, C. neoformans was shown to exit from infected macrophages through a mechanism that involves homotypic phagosome fusion and phagosome extrusion with survival of the host cell. This application proposes to dissect the outcome of C. neoformans phagocytosis with regards to fungal and host cell survival and damage, cell cycle progression and phagosome extrusion. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) To determine the outcome of C. neoformans phagocytosis by FcR and/or complement receptor; 2) To identify the mechanism of action and outcome of C. neoformans-induced cell cycle progression in macrophages; 3) To identify the mechanism of action and outcome of macro-phagosome exocytosis in macrophages. Completion of these studies is expected to shed new light on the two fundamental cellular processes of cell replication and phagocytosis and to provide new insights on the mechanisms of C. neoformans intracellular pathogenesis. Relevance. This application seeks funds to explore how the pathogenic fungus C. neoformans interacts with the most important host defense cell in the lungs. This information is important for understanding how the fungus establishes itself in the lungs and causes disease. Furthermore, these studies will provide information that could be used to design vaccines and new therapies based on immunological reagents such as Abs.Project Narrative: This application seeks funds to explore how the pathogenic fungus interacts with the most important host defense cell in the lungs.

8319,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress contributes to myriad psychopathologies, including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and drug use relapse. A common thread binding these disorders appears to be the stress-associated alteration in cognitive processes, namely learning and memory. Considerable human and animal research has shown that the hippocampus, a brain structure necessary for the formation of stable declarative (or explicit) memory, is highly susceptible to stress. Rodent studies further indicate that stress impairs long-term potentiation (LTP), a leading candidate cellular mechanism of information storage, in the hippocampus. We have recently discovered that the amygdala plays a necessary, time-dependent role in the emergence of stress effects on hippocampal LTP and memory. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the amygdala is an important component of the central stress mechanism that regulates neurocognitive functioning. The long-term goal of this research is to construct a general experimental and theoretical basis for understanding how stress influences the hippocampus - from synaptic plasticity to neural activity to behavior - and incorporate this in a systems-level model that can organize existing data, predict new results, and generalize to other cognitive processes impacted by stress. There are four specific aims of the project: (1) an IN VITRO ANALYSIS will investigate the central stress mechanism altering hippocampal LTP; (2) a BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS will determine the nature of central stress mechanism influencing hippocampal memory; (3) a SINGLE UNIT ANALYSIS will relate stress effects on specific behaviors with the activity of hippocampal neurons; and (4) GENERALIZATION OF THE MODEL will test whether the central stress mechanism identified in the first three aims is applicable to other types of learning and memory. Information generated from this project would be of significance (1) from a basic scientific perspective, providing valuable insights into the neuronal substrates underlying stress effects on neurocognition; and (2) from an applied perspective, providing testable hypotheses for explaining neurobiological changes that occur during stressful situations, thereby allowing insights into and treatment of various stress-related disorders that severely limit the quality of human life in today's increasingly hectic and long-living society."
8332,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates many essential cellular processes including cell division. The recent development of cancer drugs that inhibit the proteasome suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may provide many new therapeutic targets. The goal of this project is to develop new chemical inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and to understand how this pathway regulates cell division. We first plan to characterize novel small molecule inhibitors of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase that is essential for cell division. APC inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of cancer, because they may inhibit cell division or sensitize cells to antimitotic drugs such as taxol. Additionally, APC inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of diseases that involve axonal injury, because the APC negatively regulates axon growth. Our studies of these small molecules will also provide important new insights into how the APC is regulated by activator proteins. Another goal of our studies is to characterize ubistatins, compounds that prevent ubiquitin- dependent proteolysis by binding to ubiquitin chains. However, the mechanism of ubiquitin chain binding remains unclear, and we plan to synthesize new ubistatin derivatives that will allow us to determine the structure of ubistatins bound to ubiquitin chains. The structural information will enable us to synthesize more potent and perhaps more cell-permeable versions of ubistatins, enhancing the utility of these compounds to investigators in the field, and accelerating the development of ubiquitin-binding compounds as drug candidates. A third goal of our research program is to understand how ubiquitinated substrates are recognized for degradation by the proteasome. It has been assumed that a specific type of ubiquitin chain (linked through lysine-48 of ubiquitin) is required for degradation by the proteasome. Our studies of ubiquitinated cyclin B1 suggest that other types of ubiquitin linkages may be sufficient to target the protein for degradation. We therefore plan to determine the types of ubiquitination that are required for degradation of cyclin B1 by purified proteasomes and in complex cell extracts. These studies are critical for understanding how small molecule inhibitors of ubiquitination and ubiquitin chain recognition may perturb degradation. Finally, we want to understand how the localization of substrates affects their degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have identified a novel sequence element in cyclin B1 that recruits the protein to chromatin during mitosis. We plan to identify the protein that recruits cyclin B1 to chromatin, and to determine the functional consequences of cyclin B1 association with chromatin. Together these studies will provide new chemical tools for studying the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and will help us understand how a critical substrate of this pathway, cyclin B1, is regulated during the cell cycle."
8339,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate constant, also called the magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD), reports the power density of fluctuations created by intra- and inter-molecular motions as a function of the nuclear Larmor frequency, which may be varied from 5 kHz to 500 MHz for 1H. The use of paramagnetic contributions to the nuclear relaxation extends the effective frequency range to 0.3 THz or time scales of order 1 ps. Combined with appropriate statistical theories, the MRD profiles provide a powerful method for studying molecular dynamics, protein dynamics in particular, and factors that modify nuclear spin relaxation such as relaxation agents used in MRI. This laboratory has assembled unique instrumentation for MRD measurements. We propose to: characterize the dynamics of internally trapped water molecules in proteins based on MRD data from rotationally immobilized proteins; define the role of membrane- bound proteins in controlling water spin-lattice relaxation in membrane model systems; extend the spin-fracton relaxation theory to the case of quadrupolar spins, deuterium and nitrogen-14, to test the generality of the theory and the implications for energy redistribution in proteins; measure the high frequency motions of water adjacent to specific paramagnetic centers in proteins; define the conditions for maximum water-proton relaxivity for metal chelate and organic radicals conjugated to rotationally immobilized proteins, which is important in understanding how targeted MRI contrast agents can work; measure accurate relaxation dispersion profiles for excised tissue systems from 10 kHz to 500 MHz to provide complete data sets for comparison with much more scattered experiments accumulated in a clinical setting; measure 31P and 13C MRD profiles for commonly observed metabolites in a model tissue matrix to provide an understanding of the relaxation mechanisms over a wide field range; measure the MRD profiles and test the spin-fracton relaxation theory for DNA as a model stiff linear system; measure the MRD profiles for specific intramolecular vectors in proteins using direct detection of protein spins; and use zinc and calcium metal sites in carbonic anhydrase II and the C2A domain of synaptotagmin I in combination with nitroxide labeled cysteine mutants to measure complete MRD profiles of these specifically defined intramolecular vectors. The results of these studies have direct bearing on how we understand energy redistribution in proteins or how structural disturbances propagate through the structure as a possible component of function. There are immediate applications of this work in the context of clinical magnetic imaging, both in extracting additional information from existing approaches and the development of new classes of targeted contrast agents.     This project will use measurements of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate constants to deduce the nature of intra and inter-molecular motions in proteins that affect contrast in MRI and the information that may be obtained from in vivo magnetic resonance protocols. Included are studies targeted spin-relaxation or contrast agents for MRI that are fundamentally different in design and action from presently used soluble contrast agents. The molecular biophysical foundations of this work are important for understanding the functional role of protein dynamics."
8363,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobile genetic elements have profoundly influenced the evolution of bacterial pathogens. Many determinants of virulence and antibiotic resistance are borne by mobile elements, such as plasmids and bacteriophages, which are capable of horizontal transmission. During this grant cycle, we studied several aspects of the life cycle of CTXF, a filamentous phage that encodes cholera toxin, the principal virulence factor of the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae. We described novel mechanisms that mediate the integration of CTXF into the V. cholerae chromosome and that govern CTXF gene expression. We also expanded the scope of our work to explore several aspects of the molecular biology of SXT, a V. cholerae-derived integrating conjugative element (ICE) that encodes multiple antibiotic resistance genes. In recent years, SXT and closely related elements have become highly prevalent in V. cholerae clinical isolates. Our long-term goal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms that enable the dissemination of CTXF and SXT. We propose to explore 5 aspects of the molecular biology of CTXF and SXT that govern their transmission and evolution. Experiments in Aim I to elucidate mechanisms that control expression of RstR, the CTXF repressor, will reveal how two host factors, LexA and RpoS, contribute to the novel genetic circuitry governing CTXF production. In Aims II-V, we will explore the molecular bases for aspects of the SXT life-cycle that distinguish this mobile element from phages and plasmids. Studying these novel features of SXT will enhance our understanding of ICEs, an extensive and medically important set of mobile elements that have not been subject to intensive study, and will shed light on processes that have contributed to the prevalence and diversity of SXT-related ICEs in the gamma proteobacteria. In particular, we will explore II) steps in SXT conjugation that limit its transfer to new hosts, III) genes required for SXT maintenance in donor cells, IV) mechanisms for preventing redundant transmission of SXT to hosts in which it is already present and V) processes by which new/hybrid SXT-related ICEs are generated. Completion of these studies will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that control of horizontal gene transfer and yield knowledge of fundamental aspects of prokaryote cell biology and pathogen evolution. Furthermore, these studies may provide valuable information for the creation of new antimicrobial agents and vaccines."
8404,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomarkers of clinical activity are critical for targeted anti-cancer therapy development and are becoming important for the care of individual patients. In a prototypical tyrosine kinase pathway, governed by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), functional activity of the pathway is assessed by the phosphorylation status of EGFR and downstream signaling intermediaries such as phospho-ERK and phospho-Akt. Interventions that block the function of EGFR (such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies) may lead to lack of phosphorylation of these downstream intermediaries. Traditionally, phosphorylated proteins have been analyzed by Western blots performed on tumor protein extracts from as many as 106 cells. A method is proposed that can utilize small sample to achieve a similar level of detection of phopshoproteins in the EGFR pathway. Tumor cells would be isolated from peripheral blood obtained before and after administration of an EGFR targeted therapy and the phosphorylation status of key EGFR pathway intermediates would be analyzed.    The proposed approach to sample preparation is based on two molecular recognition events: capture of analytes of interest (in this case, tumor cells, or their components after lysis) on non-magnetic beads carrying receptors as well as  codes ; and then binding these beads by magnetic beads carrying  anticodes . The codes and anti-codes can simply be two complementary DNA strands. Unlike single-step magnetic-bead capture, the proposed method allows simultaneous capture of multiple analytes by incubation with different bead types at the same time. They are then sorted by consecutive exposure to various types of  decoding  beads.    After processing the samples to simultaneously capture multiple analytes of interest, the sample will be loaded onto electrowetting (EW) biochip. The sample will be subdivided into droplets of similar size and run past droplets containing decoding magnetic beads. The ability of EW chip to rapidly process multiple droplets enables the sorting procedure. For example, different aliquots of bead suspension can be reacted with the batches of magnetic beads in different sequences, to avoid bias due to non-specific binding. The ultimate advantage is sample concentration by at least 103x and removal of background material. The sample need not be subdivided which increases the sensitivity and speed of multiplexed assays while allowing minimally-invasive sample collection. Moreover, the final analysis - immunoassay, or PCR or RTPCR, - can be performed on same chip, taking advantage of the ultimate sensitivity and dynamic range of these liquid-phase assays. Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc. will team with collaborators at Duke University's Comprehensive Cancer Center to execute this project."
8421,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in the human connexin26 gene (Cx26, or GJB2) are the leading cause of nonsyndromic deafness in the United States. Mutations in other connexins, Cx30 (GJB6), Cx31 (GJB3), and Cx32 (GJB1) have also been linked to hearing loss in humans. While this illuminates a critical function for cochlear gap junctions, it is unclear how a common pathology can arise from mutations within different connexin genes that have an overlapping expression pattern in the inner ear, as is the case for Cx26, Cx30, Cx31 and Cx32. There are no gap junctions between the sensory hair cells in humans; but they are expressed in the supporting cells of the cochlea. The current hypothesis is that these junctions play a role in the re-circulation of potassium ions between the end lymph and perilymph. It is difficult to reconcile this model with the available data on potassium permeation through gap junction channels, as all connexins are readily permeated by this caution and the loss of a single cochlear connexin would still leave other functional connexins available to perform this task. Connexins do show differential permeability to a wide range of other small molecules and second messengers, and we hypothesize that these permeation differences are critical for cochlear function, and more difficult to compensate for following the functional loss of one of the several available channel subunits. The objective of this application is to precisely define which permeation properties of Cx26 are necessary for normal auditory function in humans. To achieve this goal, we first propose to screen mutant Cx26 alleles for functional activity in the paired Xenopus oocyte assay. Cx26 mutants that retain channel function will have their perm selectivity properties analyzed by dual patch clamp methods in transected mammalian cell lines. Finally, We will generate and characterize genetically engineered mice where the native Cx26 gene has been replaced by the functionally active human Cx26 disease causing mutations. We will use genetic knock-in techniques to generate mice that will allow us to evaluate the in vitro derived functional differences in an animal model. Contrasting the differences in permeation between wild type and disease causing variants of Cx26 will not only provide mechanistic insight into hearing loss, but will also provide a general model for the need for connexin diversity in other tissues where human disease results from mutations in connexin genes."
8456,HHS,HHS,"Huntingtin associated protein-1 (HAP1) is enriched in neurons and is found to be involved inintracellular trafficking. The role of HAP1 in intracellular trafficking is supported by its interactions with anumber of proteins including dynactin p150 and kinesin, which are involved in microtubule-dependenttransport. Recent studies also suggest that HAP1 participates in vesicular trafficking and endocytosisof membrane receptors. The crucial function of HAP1 was further demonstrated by HAP1 knockoutmice that are pbstnatally lethal and show neurodegeneration in the brain. These interesting findingsraise more questions about how HAP1 is involved in the complex intracellular trafficking in neurons.Our recent studies show that HAP1 interacts with 14-3-3 and that this interaction is regulated byphosphorylation of HAP1. We hypothesize that HAP1 may link specific cargos to the microtubuletransporters and that it's interactions with partners are regulated by its posttranslational modifications.Such regulation allows HAP1 to participate in intracellular transport of various cargos and endocytosisof membrane receptors. Given the idea that HAP1 dysfunction may be involved in HD pathology, it isalso important to investigate if the loss of HAP1 can affect its function in intracellular trafficking.Accordingly, we propose three aims in this application. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether 14-3-3 andphosphorylation regulate the interactions of HAP1 with microtubule transporters dynactin p150andkinesin. In Aim-2, we will use HAP1 knockout mice and siRNA approaches to examine whetherdecreasing MAPI's expression alters microtubule-dependent transport and neuronal function indifferent types of neurons. In Aim-3, we will study whether HAP1 deficiency affects endocytosis ofmembrane receptors and whether defective HAP1-associated endocytosis contributes to HDpathology. These studies aim to elucidate the function of HAP1 and to help understand themechanisms for intracellular trafficking in neurons."
8483,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inter-individual differences in overall language proficiency can be related to one's level of language comprehension, but moment-to-moment changes in attention may also explain within-subject variation in language competence. In contrast to what is known about the cortical systems involved in reading, the neural mechanisms governing attentional modulation of verbal language-processing networks are not well understood. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is intended to help fill this gap by providing the candidate with a structured plan for career development in two major fields of biomedical research that represent new career directions: brain mechanisms of language, and the use of contemporary functional imaging technologies to study language processing. The ultimate goal is to augment the candidate's extensive background in systems physiology using animal models and to foster his professional development in the specific areas of verbal language processing, reciprocal interactions between memory and attention networks, and the modulation of functional connectivity between these brain systems. His systems perspective and broad knowledge of the neural basis for behavior can help fill a critical need in our imaging community to develop testable functional models of effective connectivity between the distributed brain networks involved in bottom-up and top-down attentional control of human language processing. The research plan will take advantage of state-of-the-art fMRI facilities at the University of Arizona (UA) to investigate a little-studied area of human neuroscience: cortical and subcortical mechanisms linking language, attention, and memory. The training and research experience provided by this K01 award will enable the candidate's successful transition from basic research in learning & memory, systems physiology and animal communication to a career as an independent scientist studying the functional neural architecture of attentional control over auditory learning and language processing, using non-invasive biomedical imaging tools as the primary means of data collection. Relevance: The attention system governs how the brain selects only some information from the environment and admits it to consciousness, enabling us to focus awareness on objects and events that are relevant to our immediate goals. However, the limited capacity of the attention system varies greatly between individuals and under different cognitive loads. Attention is also a crucial cognitive component in many disorders affecting language, including schizophrenia, ADHD, specific language impairments, and language learning disabilities (LLD), but what roles attention plays in the expression of these complex spectrum disorders is not well understood. Therefore, in parallel to normal language processing, we will also examine patients with LLD and/or ADHD to explore specific models of functional connectivity and modulation in the brain using high-field fMRI."
8500,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks to establish a training program in trauma care and injury control research in the Republic of Mozambique. It is built on a preexisting partnership between a US University (Emory University) and a Mozambican University (University Eduardo Mondlane or UEM). Mozambique is a southern African nation with a significant healthcare burden related to injury, and with minimal current clinical or research infrastructure to strengthen the care of injured patients. Three stages of training are described in this application: formal academic training, bridge fellowships in the U.S., and subsequent in-country research. The formal academic training is based on the core MPH curriculum currently taught at UEM, supplemented with focused courses in Trauma Care, Violence and Injury Prevention, and a distance education course in Epidemiology. In addition, the University of South Africa (UNISA), Institute for Social and Health Sciences, has agreed to serve as a regional resource for trainees, offering additional focused injury coursework on an elective basis. The Bridge Fellowships at Emory will function as  mini-sabbaticals  to nurture research protocols and provide training in the ethical, legal and social implications of research. Finally, trainees will return to Mozambique to undertake in-country research supported by small startup grants to help trainees launch their first project with ongoing mentorship. Close follow-up and collaboration will be provided during all three phases, and on an ongoing basis. While some trainees will undertake all 3 phases of the training, others may require only select phases (perhaps spending more time at UNISA in supplemental courses, or spending more time on in-country research). Evidence of strong in-country support is presented. This plan has several advantages: it is highly cost-effective, it relies on the strengths of two WHO collaborating centres for injury control (Emory and UNISA), it uses a regional or  south to south  training approach, in-country supplemental training will reach others beyond our core trainees, it signals Emory's intent to Mozambique to be a long-term partner in building the nation's capacity to conduct high quality research in trauma care and injury control, and it lays the foundation for a regional collaborative that could ultimately lead to expansion of this trauma and injury control research beyond Mozambique to include other nations in Southern and East Africa."
8501,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel (RYR1) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is responsible for the release of Ca2+ from internal stores during skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling. This channel is modulated by both nitrosylation and oxidation. We propose to elucidate the mechanisms and the physiological role of these specific modulations. Cysteine 3635 (C3635) is the major target of S-nitrosylation on RYR1 and is one of the cysteines involved in the formation of an inter-subunit disulfide bond in response to oxidants. We have found that the other cysteine of the inter-subunit disulfide is located between amino acids 1999 and 2075 on an adjacent subunit. In this application we propose to: 1) Identify the cysteines involved in the response of RYR1 to NO and oxidation and determine the effect of channel modulators on the redox modification of these cysteines. 2) Compare functional effects of mutating cysteines 3635, 2021 and 2042 in RYR1 on activity and response to oxidants and NO donors. 3) Evaluate the role of cysteine 3635 of RYR1 in E-C coupling and muscle function by creating a mouse with a cysteine to alanine mutation at C3635. We predict that this will alter the leak of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby altering muscle contractile properties and fiber type distribution.  Mutations in RYR1 that increase Ca2+ leak through the channel have been shown to correlate with two human diseases, malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. Our studies are designed to elucidate the role of oxidation and nitrosylation of this channel in regulation of Ca2+ leak through this channel. The elucidation of the mechanisms whereby these modulations alter channel activity may allow the identification of new targets for intervention in malignant hyperthermia and central core disease."
8505,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone growth in children occurs by endochondral ossification in cartilaginous growth plates at the ends of long bones. In the last decade, analysis of transgenic constructs has become the single most powerful approach for the study of endocrine, paracrine and autocrine regulators acting during the chondrocytic differentiation cascade. However, despite major advances in delineating the cellular and molecular events that define skeletal growth and its regulatory circuitry, relatively little is known about the physiology of the vascular access that endocrine (and potentially paracrine) regulators require to reach growth plate chondrocytes, and how these molecules move within the spatially heterogeneous growth plate matrix. To a large extent this reflects a lack of methods to study these questions under real time conditions in living animals. This is particularly challenging for studying the growth plate, which has three conceptually different blood supplies: epiphyseal, metaphyseal, and perichondrial (including a ring vessel and a plexus.)     We will apply a novel approach to these questions by utilizing multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for multi-hour in vivo imaging of the murine proximal tibial growth plate. Our experimental system is anesthetized 4-5-week-old transgenic mice with green fluorescent protein linked to the collagen II promoter (Col II/GFP). The specific aims are summarized as:     To test the hypothesis that the rate of delivery into the growth plate varies for molecules of different size, by directly imaging the arrival of IV injected fluorescent tracers (starting with dextrans but moving to known biologically significant regulators of chondrocytic differentiation.)     To test the hypothesis that tracers of different molecular weight reach the growth plate through different vascular routes and travel within the growth plate in different matrix subcompartments. For the epiphyseal vasculature the analysis will include time points prior to full development of the secondary center of ossification.     To image cellular turnover events at the metaphyseal chondroosseous junction in real time, as an  internal clock  for correlation with data on rates of bone elongation.     These analyses are relevant to the understanding of growth aberrations such as trauma with premature closure and disruption of the periosteum leading to overgrowth. Detailed functional knowledge of vascular routes to the growth plate, and movement of molecules within the growth plate, is essential as thought is given to targeting therapeutic agents to the growth plate."
8567,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cleft palate, the most common craniofacial deformity in the USA, may caused by a failure of palatal medial edge seam (MES) cells to undergo complete disintegration, which is necessary in establishing confluence of the palatal stroma. While, Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) (-1, 2 and 3 are involved in palatogenesis, interestingly, TGF(3 is the only member of this family that is involved in palatal seam disintegration. TGF(3 signaling initiates and completes sequential phases of cellular differentiation that is required during MES disintegration, which progress between 14 to 17 embryonic days in the murine system. Understanding the cellular mechanism of palatal MES disintegration in response to TGF(3 signaling will result in new approaches to defining the causes of cleft palate and other facial clefts that may result from failure of seam disintegration. We have isolated MES primary cells to study the details of TGF(3 signaling mechanisms during palate development. To elucidate the mechanisms of MES disintegration by TGF(3, using several biochemical and genetic approaches, we demonstrated a novel mechanism of MES disintegration where MES undergoes cell cycle arrest, cell migration and apoptosis chronologically to generate immaculate palatal confluency during palatogenesis. We have shown that robust TGF(3 signaling induces both Smad dependent and Smad independent pathways to activate many transcription factors such as Snail, Slug, SIP1 and LEF1. It is unclear how these pathways and activated transcription factors promote cell cycle arrest, cell migration and apoptosis in the same cell type. We, therefore, wish to further study the mechanisms and diversity of TGF(3 signaling in MES cell function and how they are related to differential transcription factors and pathways to cause controlled MES disintegration. In this proposal, we would like to examine TGF(3 signaling towards these three individual cell functions. The broad objective of this grant is to understand the tissue transitions involved in the development of the palate and craniofacial mesenchyme in response to TGF( signaling. Each specific aim in the proposed study is designed to analyze the three phenotypical changes triggered by TGF(3, such as cell cycle arrest (Aim #1), migration (Aim #2) and apoptosis (Aim #3) required for MES disintegration to generate structural and functional component of the confluent palate. The rationale for this study is that successful completion of the proposed research will contribute to a missing, fundamental element to our base knowledge about the diverse functions of TGF(3 without which the cell cycle arrest, migration and apoptosis during MES disintegration cannot be understood. We believe that in some cases, knowledge of the basic cell biology will lead to more effective treatment of facial clefting."
8594,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project examines the relationship between cognitive and linguistic representations of spatial events in children. Classic theories of cognitive and linguistic development assume that spatial concepts are largely universal and that spatial language (e.g. the expression of spatial locations, paths and motions) maps directly onto preexisting, shared spatial categories. More recent theories, pointing to wide cross-linguistic differences in spatial encoding, suggest that important aspects of spatial cognition may not be universal but may be shaped by exposure to the way spatial relations are encoded within a specific language. The goal of this project is to investigate the processes underlying both the processing and the acquisition of spatial vocabulary in populations speaking different languages so as to disentangle language-specific from language- independent (potentially universal) components of spatial language. The proposed plan combines cross-linguistic behavioral experiments with eye tracking methods, allowing us to examine the moment-by-moment processes underlying the assembly of spatial descriptions, as well as the processes supporting the acquisition of novel spatial terms in controlled experimental settings. This is the first time this combination of convergent methods has been used to study how linguistic and nonlinguistic representations come together in the minds of young and more experienced speakers cross-linguistically. This integrated approach views the mapping from spatial event perception to language as a dynamic process, one that unfolds along multiple time scales ranging from milliseconds (as in planning and understanding utterances) to years (as in developing the ability to speak one's native language). This basic research program will inform theories of normal language development and processing and may ultimately contribute to accounts of linguistic and conceptual development in bilingual populations and children with specific language impairments. The eye tracking techniques developed for this project can lead to interventions for children with atypical linguistic and cognitive development, and in some form serve as a diagnostic of cognitive and linguistic difficulties in patients with different types of brain lesions or aphasias. Our toolbox could also be used to inform studies of bilingualism (e.g., by investigating connections between language and mental representation)."
8618,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad goals of this project are to understand the computations that can be performed by a neural circuit. The vertebrate retina is chosen as a model system, because of our ability to achieve complete recordings of its output while stimulating with realistic patterns of light, as well as its intricate and well-characterized anatomy. The retina's representation of visual stimuli changes dramatically between the photoreceptors, which use a camera-like representation where each cell is a pixel, and the ganglion cells, which represent the image with a complex and highly overlapping basis set of visual features. We seek to characterize the manner in which visual scenes are represented by the complete population of retinal ganglion cells.     The Specific Aims are: 1) characterize the diversity and stereotypy of the visual features represented within the population of ganglion cells by performing functional classification; 2) measure the correlation both within and among the parallel visual channels; 3) formulate decoding strategies to perform visual discrimination using large populations of ganglion cells. Our functional classification will minimize the effects of subtle variations from one retinal preparation to the next by recording simultaneously from 200+ ganglion cells from a single retina and will use information theory to assess functional differences using a battery of visual stimuli including natural movies. Our characterization of the patterns of correlation among groups of ganglion cells will use new information-theoretic techniques, including the maximum entropy approach. Finally, our decoders will seek to make use of our models of correlation in large populations to improve the accuracy of visual discriminations."
8624,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In hypertensive individuals, exercise elicits excessive increases in arterial blood pressure, heart rate and vascular resistance. These potentially dangerous elevations in circulatory hemodynamics increase the risk for adverse cardiac events or stroke during exercise. We have previously established that overactivity of the exercise pressor reflex, a circulatory reflex originating within skeletal muscle, contributes importantly to the generation of these heightened cardiovascular responses. Further, evidence from our laboratory suggests that both the muscle mechanoreflex and metaboreflex, the two functional components of the exercise pressor reflex, drive this overactivity. However, the mechanisms underlying exercise pressor reflex dysfunction in hypertension are not clear. Sensory information generated by activation of the exercise pressor reflex is processed within the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the medulla oblongata. The activity of neurons within the medulla that receive and process this information can be modulated by the endogenous production of nitric oxide (NO). NO production is mediated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Likewise, NO activity within the NTS can be modified by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, alterations in either NOS expression/activity or ROS production potentially contribute to changes in NO activity within the NTS. As such, the NO pathway within the NTS represents a viable target for disease induced alterations in exercise pressor reflex function. Based on this knowledge, we hypothesize that the enhanced cardiovascular response to exercise mediated by the exercise pressor reflex in hypertension is induced by alterations in NO activity, changes in NOS expression and/or function as well as alterations in the generation of ROS within the NTS. To test these hypotheses, we will perform physiologic and neuro-biochemical studies in normotensive and hypertensive rats to address the following specific aims: 1) determine the role of NO within the NTS in the generation of exercise pressor reflex, mechanoreflex and metaboreflex overactivity in hypertension; 2) determine the role of NOS within the NTS in the generation of exercise pressor reflex, mechanoreflex and metaboreflex overactivity in hypertension; and 3) determine the role of ROS within the NTS in the generation of exercise pressor reflex, mechanoreflex and metaboreflex overactivity in hypertension."
8665,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of obesity is driving a surge in the incidence of associated metabolic diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Indeed, obesity is tightly linked to the development of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and dysfunction. It is believed that, in obese subjects, the supply of fatty acids far exceeds the hepatic capacity for fatty acid oxidation or secretion in lipoproteins. Therefore, a more complete understanding of the pathways that control hepatic lipid homeostasis has important physiological and clinical implications. The capacity for fatty acid catabolism is known to be controlled at the level of gene transcription by a family of nuclear receptor transcription factors, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and their coactivator protein (PGC-1?). PGC-1?? is a highly-inducible coactivator that transcriptionally regulates multiple energy metabolic pathways including mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation. Recently, we generated mice deficient for PGC-1?? (PGC- 1?? -/- mice). Although PGC-1?? -/- mice appeared outwardly normal, hepatocytes from PGC-1?? -/- mice exhibited diminished rates of fatty acid oxidation and fasting-induced steatosis. Gene expression profiling identified the gene encoding lipin 1 as markedly fasting-induced in the liver of wild-type, but not PGC-1?? -/- mice. Lipin 1 gene mutations lead to lipodystrophy and fatty liver in fld mice and hepatocytes from fld mice exhibit perinatal steatosis and diminished rates of palmitate oxidation. Our preliminary data indicate that lipin 1 augments the activity of the PPAR?? /PGC-1?? system and increases the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that lipin 1 plays an important role in controlling lipid homeostasis via transcriptional regulation of genes involved in hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, we postulate that lipin 1 mediates many of these effects via interactions with PGC-1?? and its partner transcription factors. This proposal is designed to [1] characterize the functional interaction between lipin 1 and PGC-1??, [2] elucidate the transcriptional effects of lipin 1 on hepatic fatty acid metabolism using complimentary gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, and [3] to evaluate the effects of constitutive lipin 1 activation on the development of NAFLD in mouse models. The increasing prevalence of obesity is driving a surge in the incidence of associated metabolic diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We believe that understanding how a protein called lipin 1 impacts fatty acid metabolism may be important for the development of new therapies to treat patients with NAFLD."
8686,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three neural pathways carry information from the retina to cortex: the parvocellular (PC) and magnocellular (MC) pathways, driven by the dense arrays of long (L-) and medium (M-) wave-sensitive cone cells, and the koniocellular (KC) pathway, driven by differences between the L- and M- cone signals and signals from the sparser array of short-wave- sensitive (S) cones. Relatively little is known about the KC pathway but it appears to be an independent, rapid and developmentally-robust input to visual cortex. We will ask three questions about this pathway: (1) When and where do KC pathway signals reach cortex? (2) How do KC signals interact with luminance and chromatic signals from the other pathways? (3) Does the KC pathway play a privileged role in the feedback from visual cortex to the thalamus? We will use a tightly-integrated combination of fMRI, high-density EEG and psychophysics to address these questions in humans. We will use fMRI to map visual areas in each subject. We will then use high-density EEG and distributed source imaging to study KC signals in those visual areas with high temporal resolution. We will also use fMRI to measure KC signals in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Finally, we will use psychophysics to measure the perceptual correlates of these signals. Answers to these questions will elucidate the normal function of the early visual system. They will also shed light on the visual deficits caused by retinal diseases that cause early degeneration of S-cones. These include glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, diabetes, and HIV-related vision loss. Finally, because of its unusual properties (rapid input to lateral cortex, lack of plasticity during long-term visual deprivation), the KC pathway may represent an important alternative target for vision restoration therapies including stem cell therapy and visual prostheses. Understanding the type of information that can be transmitted to cortex through this pathway is therefore of considerable interest."
8692,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many physiological processes function efficiently within a well-controlled pH range and significant deviations from this range typically are indicative of pathologic conditions. Within cells, maintenance of a pH gradient in different organelles allows for differential  activation of certain enzymes or generation of active conformations of proteins for transient or prolonged activity. Globally, the sum of cellular events can reflect on the pH of tissues and organ systems. A common strategy to monitor the pH of biochemical events relies on the use of pH-sensitive fluorescent molecular probes to monitor diverse physiological and pathological processes, including studies related to cancer, cell proliferation, endocytotic and other physiological processes. Currently, there is a major disconnection between the use of pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes in molecular cell biology and for imaging diseases in vivo. This is because most of these dyes fluoresce in the visible wavelengths where absorption of light by native fluorophores and autofluorescence limits their use in both tissue and cell imaging. To overcome these problems, we propose to develop new classes of pH-sensitive near infrared fluorescent molecular probes that are useful for imaging molecular processes by microscopy and whole-body animal imaging by diffuse optical tomography. Advantages of this approach include high detection sensitivity because of low autofluorescence, low phototoxicity  because of the use of low energy radiation, and the extension of the spectral window to the 900 nm which allows the use of multiple fluorophores between 400 and 900 nm wavelengths. More importantly, information gleaned from the molecular cell biology studies can be translated to small animals, and eventually to humans with the same pHsensitive NIR molecular probe because NIR light can penetrate into deep tissues. We will accomplish these goals by (1) designing and developing two new classes of pHsensitive NIR dyes; (2) demonstrating their utility to image pH-dependent molecular processes in cells; and (3) imaging the onset of acidosis in solid tumors in vivo. The products generated from this project will be distributed to other investigators for research purposes. Project Narrative The goals of this project are to (1) design and develop two new classes of pH-sensitive NIR dyes; (2) demonstrate their utility to image pH-dependent molecular processes in cells by microscopy; and (3) image the onset of acidosis in solid tumors in vivo. The technology platform developed will be useful for diverse pH-based biological applications."
8695,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacillus subtilis and many other bacteria can be transformed by exogenous DNA when in a physiological state known as competence. Competent cells can bind DNA, fragment it on the cell surface and transport a single strand of DNA across the membrane. Once internalized, the single strand can integrate at a homologous site on the recipient chromosome. Our long-term objective is to understand these processes on the molecular level, by characterizing the 20 proteins involved and their interactions with one another and with DNA. We have shown that transformation takes place mostly at the cell poles. This proposal explores the interactions among many of the competence proteins, as well as their localization and delocalization as polar complexes. The recently discovered role of McsA and McsB in delocalization will be explored. We will also detect contacts between these proteins and DNA at various stages in the transformation process and determine the cellular addresses at which the contacts occur. The structure, composition and role of the competence pseudopilus will be explored. The sources of energy driving the transport of transforming DNA will be identified. Genetic screens will be used to find two competence proteins that have not been identified; the nuclease that degrades the non-transforming strand, and a second cell surface DNA binding protein. Transformation provides a mechanism for the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes among pathogens. Understanding the mechanism of gene transfer by transformation will provide insights into these important processes. Many bacteria can accept DNA from the environment in a process known as transformation. This provides a mechanism for the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes among pathogens. Understanding this process of gene transfer by transformation will provide insights into these important processes."
8716,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is currently thought to be a complex genetic disorder, with altered neuronal development, perhaps very early in life, important in determining vulnerability. Neurogenesis and neurodevelopment occur in the adult olfactory epithelium, and probes of the olfactory system may provide insights into the neuro-biological basis of altered neurodevelopment in this disorder. Indeed, studies of patients with schizophrenia have demonstrated robust behavioral, structural, and functional impairments of the olfactory system. Our work, along with others', has indicated that olfactory brain regions are affected by both neurodegenerative and genetically-mediated neurodevelopmental processes. This project represents the only systematic effort to examine the underpinnings of these chemosensory impairments from a life-span perspective. To date, our efforts have established that: 1)pervasive and stable olfactory deficits exist across the lifespan in schizophrenia; 2)no significant medication effects are seen; 3)similar psychophysical, structural, and functional deficits exist in first-degree relatives of patients; and 4)underlying facial structures such as nasal and palate volumes are abnormal. Over early fetal life, cerebral morphogenesis proceeds in embryological intimacy with craniofacial morphogenesis. As such, quantitative analysis of craniofacial and cerebral dysmorphology along with a detailed psychophysical assessment of the olfactory system may provide important information concerning the developmental origins of schizophrenia. In this application, we propose an in-depth assessment of the structural and functional abnormalities of the olfactory system from an early neurodevelopmental perspective. We will study 40 schizophrenia patients, 40 otherwise healthy first-degree family members, 40 unrelated healthy controls, and 40 high-risk subjects who present with early symptoms of psychosis. New methods will be utilized to examine the neurodevelopmental contributions to chemosensory dysfunction in patients including nasal/palate volume, structural MRI, and quantitative examination of facial morphology. Predictive utility of these impairments will be probed by examining subjects at increased risk for the development of psychosis. Our working model is that olfactory impairment reflects developmentally disturbed processes of neurogenesis and synapse formation and that these measures may represent specific markers of embryological dysmorphogenesis underlying schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is currently thought to be a complex genetic disorder, with early developmental abnormalities in brain structure and function, being important in determining vulnerability to illness. This study will examine changes in smell abilities in schizophrenia along with detailed measurements of the nasal and oral cavities and mapping of facial and brain structure and topography. We believe that robust olfactory impairment seen in patients reflects a disturbance of an early developmental process and that the analysis of these functions and structures may provide important information concerning the developmental origins of schizophrenia."
8732,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart cell therapy using stem cells with myogenic and angiogenic potential or cytokine induced mobilization of bone marrow cells (BMCs) to the site of injury has shown promise. Similarly, ischemic and pharmacological preconditioning has cardioprotective effects. These therapeutic modalities have been adopted to promote de novo myocardial regeneration and reversal of deleterious hemodynamic effects after myocardial infarction (MI). In order to achieve these effects the present study involves transplantation of BMCs together with skeletal myoblasts (SkMs) which will serve mainly as carries of therapeutic genes. Our main hypothesis is that preconditioning and re-programming of cells prior to transplantation would enhance their survival, engraftment and efficacy for cardiac repair. The main aims of our study are; Aim-1) Preconditioning of donor cells for their enhanced survival after transplantation. We posit that treatment of cells by preconditioning mimetics may enhance their tolerance to ischemia via stimulation of cell survival signaling. The preconditioned (PC) cells will also exhibit paracrine effects which will give enhanced host myocyte survival in the infarcted heart. Aim-2) Intramyocardial delivery of non-virally transfected SkMs overexpressing SDF-11 along with transient cytokine therapy for BMCs mobilization for improved heart function. We hypothesized that the elevated SDF-11 levels in the heart will attract circulating CXCR4+ BMCs, egress of which from BM will be distinctly increased after cytokine therapy, to participate in the repair process by angiomyogenesis in the ischemic heart. Aim-3: To activate cytoprotective regulatory pathways in donor SkMs before transplantation. Considering a critical role for Akt and Bcl-2 in cell survival and angiogenesis downstream of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1)/Tie-2 signaling pathway, we hypothesize that transplantation of SkMs co-overexpressing Ang-1 and Akt or Bcl-2 will give increased cell survival, enhanced angiogenesis, and improved cardiac function. Aim-4 will focus on in vitro re-programming of donor cells for directed differentiation via co-culture with cardiomyocytes to adopt cardiac phenotype after transplantation. The co-culture derived cells will show better engraftment and transdifferentiation after transplantation. Put together, our combined therapeutic approach for preconditioning and re-programming of donor cells before transplantation is expected to give better prognosis in the treatment of ischemically injured myocardium."
8758,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal changes in colonic smooth muscle tone and motility are pathological indicators of GI disorders. However the relationship between muscle tone, enteric neural activity and propulsion is unclear. The release of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters regulates tone of both the longitudinal (LM) and circular muscle (CM) layers. It is generally unappreciated that muscle tone itself can alter activity in the enteric nervous system. Our novel preliminary findings suggest that both tone dependent and tone independent (stretch activated) motility patterns exist, but these motor activities are different in proximal and distal isolated colon. These different motor patterns will provide us with an important window of opportunity to dissect out, for the first time, the tone dependent and independent neural circuitry underlying colonic motor activity. We demonstrate that these motor patterns appear to be regulated by two different intrinsic sensor/neurons: IPANS {AH-neurons) that are sensitive to muscle tone and contraction and ascending interneurons whose activity is stretch dependent but independent of muscle tone. Therefore, sensory transduction in the ENS is analogous to that in the somatic nervous system where Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles provide complementary information regarding muscle tension and muscle length respectively. Furthermore, we show that the sensory processes of these two neurons appear to be located within the CM but not the LM. We will use the isolated guinea-pig proximal and distal colon, to determine: AIM 1: how stretch activates muscle tone dependent and tone independent neural reflex pathways that underlie propulsive activities in proximal and distal colon.  AIM 2: the extent of activation of LM cells and myenteric neurons around the circumference of the colon during stretch induced motor reflexes. AIM 3: whether the LM or CM is necessary for sensory transduction underlying motor activities in the large intestine. AIM 4: the role and firing patterns of myenteric AH and S neurons and submucosal neurons in colonic motor activities. Several new techniques will be used, which indclude: 1) Simultaneous intracellular recordings from LM or CM cells and from myenteric or submucosal neurons. 2) Video imaging of movements of the gut wall. 3) Calcium imaging of neurons and muscle. 4) Intracellular recording from Dil retrogradely labeled mechanosensitive ascending interneurons."
8819,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modification of cysteine residues by nitric oxide changes the function of a broad spectrum of proteins. This protein modification represents a physiological signaling mechanism, termed S- nitrosylation, that has been proposed to be analogous to phosphorylation. It regulates many of the bioactivities of inflammatory cells and other cells relevant to pulmonary biology. However, unlike phosphorylation, the regulation of S-nitrosylation signaling is poorly understood. In our previous project, we studied the metabolic regulation in the airway of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous bronchodilator and S-nitrosylating agent. We have now accomplished most of the aims of this project. Indeed, GSNO is now entering clinical trials as an inhalational therapy. However, critical questions remain regarding human airway S-nitrosothiol metabolism as it relates to specific molecular targets in the lung. For example, we and others have shown that the airway epithelial expression of the enzyme, GSNO reductase, is an important determinant of airway hyper-responsiveness in animal models of asthma. Moreover, we have found evidence that the GSNO breakdown product, S-nitroso-L-cysteine, causes stereoselective, cyclic GMP-independent smooth muscle relaxation through S-nitrosylation of myosin. Further, several investigators have reported that GSNO can regulate the function and intracellular trafficking of proteins relevant to lung disease, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulatory protein. We have developed novel techniques for measuring cellular S-nitrosothiols. In the current project, we will apply these novel techniques to study, in human airway tissue, 1) the regulation of GSNO reductase expression (Aim 1); 2) the effect of GSNO reductase and other S-nitrosothiol regulatory enzymes on smooth muscle function (Aim 2); and 3) the effect of S-nitrosothiol regulatory enzymes on the metabolism and trafficking of S-nitrosothiol-modified proteins in epithelial cells, particularly in the context of GSNO therapy (Aim 3). We believe that our publication record and preliminary data suggest that we can accomplish these aims in the proposed time frame. Further, our data also suggest that these aims are innovative, scientifically sound and of potential relevance to the treatment of asthma and cystic fibrosis. Project Narrative: Our project is focused on the pulmonary metabolism of signaling molecules known as S-nitrosothiols. We have found evidence that abnormal S-nitrosothiol metabolism in the airway may help to explain airway narrowing in many patients with asthma. Further, it turns out that understanding this metabolism is likely to be important for the development of certain new therapies for asthma and cystic fibrosis."
8832,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this proposal is to address a significant gap in the prevention literature about the development of substance use and related problems for Latino youth. The Latino population is the fastest growing ethnic subgroup in the U.S., yet our scientific understanding about mechanisms of risk and protection in the population has lagged far behind the growth rate. While epidemiological data support that Latino youth are at no greater risk for substance use than the general youth population, some data indicate that they might be at greater risk for problems that co-occur with substance use (e.g., school failure, incarceration, poor health). Foreign-born Latino youngsters seem to be at particular risk for such problems, and there is growing evidence that risk for substance use initiation and abuse for Latino youth grows substantially as they become more acculturated to the U.S. society. Theoretical models suggest that acculturation processes along with other contextual factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, social support processes) exert their effects on youngster adjustment indirectly, by impacting more proximal variables (i.e., parenting practices). Strong theoretical foundations in the literature have led to the development and testing of a host of interventions designed to ameliorate potential deleterious effects of acculturation for Latino youngsters. Yet, the empirical basis underlying the theory and applied intervention work is sparse. In fact, few empirical studies have been conducted that examine how changes in acculturation processes unfold over time to predict outcomes for families at different stages in the process. The current study will help fill this gap by examining the developmental pathways towards substance use and related problems for 225 recently immigrated Latino families. The prospective, longitudinal design will employ multiple methods and agents to assess family process variables cross-sectionally across up to a 14-year time in residency period, and allows for longitudinal examination of individual family trajectories across a three-year adjustment period. The aims are to: (1) examine the longitudinal effects of acculturation processes, social contexts, and social support processes on family environment, parenting practices, and youth substance use and related problems for immigrant Latino families; (2) examine the effects of years in U.S. residency on the relationship between acculturation processes and the development of youngster substance use and related problems for immigrant Latino families; and (3) test an integrative theoretical model based on social interaction learning theory that specifies mediating effects of family environment and parenting practices on the relationships between macrosystem and exosystem factors (i.e., acculturation processes, social contexts, and social support processes) and substance use and related problems for immigrant Latino youth and their families."
8847,HHS,NSF,"Abundant evidence suggests that the depletion of estrogen in postmenopausal women is a significant risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a normal consequence of aging, men also exhibit depletion of their primary sex steroid hormone, testosterone. The reduction in men's androgen levels is manifested clinically as impaired function in numerous androgen-sensitive tissues throughout the body, including the brain. Based on recent evidence from our laboratory, we propose that two neural functions of androgens are promotion of neuron viability and regulation of beta-amyloid protein (A-beta). We predict that impairment of these androgen functions occurring as a result of normal, age-related androgen depletion will place the brain at increased risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims that utilize complementary cell culture, animal model, and human subjects paradigms. In the Aim 1, we will investigate our hypothesis that androgens are endogenous regulators of neuron viability.  Proposed studies will assess the role of androgen receptor in neuroprotection as well as elucidate the responsible downstream signaling cascades. Further, we will examine how age-related androgen depletion affects neuronal vulnerability to injury. In Aim 2, we investigate the hypothesized role of androgens as endogenous modulators of AE, levels. By experimental manipulation of androgen status in animal models, we will evaluate our hypothesis that androgen depletion will result in increased levels of A-beta.  Mechanistic studies will evaluate the contributions of androgen receptor activation and androgen regulation of A- beta-catabolizing enzymes. Together, we anticipate that Aims 1 and 2 will establish that androgens have beneficial, protective actions in brain and that androgen depletion places the brain at risk for degeneration and disease. In Aim 3, we will further evaluate this hypothesis by both investigating how manipulation of androgen status affects progression of AD-like neuropathology in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. and examining the relationships between human aging, brain levels of A-beta and androgens, and AD status. Together, we believe these novel and timely studies will begin an important evaluation of interactions between normal male aging events, neuroprotection, A-beta regulation, and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease."
8885,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is to examine breaks in DNA that occur during the process of immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR). CSR is the process by which B lymphocytes exchange the constant region of the immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule they produce in order to most effectively combat the pathogen to which they have been exposed. CSR involves a recombination event in which the IgM constant region gene is deleted and replaced by a downstream constant region gene such as C?. The recombination occurs within DNA located upstream of each constant region gene known as switch (S) regions. As the intervening DNA is excised as a circle, the process requires that double strand breaks are made in both the upstream and downstream S regions. DNA breaks can lead to mutations, translocations and tumors and therefore must be tightly regulated. It is known that activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for this process and that it can deaminate cytidines in DNA to generate uracils that can be mutagenic and/or lead to DNA breaks.  The experiments proposed here will determine if AID acts directly on Ig S region DNA in vivo to convert  cytidines to uracils and also will determine the subsequent steps that lead to break formation. Ligation-mediated (LM)-PCR will be used to detect the exact breakpoint in S region DNA and to test the hypothesis that the breaks instigated by AID activity are initially single-stranded and staggered double strand breaks (DSBs), but that end-processing by DNA repair enzymes can convert some of these breaks to blunt DSBs. The position and structure of breaks will be examined in cells from mice deficient in DNA repair proteins from the mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and base excision repair (BER) pathways. The BER enzymes UNG and APE can remove uracil from DNA and nick the DNA backbone and are thought to be involved in break formation. Enzymes from the BER pathway will be used to treat genomic DNA from B cells induced to switch in order to detect intermediates in the repair pathway that are predicted by this model."
8911,HHS,HHS,"The overall goal of this Program Project is to develop a multicomponent vaccine for T.cruzi infection and define the optimal means and methods to distribute such a vaccine. During the previous grant period, a heavy emphasis was placed on putting together the infrastructure to test most T.cruzi genes for vaccine efficacy. That infrastructure is now well established and is functioning at high efficacy. The goals of Project 1: Gene Annotation and Cloning, is to keep the machine for gene identification and cloning running, to continue to fine-tune the process and to clone all T.cruzi genes of interest. We will rely on the Bioinformatic core and the T.cruzi Genome Sequencing Consortium (TcGSC) for gene identification and will also use the information derived from the proteomics studies described in Project 2 for identifying and prioritizing genes for cloning and testing. The primary criteria for selection of genes for cloning include: 1) presence in a relatively low number of alleles or variants in the genome, 2) expression in parasites stages that are present in the mammalian host, and 3) presence in the appropriate compartments to serve as effective targets for immune recognition. Genes identified as being as being of interest will be passed on to the Cloning Pipeline in which putative genes are cloned by means of automated primer design, and initial and secondary PCR reactions for the production of adapter sites required for cloning into Gateway entry vectors. Genes are then moved into vaccination vectors for testing in mice. We will clone and test a minimum of 1000 genes per year- and we predict that at this rate we can cover the majority of low copy genes in the T.cruzi genome. Genes will be tested in pools of approximately 96 for the ability to protect mice from lethal infection and protective pools will be further parsed to eventually determine the individual genes that provide the best protection. Genes cloned in this process will be used to produce and test protective cocktails of genes in the vaccination studies described in Project 3."
8920,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The re-emergence of tuberculosis as a public health problem has been complicated by the lack of effective chemotherapeutic agents and the development of drug-resistant strains. The cell wall of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is known to be the target of some of the most effective anti-mycobacterial drugs including ethambutol which is known to inhibit the biosynthesis of the arabinan of cell wall arabinogalactan (AG) and the associated lipoarabinomannan (LAM). A diverse range of biological studies over the past few years has collectively provided compelling evidence implicating LAM as a key surface molecule in host-pathogen interactions. The availability of truncated, mutated LAM variants as a consequence of drug resistance and genetic manipulation provides invaluable model compounds for both structural and functional studies aiming at defining the relevance of LAM in pathogenesis. Specifically, the fine details of the arabinan assembly and its point(s) of attachment to the phosphatidylinositol mannan core will be characterized and structural niceties positively correlating with particular biological attributes of clinical isolates will be identified. Structural basis of microheterogeneity in LAM will be defined and chemically and/or enzymatically modified arabinan and mannan will be derived from LAM for structural/biological studies. As a major spin off, the recent availability of the consequential cell wall mutants due to genetic manipulation of the embCAB proteins, and analyses of the gene products now allows us rationally to dissect the pathway to the formation of the arabinan of LAM/AG. In the same vein, studies on LAM mutants in M. tuberculosis and our concerted efforts on generating LAM depleted M. tuberculosis will contribute directly into addressing the role of LAM in survival/infectivity of the organism. Thus, the unifying theme of this Research Proposal encompasses structural analysis and manipulation of LAM, supplemented by genetic probes to alter its structure and mutate LAM in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis all in relation to biology and biosynthesis."
8939,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), are widely used as models of disease pathogenesis in humans and for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics against microbial pathogens, including emerging diseases and potential bioterror pathogens. The ability to interpret the results of these studies is hampered by a limited capacity to accurately quantitate their cellular immune responses. This proposal is focused on developing technology and tools to evaluate cell-mediated immunity in Chinese-origin rhesus macaques and Cynomolgus macaques. Our strategy relies on the identification of common major histocompatibility (MHC) class I alleles, determining their peptide binding motifs, developing bioinformatic tools to predict MHC:peptide interactions, and validating our approach by the identification of Lassa virus, Marburg virus and influenza-derived epitopes. In Specific Aim 1, we will define peptide binding motifs for five common MHC class I molecules each from Cynomolgus macaques and Chinese rhesus macaques. Common A and B loci MHC class I allele frequency data in animal cohorts available for use in experimental research will be provided by collaborators and data generated in-house. A stable transfectant will be produced for each of the five most frequently expressed MHC allele studied, allowing the production and purification of soluble MHC. We will then establish quantitative peptide:MHC peptide binding assays and determine allele specific MHC binding motifs. This quantitative MHC:peptide binding data will be used for algorithm development. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop and make MHC:peptide prediction algorithms available to the scientific community. The large amount of binding data obtained as a result of Specific Aim 1 will be utilized to generate algorithms to predict the MHC binding capacity of peptides. These tools will permit rapid predictions of potential Chinese-origin and Cynomolgus macaque epitopes from any Category A-C pathogen of interest. All binding data and algorithms will be submitted to the Immune Epitope Database, thereby making these tools freely available to the scientific community. In Specific Aim 3, we will experimentally validate our approach in the Lassa, Marburg and influenza virus model systems. We will test the immunogenicity of epitopes derived from Lassa, Marburg and influenza viruses identified in the course of the studies performed in Specific Aim 1 and 2. We now extended our efforts to encompass not only Lassa virus, as proposed in the original submission, but also Marburg and influenza viruses due to improvements in the quality of our computational algorithms. These studies will be performed in collaboration with collaborators. These experiments will validate the approach and tools developed and also identify epitopes that can be utilized to monitor responses in these A-C pathogen systems.    Project Narrative: Rhesus macaques and Cynomolgus macaques are widely used as models of disease pathogenesis in humans and for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics against microbial pathogens, including emerging diseases and potential bioterror pathogens.

8940,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The innate and adaptive immune systems are irrevocably linked and both play primary roles in the induction and/or prevention of infections, including periodontal disease. Critical to the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses to microbial antigens is the participation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a family of pattern- recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect conserved molecular products of microorganisms. We propose that the immune regulation exerted by the innate immune system upon its interaction with virulence antigens is the basis for the development of therapies geared to manipulate the effector immune response to the advantage and protection of the host. The fundamental hypothesis of our studies is that each microbial antigen is unique in its initial interaction with the host, thus resulting in differences in receptor recognition, activation of signaling pathways and cellular responses. In this regard, we have shown differences in the adaptive immune responses to the hemagglutinin/adhesin virulence antigens Kgp-HArep and HagB derived from Porphyromonas ginigivalis, which suggest that their interactions with the innate immune system differ. We plan to focus our investigations on the TLRs and on dendritic cells since these antigen-presenting cells have the exquisite property of activating na¿ve T cells and thus are critically involved in innate and adaptive responses. In addition, our investigations will pursue an understanding of the ensuing adaptive immune response. Therefore, the aims of this proposal are (1) to determine the role of TLRs in the innate and adaptive response to Kgp-HArep and HagB stimulation; (2) to determine if innate and effector cell responses to Kgp- HArep and HagB require lipid rafts and how the induction of a specific effector response or the use of a certain TLR affects the particular recruitment and concentration of signaling molecules into lipid rafts; and (3) to determine the role of CD25+CD4+ Treg cells in immune responses to Kgp-HArep and HagB and in P. gingivalis infection. It is anticipated that these studies will lead to an understanding of the cellular events that occur when host cells encounter the virulence antigens HArep and HagB, and will provide 1) insight into their role in pathogenesis/immunity and 2) relavant information for the development of vaccines or therapies that will specifically protect or ameliorate infections by the pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major etiologic agent of periodontal disease. This inflammatory disease is widespread and associations have been made between this disease and serious systemic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. Since the immunoregulatory properties of P. gingivalis antigens in host responses are poorly understood, it becomes critical to understand the host cellular responses, including the signaling pathways activated, to major antigens of P. gingivalis, in order to develop novel therapies and vaccines by which periodontal disease can be ameliorated or controlled."
8948,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates the degree to which higher rates of health problems among race/ethnic minority children of all economic strata and among poor children from all race/ethnic populations prior to the start of elementary school put them at an academic disadvantage once elementary school has begun. Because health is a policy amenable developmental factor and the transition to elementary school is a critical intervention point in the educational career, such research provides leverage in attempts to address the persistent, overlapping race/ethnic and economic gaps in educational attainment in the early life course that forecast increasing inequalities in social mobility, morbidity, and mortality in adulthood. Drawing on a classic theoretical perspective that targets the development processes surrounding the transition into elementary school as fundamental to demographic disparities in educational attainment, this project puts forward and tests a conceptual model positing that the poorer physical and mental health of African-American and Latino/a children (controlling for economic status) and of economically disadvantaged children (controlling for race/ethnicity) in the pre-school years contribute to their lower rates of academic achievement in school. Importantly, this project will also explore the mechanisms underlying the academic risks of early health problems and identify aspects of family organization, pre-school programs, elementary school classrooms, and home-school partnerships that protect against these academic risks in general and in traditionally disadvantaged populations in particular. A team of population scientists working with senior consultants from medicine, developmental psychology, and social work will conduct this research. Specifically, this team will apply multi-level, growth curve, and propensity score techniques to two NIH-funded data sets the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study, which oversamples the disadvantaged side of the socioeconomic spectrum of American families, and the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, which oversamples the more advantaged side and then supplement this quantitative investigation with analysis of qualitative data to be collected from teachers and parents in a low-income, racially diverse elementary school. This interdisciplinary, theoretically grounded, mixed-methods investigation is specifically designed to elucidate the role of child health in the reproduction of overlapping systems of race/ethnic and economic stratification in ways that directly inform social policy.This project delves into a timely and significant public health issue: the contribution of the connection between health problems and academic struggles in early childhood to the race/ethnic and economic stratification of American society. The main goals are to determine a means by which demographic inequalities are transmitted across generations in ways that affect population rates of morbidity and mortality and then to identify potential policy-amenable remedies to this process."
8968,HHS,HHS,"The goal of our research is to elucidate the mechanisms that establish cAMP compartmentation incontrolling signaling specificity as well as determine the functional importance of cAMP microdomains.cAMP mediates many cellular processes by coupling to downstream effectors such as cAMP dependentprotein kinase (PKA) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac). Because cAMP is producedat distinct subcellular sites and diffuses rapidly throughout the cell, mechanisms must regulate signalpropagation in order to achieve a desired cellular response. However, only recently have tools becomeavailable to effectively explore these mechanisms of control. Impaired cAMP signaling has clinicalimplications such as obesity and type II diabetes. Therefore, a better understanding of cAMP signaling maylead to new therapeutic approaches for these clinical conditions.

8973,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The saliva of blood-sucking arthropod vectors for disease contains molecules that have either potent pharmacological or immunosuppressive effects. These molecules aid the vector in obtaining a blood meal and these molecules also inadvertently enhance the infectivity of the pathogens that these vectors transmit (arthropods probe in the skin for a blood meal and can deliver pathogens to the skin within their saliva). The saliva of the sand fly (the vector for leishmaniasis) dramatically exacerbates infection with Leishmania in mice and can determine whether Leishmania is able to successfully establish infection in the host. These observations suggested that it may be possible to vaccinate humans against vector-borne diseases by vaccinating against the molecules in vector saliva that allow the pathogen to establish infection in the host. It is now clear maxadilan (MAX) in the saliva of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis has dual functions: it is a potent vasodilator and also a modulator of the immune response. It mediates these effects via interaction with the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor and affects various functions of macrophages. MAX substitutes for whole saliva and exacerbates infection with Leishmania to the same extent as whole saliva. We have also produced a protein-based vaccine with MAX and have shown that it can induce profound protection in mice against challenge with Leishmania plus whole saliva. This application will explore the effects of MAX on the immune system, extend and refine our vaccine formulations against MAX and produce improved sand fly-based vaccines that utilize MAX and possibly other salivary targets. In addition, the application will explore the relevance of our findings with MAX in a mouse model to human model systems to determine whether MAX affects human cells as it does mouse cells and to what extent humans mount an immune response to MAX and other salivary molecules. Arthropods transmit some of the most serious diseases in the world (malaria, dengue, Lyme, West Nile, and many many more) and new arthropod-borne diseases emerge frequently. Moreover, because of bioterrorism, we station more and more troops in areas endemic for arthropod-borne diseases. There are currently no effective ways to control these diseases. New and effective methods (especially novel vaccine approaches such as the one described here) are sorely needed."
8988,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite strong decreases in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality over past decades, there is evidence that racial and socioeconomic disparities in CHD mortality are increasing. CHD surveillance efforts that examine trends within these population subgroups are an important first step in quantifying and reducing disparities. Yet, only one U.S. population-based CHD surveillance study includes black populations and none has monitored trends by socioeconomic status (SES). The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study has monitored rates and trends in validated hospitalized myocardial infarction and fatal CHD among black and white adults aged 35 to 74 years in four U.S. communities since 1989. The proposed study will expand the scope of ARIC surveillance by examining variations in the rates and temporal trends in CHD by SES, measured at the level of census tract. For CHD events already included in ARIC surveillance (1992- 2002), addresses will be obtained from medical records and death certificates and geocoded so that they can be matched with identifiers for census based geographical areas. The ARIC study will contribute yearly updates of abstracted CHD events and addresses for subsequent years (2003-2005). Each event will be linked with census tract level SES indicators available from the 1990 and 2000 censuses. This novel effort will permit an examination of disparities by SES in rates and trends in fatal CHD, hospitalized myocardial infarction, case fatality, use of invasive cardiac procedures and prescription of efficacious medication at time of hospital discharge. In addition, the extent to which racial disparities in CHD and associated treatments are explained by SES will also be explored. This study would be the first U.S. population-based CHD surveillance study to include an assessment of variations in the burden of CHD by SES and thus, would provide valuable contributions to the scientific literature. Furthermore, the findings could be used to plan targeted public health interventions aimed at reducing CHD disparities."
8994,HHS,NSF,"The haloalkanoate dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF)is one of the largest and most ubiquitous enzyme families, with over 3,000 members in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. The proposed studies will define, using steady-state and transient-state kinetics, X-ray structure determination, and bioinformatics, the mechanisms of catalysis and substrate recognition in selected HADSF phosphotransferases of biomedical importance. InAim 1the mechanism of catalysis of phosphoryl transfer in beta-phosphoglucomutase will be defined by measuring rate constants for individual steps of the catalytic cycle, identifying residues that stabilize the phosphorane intermediate using wild type and site- directed mutants, determining the mechanism of synchronizing cap closure and acid/base catalysis, and testing the role of cap domain closure in phosphorane formation. In part2 of Aim 1the structure of human alpha-phosphomannomutase will be determined and the roles of individual residues in substrate recognition, enzyme phosphorylation, substrate reorientation, conformational changes, and transition-state stabilization will befound for the wild-type enzyme and mutants clinically correlated with congenital disorders of glycosylation. Aim 2 targets the mechanisms of substrate recognition in two of the three HADSF subfamilies. In part 1, we will provide functional assignment to orphaned structures from the PDB corresponding to HADSF type MB phosphatases using a solvent cage method to identify leads for substrate screening. The apparent functional redundancy in sugar phosphatases within a single species will be probed by determining substrate range in homologs. In part 2, the Type III subfamily bacterial enzymes N-acyl-neuraminate-9-phosphate phosphatase and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate phosphatase will be characterized structurally and in terms of substrate promiscuity in order to define the substrate specificity determinants and find if acid/base catalysis and substrate induced fit are operative."
9015,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycystic kidney disease (PKD), the most common genetic cause of renal failure in humans, is characterized by the accumulation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys and other epithelial organs. Although the genes that cause PKD have been identified, the mechanism of cyst formation remains unclear. Recent studies suggest that PKD may arise from abnormalities of the primary cilium, an immotile, hair-like organelle that project from the apical surface of most renal epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, Cre/loxP recombination was used to delete the Kif3a gene in the kidneys of transgenic mice. Kif3a (Kinesin family 3a) encodes the 80/85-kda subunit of the kinesin-II motor protein that is essential for cilia formation. Kidney-specific deletion of Kif3a results in viable offspring with normal-appearing kidneys at birth. Renal cysts begin to appear at postnatal day (P)5, and renal failure develops by P21. The cyst epithelial cells lack primary cilia and have abnormalities in cell proliferation, apoptosis, polarity, and (-catenin localization. The overall goal of this project is to understand how the loss of renal cilia leads to cyst formation. Inducible Cre/loxP recombination will be used to delete Kif3a in adult mice to test whether the loss of primary cilia in mature renal tubules produces PKD. Cyst epithelial cell lines established from Kif3a mutant mice will be examined for abnormalities in cilia formation, proliferation, and differentiation. The mechanism of increased proliferation will be elucidated, focusing on activation of the beta-catenin signaling pathway. The expression and subcellular localization of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 will be examined, and the phenotype of mice with combined mutations of Kif3a and either Pkd1 or Pkd2 will be studied to determine whether Kif3a is in the same pathway of cyst formation as Pkd1 and Pkd2. Kif3a mutant cells that lack primary cilia will be exposed to fluid shear stress to elucidate the role of renal cilia in the flow-dependent regulation of intracellular calcium. Taken together, the characterization of a new mouse model of PKD promises to advance our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of human cystic diseases and the essential role of primary cilia in regulating cell growth and differentiation."

9053,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The management of type 2 diabetes in the United States is costly, complex, and continues to fall short of evidence-based goals for glycemic, blood pressure, and cholesterol control. Effective interventions to improve management must be grounded in a clear understanding of how care is currently delivered and must overcome barriers to making changes in therapy. Dr. Grant's long-term goal is to become an independent clinical and health services researcher in diabetes care, with a focus on translating evidence-based guidelines into effective clinical management. Aided by advanced coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics, and medical informatics, Dr. Grant will perform a series of analyses using epidemiologic data to assess the impact of complex medical regimens on medication adherence and to define and describe predictors of medical regimen change in patients with diabetes. The clinical insight resulting from these analyses will help inform the design and implementation of a randomized clinical trial to improve diabetes care. This trial will evaluate the impact of linking medication adherence data derived from current pharmacy claims directly to the electronic medical record in order to guide clinical decisions regarding medical therapy. The Specific Aims of this research proposal are:  Specific Aim 1: To assess the impact of complex medical regimens on medication adherence in the treatment of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.  Specific Aim 2: To identify predictors of therapy change among patients with elevated glycemic, blood pressure, or cholesterol levels.  Specific Aim 3: To design and implement an informatics-based randomized controlled trial to improve diabetes risk factor management by providing primary care physicians with pharmacy claims-based adherence data as part of the electronic medical record.  This career development award will allow Dr. Grant to acquire additional research skills and experience under the mentorship of nationally and internationally known researchers in a supportive academic environment. Completing these objectives will enhance his ability to conduct patient-centered research and to achieve his goal of becoming an independent patient-oriented researcher in diabetes care"
9058,HHS,NSF,"Complement receptors CD21/CD35 provide an important link between innate and adaptive immunity bymediating the enhancing effects of complement on B cell activation and memory. On B cells CD21/CD35form a co-receptor along with CD19 and CD81 ; whereas on follicular dendritic cells (FDC) they provide amechanism for antigen retention. In both cases they serve to enhance the effects of antigen on the humoralresponse. The overall goal of this proposal is to clarify how complement receptors participate in the uptake,transport and deposition of antigen within the lymphoid compartment and to dissect the mechanism wherebythey influence differentiation of activated B cells. Three aims are proposed:The first aim will examine the mechanism of uptake, transport and transfer of protein antigen onto FDC inperipheral lymph nodes.The second aim will test the hypothesis that follicular B cells form a synapse with FDCin vitro and vivo andthat co-receptor signaling participates in antigen uptake.The third aim will test the hypothesis that the complement system participates in differentiation of GCB cellsinto antibody secreting cells (BASC) and memoryUnderstanding how the complement system enhances trafficking and uptake of antigen within the lymphoidcompartment and influences B cell differentiation into antibody secreting cells or memory cells is significantas it will not only extend our understanding of these processes but could be valuable in development ofvaccination protocols."
9076,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mycoplasmas are widely distributed in nature and commonly produce diseases of considerable economic impact, yet little information is available concerning mechanisms of pathogenesis and effective methods of control are unavailable. Mycoplasmal species have the smallest known bacterial genomes, and the availability of the genome sequence of at least 7 different species is being used as a measure for determining the minimal gene set for cellular life. But the mycoplasmas are dependent on the animal host to obtain many vital nutrients. The mycoplasmas not only have the tools to be self-replicating organisms, they also are fully equipped for survival in the animal and often cause chronic disease of the respiratory and genital tracts and joints. We propose to exploit mycoplasmas as minimalist systems for studying how pathogens acquire nutrients from their host and combat host defenses for long-term survival. We choose to use Mycoplasma pulmonis as a model organism because it is a natural pathogen of mice, causing murine respiratory mycoplasmosis. Thus, host-pathogen interactions can be explored using a minimalist pathogen and the power of mouse genetics. The expectation is that such studies will have broad impact for understanding host-dependent bacterial pathogens. For Specific Aim 1, we propose to study carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Little is known about mycoplasmal metabolism and its regulation. We believe that the ability to acquire carbohydrates from the animal host is of central importance for in vivo survival of the mycoplasma.  During the funding period of the current award, a transposon library of M. pulmonis has been characterized to reveal mutants in nearly 300 genes. For Specific Aim 2, we propose to identify transposon mutants that fail to survive in the mouse lung. Mutants that do not survive will be characterized further to determine whether their defect is a failure to grow in vivo, to adhere to the epithelium, or to resist host defenses."
9087,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective attention is a cognitive ability that enables the processing of relevant stimuli while minimizing interference from irrelevant and/or distracting events. An overall goal of the research proposed here is to elucidate the neural mechanisms of attentional processes in order to test specific models of voluntary attention and provide basic science information relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of disorders that include deficits of attention. In conjunction with psychophysical measures, event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) will provide high temporal resolution measures of neural activity supporting attentional control and stimulus selection. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be employed to identify the neuroanatomical systems and networks involved in attentional control and selection. This application has three specific aims: (1) Determine how changes in background neural activity in visual cortex during preparatory attention influence selective sensory processing and performance; (2) Determine the role of preparatory attention in establishing the locus of attentional selection during ascending sensory processing; and (3) Determine the mechanisms of target facilitation and distractor inhibition processes in attentional selection. Throughout the proposed research, the combined use of EEG/ERPs and fMRI will provide complementary measures of the time course and functional anatomy of attentional mechanisms."
9125,HHS,NSF,"Mobile cell surface receptors allow a cell to sense its environment and respond to it. For many receptorssignaling is initiated when receptorsare aggregated. Receptoraggregation is brought about whenmultivalent ligands bridge two or more receptorsor when receptorson one cell bind to ligands onanothercell causing the accumulation of receptorsin the contact region. Aggregation of receptors is rapidly followedby phosphorylation of sites on the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors as well as on other proteins. Someof these sites become binding sites for other signaling molecules, which can lead to the formation of largeprotein complexes, while other sites of phosphorylation regulate protein function. Because proteins can bemodified at multiple sites and can combine in multiple ways, the number of possible distinct proteincomplexes that may participate in a cell signaling cascade can be huge ¿ a phenomenon calledcombinational complexity. We have created software that can automatically handle combinatorial complexityand used it to build a detailed model of the initial signaling events mediated by FctRI, a key receptor inallergic reactions. This model contains the reactions involving a bivalent ligand, FcsRI,two kinases, Lyn andSyk, and a pool of phosphatases. The model predicts how the expression levels of these proteins affect thestrength of signaling, enabling comparisonwith clinical data on the levels of protein expression invariouseffector cells. Building on this work we will extend the model, adding the kinases, Fyn,which associates withFcERI, and Csk, which regulates the activity of Lyn and Fyn, as well as Csk-binding protein, a Lyn substratethat regulates Csk. In addition we will add LAT, Grb2 and Sos1, which form extended complexes posing amajor computational challenge. Working closely with experimental collaborators we will add additionalcomponents as needed. The models we develop serve to rigorously test ideas about biological mechanisms,aid in analyzing experiments, determine parameter values, suggest new experiments and identifiy possiblesites for therapeutic intervention. With the experience we have gained from modeling FceRI signaling we willbuild mechanistic models of two other Fc receptors, FcyRllb which, when co-crosslinked with FceRI, acts asan inhibitory receptor and FcyRllla, the receptor on Natural Killer cells that mediates antibody-dependentcell-mediated cytotoxicity. The work we propose is health related, bearing on allergic disease and on themode of action of monoclonal antibodies and immunoadhesinsthat are used as drugs to target tumor cellsand cells driving autoimmune diseases."
9130,HHS,NSF,"This report describes the progress of the research performed during the first 3.5 years of the R37 award.The research has focused on the protective and cytotoxic actions of nitric oxide in liver cells in twointerrelated aims. Under Aim I we proposed to determine how cellular redox status regulates the chemicalfate and function of nitric oxide in hepatocytes. We have shown that the consequences of NO exposure onhepatocytes dependent on cell redox stress. We have also partially characterized denitrosation activityinliver cells. We have discoveredthat the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) translocates to theperoxisome in hepatocytes. This enzyme exhibits decreasedspecific activity. This may be a mechanism toshuttle dysfunctional enzyme out of the cell. Under Aim II we determine how cyclic nucleotides preventapoptosis. We have shown that cGMP and cAMP block the proximal events in apoptotic signaling.Furthermore, we have begun to explore novel and important areas in our research. Specifically, we havedemonstrated that FADD levels increase dramatically in response to apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, wehave demonstrated that death inducing signaling complex (DISC) components translocate to themitochondria during apoptotic signaling. TNF receptor also translocates to the mitochondria following TNFstimulation. These observations are described in the progress report. We also detail our plans to pursuethese novel findings in the future."
9135,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroscientists acquire single-channel, multichannel, and spatiotemporal data in ever-increasing quantities and need high-quality software tools for preprocessing, exploration, and analysis. Such tools are critical to addressing pressing neuroscientific questions, such as the nature of the neural code and the role of correlated activity of many neurons in perception and behavior. While several groups have developed related tools for internal use, there is currently no software system suitable for multiple data types and formats, usable for large volumes of data, with high-quality numerics, and professionally documented and maintained. Such a software system would enhance neuroscience research by (a) providing access to advanced analytical tools to groups that lack the resources to create them internally, (b) reducing the duplication of effort across groups, (c) allowing for a fuller utilization of physiological data sets, and (d) improving the communication of results between groups. Over the past five years, precisely such a set of tools have been developed by the PI and colleagues. These are in use in over 24 laboratories worldwide for research, in the Neuroinformatics course at the Marine Biological Laboratories for pedagogy, and have led to over 25 publications. In response to many requests, demonstrated by the approximately 24 appended letters, the aim of this grant is the continued development, maintenance and distribution of Chronux, an open source software package for advanced analysis of neurobiological time series data. Specific aims are: 1. Further development and maintenance of a numerical analysis library. Initial emphasis will be on electrophysiological data, both spikes and continuous signals (EEG/MEG/LFP), but later releases will provide routines specialized for image time series data. 2. Incorporation of an I/O library for multiple neurobiological data and metadata formats, consisting of a set of filters to a number of existing formats, along with a general specification for such filters. 3. Development of a graphical user interface, to facilitate use by the typical neuroscientist. 4. Documentation, distribution, maintenance and quality assurance for Chronux. We will work closely with approximately 24 laboratories and the Neuroinformatics course at the MBL via a feedback process to ensure the quality and usability of Chronux."
9168,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the USA, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has risen more than 350% since 1974 while long-term survival rates have remained at 10-15%. Current staging methods are inadequate for predicting survival in this disease, as evidenced by the fact that even patients with early stage, potentially resectable tumors frequently recur and die. Since treatment options are based on pathologic stage, clinicians need improved staging methods to assist in appropriate treatment planning for these patients. Our previously published reports indicate that disease recurrence and poor survival in esophageal cancer patients may be predicted, in part, by the presence of occult metastases to lymph nodes. Recently however, Beer et al. reported in Nature Medicine that gene expression patterns in primary tumors can predict outcome in stage I lung cancer patients. In addition, three new reports in Nature Genetics and The Lancet and Cancer Cell demonstrate that the propensity to metastasize may actually be encoded in the gene expression patterns of primary tumors. Furthermore, the Lancet study by Huang et al. identified separate gene sets that seem to predict lymph node metastasis and overall recurrence in breast cancer patients. These interrelated events would thus appear to be the result of distinct biological processes that can be detected by analysis of the primary tumor. It is our hypothesis that gene expression patterns in the primary tumor determine metastatic potential and probability of survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.  Subsequently, we believe that microarray analysis of esophageal tumors will allow us to identify sets of genes that correlate with both metastasis and survival. Given the correlation between lymph node status and survival in esophageal cancer, we also hypothesize that gene expression analysis and occult disease detection approaches will identify overlapping sets of patients at high risk for recurrence. In this proposal, we intend to explore the relationship between data obtained from microarray analysis of the primary tumors and analysis of occult lymph node involvement. We believe that the combination of this comprehensive molecular staging will allow us to significantly improve upon the current staging of esophageal adenocarcinoma. In addition, we believe that this research will answer some very interesting questions about tumor biology and metastasis in esophageal cancer."
9173,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Mechanical stimuli play a major role in the regulation of muscle mass, and the maintenance of muscle mass contributes significantly to disease prevention and the quality of life. Although a link between mechanical stimuli and the regulation of muscle mass has been recognized for decades, the mechanisms involved in converting mechanical information into the molecular events that control this process have not been defined. Nevertheless, significant advancements are being made in this field, and it has recently been established that signaling through a rapamycin-sensitive (RS) pathway is necessary for mechanically-induced growth of skeletal muscle. Since rapamycin is an inhibitor of a protein kinase called the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), many investigators have concluded that mTOR signaling is necessary for mechanically-induced growth. There is, however, a lack of direct evidence that mTOR is the rapamycin-sensitive (RS) element in this pathway, and the mechanisms involved in the mechanical activation of the RS signaling pathway are not known. Therefore, the focus of this application is aimed at defining how mechanical stimuli activate the RS signaling pathway and skeletal muscle growth. The findings of our preliminary studies implicate a role for phospholipase D (PLD) mediated phosphatidic acid (PA) production and led to the following hypothesis: Mechanical stimuli induce a PLD-dependent increase in PA, which subsequently binds and activates mTOR signaling and skeletal muscle growth. To test this hypothesis, a combination of in vivo and ex vivo models in conjunction with a series of pharmacological and molecular interventions will be employed under two specific aims. The goal of the first specific aim is to determine whether PLD-mediated PA production is sufficient for the induction of RS signaling and skeletal muscle growth, and whether PLD-mediated PA production is necessary for mechanically-induced RS signaling and growth. The goal of the second aim is to determine whether mTOR is the RS element that confers mechanically-induced RS signaling and skeletal muscle growth, and also determine whether mTOR kinase activity and binding to PA are necessary for these events. Taken together, these studies will fill an important gap in the mechanistic understanding of RS signaling by mechanical stimulation and elucidate the role of mTOR and the potentially novel functions of PLD and PA in this pathway. These studies have broad application to health-related research and could lead to the development of therapies aimed at preventing skeletal muscle atrophy during conditions such as bed rest, immobilization, spaceflight, aging, cachexia and dystrophy."
9178,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Indiana University School of Medicine Initiative for Maximizing Graduate Student Diversity (IUSOM IMGSD) program addresses the critical shortage of underrepresented ethnic minorities (UEM) in tenure-track faculty positions at medical schools in the United States. The long-term goals of the IUSOM IMGSD are to: (1) increase the number of UEMs who matriculate in and graduate from Ph.D. programs in the basic medical sciences (BMS) and (2) increase the number of UEMs, in general, who pursue careers as independent biomedical research scientists and faculty members. IUSOM IMGSD will accomplish these goals by (1) recruiting four new UEM graduate students into the basic science departments each year and supporting a total of 8 annually (each student will receive two years of IMGSD stipend support); (2) providing sustained multi-tiered mentoring through all years of doctoral studies, but particularly the initial two years of doctoral studies; (3) providing enhanced curriculum and development sessions during the first two years of doctoral study, including personal one-on-one tutoring when needed; (4) providing faculty mentoring for grant-writing with the goal of obtaining extramural funding for the remaining four years of doctoral education. These goals will result in four specific outcomes: (1) annually, four UEMs will be funded and ready to perform state-of-the-art research under the direction of a nationally known research mentor; (2) UEMs will be publishing in peer-reviewed journals; (3) at graduation with a Ph.D., UEMs will be placed in postdoctoral research positions which will (4) lead them to careers as independent biomedical research scientists or faculty members at a University in the U.S. where they will do biomedical research.    The success of IUSOM IMGSD achieving its goals is based upon the theory that minority students with sufficient financial support, rigorous curricula, strong research experiences and multi-tiered mentors will complete their Ph.D. degrees and pursue careers as independent academic biomedical research scientists/faculty members."
9219,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), via its receptor NOP, modulates nociception, stress, and anxiety. N/OFQ is regarded as an anti-opiate peptide because central N/OFQ causes pronociception and reversal of stress- induced analgesia (SIA). However, N/OFQ can affect nonopioid-mediated analgesia, and its anxiolytic effect is unlikely to be mediated through interaction with the opiate system. Both N/OFQ and NOP are abundant in the hypothalamus, where hypocretins/orexins (Hcrts) are selectively synthesized. The Hcrts regulate wakefulness and alertness, modulate nociceptive processing, and contribute to SIA. Because N/OFQ and Hcrts produce opposite modulations for most behaviors and cellular actions assessed, we hypothesize that N/OFQ exerts its effects on neurobehavior, primarily SIA and fear or stress-induced anxiety-like behavior, through direct modulation of Hcrt neuronal activity in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and/or interaction at the projected sites that receive both N/OFQ and Hcrt inputs and co-express their cognate receptors. Our preliminary studies show that N/OFQ-containing fibers contact Hcrt neurons and that N/OFQ inhibits Hcrt neuronal activity via both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. N/OFQ also depresses cytoplasmic Ca2+ in a majority of the Hcrt neurons in orexin/cameleon 2.1 mouse hypothalamic slices. We found that orexin/ataxin-3 neurodegenerative (orexin/ataxin-3) mice exhibit no SIA in the restraint model. Conversely, intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of Hcrt mimicked SIA in orexin/ataxin-3 mice animals but prevented SIA in wildtype (WT) mice. Furthermore, exogenous Hcrt restored SIA in animals treated with centrally administered N/OFQ. These preliminary results support our hypothesis and lead us to propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Test the hypothesis that N/OFQ-containing fibers contact Hcrt neurons and determine the anatomical source(s) of N/OFQ innervation by using standard anatomical techniques (e.g., immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and retrograde tracing). We will use using multiple labeling quantitative electron microscopical (EM) techniques to further determine whether N/OFQ-containing fibers synaptically contact Hcrt neurons. 2. Characterize the cellular physiological modulation of N/OFQ on Hcrt neurons by using patch clamp recordings of Hcrt neurons from orexin/EGFP mice and by Ca2+ imaging using orexin/cameleon 2.1 mice. 3. Test the hypothesis that N/OFQ blocks SIA partly through the modulation of the Hcrt system by investigating N/OFQ effects on nociceptive processing in WT and orexin/ataxin-3 mice. 4. Test the hypothesis that N/OFQ exerts anxiolytic-like effects partly via inhibition of the Hcrt-mediated stress and anxiety responses in mice using both conditioned and unconditioned fear paradigms. The proposed research will reveal whether there is an integrated neuronal circuit linking the N/OFQ and Hcrt systems that provides a dual-modulation to balance stress responses particularly related to nociceptive processing and stress adaptation."
9243,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alphaherpesviruses are major human and animal pathogens that cause a wide spectrum of disease in the infected host. Us3 is a serine/threonine kinase, encoded by all alphaherpesviruses, which functions in the prevention of virus-induced apoptosis as well as de-envelopment of primary enveloped virions from the perinuclear space during virion maturation. In addition, Us3 plays an important role in the cell-to-cell spread of virus infection, which has been a focus of our studies. Cell-to-cell spread of infection is a critically important mechanism for virus dissemination in the host for many viruses and this is particularly true for the herpesviruses. Reactivation of herpesviruses occurs in the presence of a fully primed immune system. Cell-to-cell spread of virus infection occurs quickly and can continue in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton through Us3 kinase activity is required for Us3 enhancement of cell-to-cell spread. The identification of cellular substrates for Us3 that facilitate virus spread would represent a major advance in our understanding of this process and has the potential to identify cellular targets for antiviral interventions. Using a yeast two-hybrid substrate trap we identified the cellular protein, Eps8 (epidermal growth factor receptor protein substrate 8), as a potential Us3 substrate. Eps8 is a signaling molecule required for actin remodeling in response to growth factor stimulation. Our preliminary data indicate that Us3 and Eps8 interact in animal cells, that Eps8 is required for Us3-mediated actin remodeling and that both Eps8 and Us3 are required for efficient spread of infection between cells. In this application, we propose to define the molecular basis for the interaction between Us3 and Eps8, determine how this interaction promotes cell-to-cell spread of virus infection and examine the consequences of this interaction in vivo. Aim 1: define the molecular basis for the interaction between Us3 and Eps8. Aim 2: define the mechanism by which Us3 directs Eps8 activities. Aim 3: determine the significance of the Us3/Eps8 interaction to virus pathogenesis."
9276,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the third most costly disease in the United States after cardiac disease and cancer, has shown an increase in incidence recently, moving from 7th to 5th as a leading cause of death among the elderly. Currently available medical strategies treat the symptoms rather than address the underlying processes responsible for the progressive decline in cognitive function seen in AD patients. However, results from both clinical and basic science research suggest that antidiabetic agents (e.g., thiazolidinediones - TZDs) may be beneficial in the treatment of AD, and a few human and animal studies have shown that use of rosiglitazone (a TZD) can improve memory and lead to cognitive improvements. These results appear to provide compelling preliminary evidence to support the use of antidiabetic drugs to combat the cognitive impairment associated with AD. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms, or about the identity of the CNS targets of TZDs. Some of the proposed beneficial effects of TZDs include reestablishment of insulin sensitivity and associated peripheral and/or CNS glucose utilization, along with reductions in inflammatory cytokines, Ab1-42 deposits, microglial activation, and intracellular Ca2+ levels. Given that Ca2+ dysregulation is considered a hallmark of brain aging and AD, and is also present in animal models of diabetes, we propose that some Ca2+ biomarkers of brain aging may be targets for intervention with TZDs. Using electrophysiological, molecular and Ca2+ imaging techniques along with a team of qualified scientists, this project will test the overall hypothesis that some TZDs can improve cognitive status in aged animals, by reducing key biomarkers of brain aging and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. We will determine the molecular bases underlying the potential use of TZDs for the treatment of AD by the following Specific Aims: 1) to test the hypothesis that TZDs act as neuroprotective agents by normalizing Ca2+ levels within neurons and/or glial cells; and 2) to test the prediction that in vivo TZD treatment can improve cognition in aged animals and restore Ca2+ homeostasis. Results form our studies may provide support for the therapeutic application of TZDs in preventing/retarding the cognitive decline seen in AD. Furthermore, these studies will contribute to future drug discovery efforts to generate new TZD-derived or similar drugs for the treatment of AD."
9301,HHS,HHS,"The ubiquitin system is a major regulatory mechanism of cellular processes in which speed,specificity, and timing are critical. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of key substrates controls cellcycle progression, signal transduction pathways, differentiation,apoptosis, DNA repair and theimmune response. This process is mediated by a multimericmachine, composed of a regulatoryubiquitin-targeting component and an effector protein degradation engine. Theregulatorycomponent, which targets ubiquitin to proteins destined for degradation, is itself composed ofseveral multimeric elements (e.g., the SCFubiquitin ligase complexes) that contribute much of thespecificity inherent in the process. In humans, there are sixty-eight SCFligases, each characterizedby a different F-boxprotein subunit that provides specificity by directly recruiting the substrate tothe rest of the ligase and,ultimately, to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Notably, only three outof 68 human SCFubiquitin ligases (containing the F-box proteins UTrcp, Fbw7 and Skp2,respectively) have well-established substrates, many of which are involved in cell cycle control.The remaining 65F-box proteins are considered as  orphan  since their substrates still awaitdiscovery. We have recently developed a novel immunopurification strategy that enriches for substrates ofF-box proteins followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We will systematicallyidentifybiologically significantsubstrates of human orphan F-boxproteins (Specific Aim 1). Because of ourresearch interest, we will focus particularly on those orphan F-boxproteins that our preliminaryresults suggest to be involved in cell cycle control and cancer. Under Aim 2,we will validate thebiologically most significantsubstrates identifiedunder Aim 1. Given their critical role in regulating cell proliferation, SCFligases are often the target of cancer-related deregulation and involved in oncogenic transformation. Therefore,the information gainedfrom the proposed studies will be of direct relevance to cancer biology and other proliferativediseases."
9328,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxoplasma gondii infections are a public health hazard for millions of individuals that contact this pathogen annually, particularly those with immune systems weakened by aging, chemotherapy or AIDS; and women that acquire the infection during pregnancy. Exposure to this pathogen occurs through contact with environmental sources and contaminated food ranking T. gondii only behind bacterial pathogens, Listeria and Salmonella, as the third-leading cause of food-borne death. No current therapy is able to prevent life- time infections caused by the encysted bradyzoite stage and drug toxicity limits long-term treatment for at risk individuals. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new approaches capable of preventing chronic Toxoplasma infection, although achieving this goal is hampered by a lack of understanding of the molecular basis for tissue cyst formation. Recently, we have completed a comprehensive SAGE analysis (funded by R21 award AI53815) of the transcriptome of the Toxoplasma intermediate life cycle. These studies demonstrate primary developmental transitions leading to tissue cyst formation are accompanied by a temporally ordered set of transcriptional events from genes that are dispersed across all parasite chromosomes, and are therefore, co-regulated by trans-acting protein factors. This exploratory grant seeks to gain a greater understanding of the core transcriptional mechanisms associated with parasite development by characterizing the nucleotide sequence elements and identifying the protein factors involved in the expression of known and novel bradyzoite-specific genes. We have developed dual- luciferase assays based on high-throughput cloning methods to functionally demonstrate that the control of tachyzoite- and bradyzoite-specific gene expression requires gene proximal sequences lying upstream of coding regions in the Toxoplasma genome. In this proposal, we will employ these same methods to define the minimal sequence requirements for five bradyzoite promoters, and in turn, use this information to identify the appropriate DNA binding proteins through biochemical and genetic strategies. The studies proposed here will address a fundamental gap in our understanding how Toxoplasma parasites (and other Apicomplexa) regulate gene expression, and will ultimately, lead to a better understanding of how these parasites control development into the clinically important tissue cyst."
9366,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of our laboratory has been the recognition of a cardiac progenitor cell (PC) that forms substantial quantities of cardiomyocytes after infarction. Although this work has been successful, to prevent ischemic myocardial damage acutely and the development of an ischemic myopathy chronically, we need to identify a PC capable of restoring the integrity of injured coronary vessels and/or creating de novo conductive coronary arteries and their distal branches. Theoretically, in a manner comparable to hematopoietic stem cells that can repopulate and completely reconstitute the ablated bone marrow, PCs may possess the inherent ability to rebuild the damaged myocardium and convert a severely diseased heart into a physiologically functional heart. Based on this premise, this renewal application will test whether resident PCs conform to a non-uniform cell pool which sustains myocardial homeostasis through the activation and commitment of distinct cell classes devoted respectively to the replacement of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in coronary vessels and cardiomyocytes. The hypothesis to be tested is that vascular niches are present within the wall of the coronary circulation and vascular progenitor cells (VPCs) are stored within vascular niches. VPCs are viewed as a subset of the PC pool which possesses specialized functions predominantly devoted to the turnover of SMCs and ECs and vasculogenesis. For this purpose, we need profound understanding of the biology of cardiac PCs and must determine whether this PC pool includes subsets which have powerful vasculogenic properties. Identification of a coronary VPC able to differentiate predominantly into SMCs and ECs would suggest that the heart possesses the inherent ability to create the various portions of the coronary circulation. However, a critical issue concerns the origin of VPCs and the mechanisms involved in the preservation of the VPC compartment in the coronary circulation. This may be accomplished by migration of primitive cells from the bone marrow to the vessel wall, asymmetric and symmetric division of resident VPCs within the vascular niches or both. Therefore, the long-term objective of this proposal is the acquisition of fundamental knowledge on the function of VPCs and to determine whether niche homeostasis is regulated by extrinsic and/or intrinsic cellular processes. The identity of VPCs and the mechanisms involved in the activation and differentiation of this PC class into SMCs and ECs will be evaluated by a combination of cellular and molecular approaches together with in vivo experimentation to document its efficacy in the restoration of the integrity of the coronary vasculature and its regeneration. Ultimately, VPC may be employed to replace damaged large coronary arteries with newly formed vessels and to correct rarefaction of resistance coronary arterioles and capillary structures by expansion of the cardiac microcirculation. If this were possible, cell therapy may be employed to interfere with ischemic injury, the prevailing cause of human heart failure and prevention may supersede the need for myocardial regeneration."
9384,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal rods and cones utilize visual pigments that are coupled to G-protein signaling cascades to detect the presence of photons. Little is known about how these two cell types use such a remarkably similar phototransduction cascade to achieve their distinct functional properties. A major objective of this project is to address this fundamental question. An understanding of the mechanisms that regulate phototransduction also has important disease relevance because deregulated signaling that occurs at different transduction steps often has a negative impact on photoreceptor cell survival. Our second objective is to apply what we learned in phototransduction and translate that knowledge into a better understanding of disease mechanisms in rods and cones so that a rational therapeutic strategy can be devised. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis that differences in the functional properties between rods and cones can be explained, in part, by the transduction efficiency between the visual pigment and transducin, the visual G-protein. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results that show a 100-fold decrease in sensitivity when cone transducin was placed downstream of rhodopsin. Experiments in Aim 1 will systematically analyze the contribution of the rod and cone isoforms of the heterotrimeric transducin subunits toward the observed decrease in transduction efficiency at this step. The potential function of the G¿? subunit in controlling photoreceptor noise and response recovery will also be investigated. In the second aim, we will investigate the cell death pathways that are triggered by light exposure or genetic mutations that lead to  equivalent light . Experiments in Aim 2 are designed (a) to probe the underlying mechanism for the toxicity of the rhodopsin/arrestin complex; (b) to investigate whether endocytosis of the rhodopsin/arrestin complex is required to generate the cell death signal; (c) to analyze whether constitutive phototransduction in cones is a potential mechanism for cell death; and (d) to study the involvement of ATF-3 and ATF-4 transcriptional regulators in the cellular response to light damage. The outcome from these experiments will address the fundamental question as to how cells may utilize G-protein signaling cascades, which consist of highly similar protein members, to achieve diverse signaling properties. In addition, we will gain a better understanding of the relationship between defective signaling and disease."
9432,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of this project is to characterize the mechanisms that regulate apoptosis (programmed cell death, or PCD) and restrict it to the appropriate cells in C. elegans.  Apoptosis in C. elegans is triggered by CED-3 (a caspase), which requires CED-4 (an Apaf-1 family member) for its activation.  Two C. elegans genes, icd-1 and -2, identified in this laboratory, result in widespread CED-4-dependent, CED-3-independent apoptosis.  A comprehensive set of experiments in C. elegans and human cells will be performed to illuminate the action of ICD-1 and -2 in repression of this CED-4-mediated apoptosis.  In the first aim, the specificity of the CED-4-dependent PCD and sterility will be investigated in chromosomal mutants lacking icd gene activity and the hypothesis that icd-1 and icd-2 are functionally separable will be tested.  The potential conservation of their function will be examined by analyzing whether they can inhibit apoptosis in human cells and whether the human proteins can rescue the C. elegans mutants.  In the second aim, a model accounting for the action of ICD-1 and -2 in the core apoptotic pathway will be critically evaluated by analyzing their fate, mechanism of action, and interactions in the PCD pathway.  The hypotheses that ICD-1 is a substrate of caspases, that ICD proteins can inhibit caspase activity, and that a conserved caspase cleavage site and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) participate in the PCD-repressing function of ICD-1 in dying cells will be tested.  Further, the role of other caspases in the CED-3-independent, CED-4-dependent PCD seen in icd(-) mutants and the interactions between ICD-1, ICD-2, and PCD pathway components will be examined.  Finally, new apoptotic regulators (some which inhibit apoptosis in mammals) identified by RNAi-based screens will be analyzed.  These genes were identified based on CED-3-independent apoptosis or CED-4-dependent sterility when their activity is diminished.  The genes will be categorized into phenotypic and functional groups and the action of selected genes in the PCD pathway investigated.  These studies should help to advance our understanding of both apoptotic regulation and the underlying causes of many diseases that result from dysregulated apoptosis by characterizing candidate factors that may be dysfunctional in human neurodegenerative diseases or that are inappropriately activated in cancers."
9440,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current 'epidemic' of obesity in the United States has been ascribed to environmental changes that have occurred over the past two decades. Prominent in this is the ready economic availability of highly palatable, high caloric density foods. Although numerous studies have focused on hormones such as insulin and leptin, and neurotransmitters, which act at the medial hypothalamus to regulate calorie intake, little attention has focused on the potential regulation of central nervous system (CNS) circuitry which mediates the rewarding or motivating aspects of food. This circuitry includes the midbrain dopamine neurons (DA) as well as other forebrain areas with which the medial hypothalamus has extensive direct and indirect connections. Our lab has evidence that the candidate adiposity signals insulin and leptin decrease performance in behavioral tasks that assess food reward and that require DA signaling. We hypothesize that the midbrain DA neurons whose cell bodies are in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) serve as a direct target for insulin and leptin. In this proposal we will test this hypothesis in rats by studying the effects of insulin or leptin infused directly into the VTA on behavioral procedures that evaluate different aspects of food reward/motivation: a free-feeding ingestive task, the conditioned place preference, and self-administration. We will compare sweet vs. fat food reward in these tasks, to evaluate macronutrient specificity. We will infuse insulin receptor antisense oligonucleotides directly into the VTA to determine the role of endogenous insulin signaling in modulation of food reward behavior. Because VTA DA neurons express insulin and leptin receptors, we will measure insulin- and leptin-stimulation of the PI3 kinase pathway as an index of direct VTA activation at the cellular level. Comparable studies will be carried out in rats fed a defined high fat diet snack in addition to chow, a model of CNS insulin resistance that we have recently developed. We will use this model to test whether the behavioral and cellular actions of insulin and/or leptin at the VTA are blunted by high fat diet ingestion, i.e., a model of VTA insulin or leptin resistance. Together these studies will evaluate the potential regulation of reward circuitry and function in the CNS by adiposity signals. Findings from these studies will contribute to the long-term goal of learning whether altered food reward value contributes to the (relative) overeating which occurs in association with the availability of highly palatable foods, independent of caloric need."
9463,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   At the mid-point of my academic career, I have been productive in patient-oriented research, as documented by publications in a number of prominent journals, evidence of national and international recognition, and a good funding record from the NIH and other funding sources. My Epidemiology Research Laboratory does clinical epidemiology research in the health outcomes of human retroviruses human T-lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I and -II), and my NIH R01-funded multicenter HTLV cohort study forms the centerpiece of the Research Plan in this application. I also study the epidemiology of transfusion-transmitted viruses and of blood donor demographics and donation behavior. My current research environment includes both the UCSF Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Epidemiology & Biostatistics, my academic home, and Blood Centers of the Pacific (BCP), a community blood bank 1 mile from the UCSF campus where my Epidemiology Lab and close collaborators are located. Letters from the heads of these institutions support my K24 application, and document the strong affiliations in research and training between UCSF and BCP. I have already mentored a number of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, as well as several professionals seeking additional training in clinical epidemiology research. I am applying for a K24 grant at this point because I would like to reduce my effort on clinical duties and specific funded projects in order to pursue new interests in patient-oriented research and to expand my mentoring activities. The new trainees would carry out supervised epidemiology research projects in HTLV clinical outcomes, in transfusion transmitted viral infections, or a new area in the epidemiology of blood donor demographics and donation behavior. They will participate in the Training in Clinical Research courses given by the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Finally, I shall expand an existing training program in International Transfusion Safety organized by BCP under an NIH Fogarty International Center grant. This program brings blood bankers from less developed countries for an intensive summer training program in research methods related to blood safety."
9465,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Evidence suggests that aging is accompanied by significant changes in the immune apparatus that contribute to the initiation and progression of geriatric diseases. However, the fundamental mechanism underlying immune dysfunction in senescence remains to be fully defined. The objective of this study is to understand the basis of immune dysfunction by focusing on the role of regulatory ubiquitination in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes during aging. The long-term goal of this study is to fully define the molecular basis of immune dysregulation that accompanies aging. Our working hypothesis is that alterations in the regulation of ubiquitination and/or deubiquitination of important signaling intermediaries contribute to T cell dysfunction in the elderly by modulating activation-induced signaling. Our preliminary results demonstrate that (1) there is significant accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in T cells from the elderly, (2) the induction and activity of transcription factor NFkB, a paradigm for regulatory ubiquitination, is significantly compromised in activated T cells from the elderly, (3) proteasomal-degradation of ubiquitinated proteins is compromised in T cells from the elderly as compared to those from young donors and finally, (4) both ubiquitin conjugating and deubiquitinating activity are significantly altered in T cells from the elderly. With ubiquitination and ubiquitin-like protein modifications taking center stage in processes ranging from induction of trancription factor, to regulation of gene expression, it is likely that aberrant ubiquitination or regulation of ubiquitination may contribute to immune dysfunction in the elderly. Therefore, to understand the basis for this age-related alteration in regulatory ubiquitination, using signaling leading to the induction of NFkappa B as a paradigm, we will specifically : (i) identify and characterize the effect of age on ubiquitination of substrates in T cell subsets, (ii) delineate the underlying mechanism/s for altered ubiquitination in T cell subsets from the elderly and (iii) determine the regulatory role of the proteasome in altered ubiquitination and its functional impact on T cell responses. Results from these studies will provide valuable insights into regulatory ubiquitination in immune function underlying immune senescence in humans and may provide a molecular framework for designing potential therapeutic intervention in not only boosting vaccine efficiency in the elderly but also provide an insight into the role of ubiquitination in geriatric diseases."
9470,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) is found on the surface of many of the potentially invasive pathogens that colonize the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract, including members of the genera Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. However, for each of these species the display of ChoP is phase-variable, suggesting that in some circumstances its expression maybe disadvantageous. During the prior period, we showed that ChoP expressing variants predominate during natural human carriage and are more persistent in animal models of colonization. We propose to examine ChoP-mediated effects that promote bacterial passage through the epithelial barrier as a mechanism that facilitates persistence through evasion of normal mucosal clearance functions and contributes to disease by invasion into tissues. Bacterial expression of ChoP allows for mimicry of host phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine and platelet activating factor (PAF). For S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, choline is obtained exclusively from host sources. Since choline is also a nutritional requirement for host cells, choline depletion by bacteria may be an unrecognized source of cytotoxicity. Aim 1 will examine the effect of bacterial competition for choline with host cells and its contribution to cellular damage and bacterial penetration of epithelial barriers. Mimicry of PAF also allows for attachment to epithelial cells through binding to its receptor, rPAF. PAF has been shown to induce damage to the mucosa. Aim 2 will examine whether bacterial interaction with rPAF leads to PAF agonist activity that compromises the epithelial barrier. We have shown that ChoP is the target of both innate (C-reactive protein) and adaptive (human ChoP-specific lgG2) immune responses. The effectiveness of antibody to ChoP suggests that ChoP could serve as a common target antigen for protection against pathogens originating in the respiratory tract. Aim 3 will determine the effects of the immune response to ChoP on colonization, where our findings demonstrate that expression of ChoP is most important to pathogenesis."
9508,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to identify the nucleotide changes that have led to phenotypic differences between closely related Drosophila species. The larger goal is to determine whether these evolved changes reflect a special set of all possible mutations. There are three specific aims for this proposal. First, we will survey three previously identified enhancer regions of the shavenbaby/ovo gene for all transcription factor binding sites that can be detected in vitro. This analysis will leverage the fact that all three enhancers have evolved new functions in D. sechellia, presumably through the loss or gain of transcription factor binding sites. This survey will provide the foundation for detailed study of binding sites that have evolved new functions. In particular, we will test whether these sites are required for gene function in D. melanogaster and we will further test whether altering them to a D. sechellia sequence is sufficient to alter their function in the manner in which svb function has evolved. We will then perform a population genetic analysis of the conserved and evolved transcription factor binding sites to test whether the evolving sites have evolved by natural selection. Second, we will continue development of a novel method for ultra high-resolution mapping of evolved differences between D. simulans, D. sechellia and D. mauritiana. This new method extends traditional meiotic mapping approaches by employing genetic markers that flank an evolved region to allow automated identification of individuals with informative recombination events. This approach promises to provide a transformative technology for studying the evolution of a large and diverse set of phenotypic differences, especially so-called quantitative traits that are controlled by multiple genes. Relevance: Differences between the response of individuals to disease and drug treatment are caused in part by genetic variation. In addition, the traits that make us uniquely human evolved in large part through changes in gene regulation, rather than through the evolution of new genes. This project involves detailed study of the evolution of a new pattern of gene regulation in a species of Drosophila. This detailed analysis of gene regulation promises to provide new insights into how gene regulation functions and evolves in natural species to cause possibly adaptive changes in morphology."
9534,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal outlines a career development plan for the applicant, an academic neonatologist with a longstanding commitment to understanding the pathogenesis of neonatal pulmonary vascular remodeling and whose goal is to become an independent investigator. Under the mentorship of established investigators and a multidisciplinary advisory committee, the candidate will pursue a program of education (coursework, conferences, seminars) and a research project addressing the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neonatal hypoxia-mediated pulmonary vascular remodeling (HPVR), which predisposes to the important clinical problem of neonatal pulmonary hypertension. HPVR is characterized by thickening of small pulmonary arteries due to cellular proliferation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. ECM protein deposition and turnover are regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The candidate has developed innovative neonatal mouse (in vivo) and cell culture (in vitro) models to evaluate neonatal HPVR. The candidate has made the novel observations that MMP-2 is the principal MMP both in vitro and in vivo and that hypoxia increases MMP-2 while concomitantly decreasing its inhibitor [tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2]. In addition, the candidate has shown that specific ECM proteins including collagens (CN), periostin (PN), fibronectin (FN-1), and thrombospondin (TSP-1) are increased, while other ECM proteins either do not change [e.g. osteopontin (OPN)] or decrease [e.g. tenascin-c (TN-C)] in response to hypoxia. The objective of this project is to determine the mechanisms by which hypoxia alters ECM deposition during HPVR, with specific focus on the role of MMP-2 in this process. The Specific Aims are: (1) To test the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial medial thickening, cellular proliferation, and ECM molecule deposition are decreased in neonatal C57BL/6 mice treated with MMP inhibitors (MMP-2 I) and in MMP-2 -/- (MMP-2 null) mice as compared to neonatal wild-type (WT) mice, and (2) To test the hypothesis that hypoxia increases MMP-2 synthesis/activation and downstream ECM molecule expression by increasing endothelin-1 (ET-1) and activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Determination of the mechanisms of ECM protein deposition in the neonatal pulmonary vasculature will provide essential information on normal pulmonary vascular development and lead to the development of new therapies for HPVR."
9600,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a third submission for a Mentored Patient-oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to support the candidate's development into an independent investigator capable of integrating a solid background and training in neurocognition with the tools of molecular genetics for use in family-based studies of bipolar disorder (BPD). Persistent neurocognitive deficits in BPD during periods of euthymia have aroused interest in neurocognitive dysfunction as an intermediate phenotype, or endophenotype, for studies of its disease susceptibility loci; however, a critical gap in our knowledge exists regarding its familiality or heritability. The endophenotypic criterion of aggregation within families has not yet been convincingly demonstrated among unaffected first-degree relatives of BPD patients. The candidate proposes to first gain the knowledge and training required to collect and analyze data to provide critical validation and refinement of neurocognition as an endophenotype for BPD and to subsequently conduct preliminary research toward this goal. The development plan has three major goals: 1) To expand and refine the candidate's knowledge of the neurocognition of BPD with regard to its use in molecular genetic studies 2) To gain experience in family study methodology including a significant emphasis on understanding molecular genetic models and statistical approaches to integrate quantitative clinical data and molecular genetic data, and 3) To acquire direct research experience and preliminary data on the genetic underpinnings of neurocognitive dysfunction in BPD. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive didactic program has been prepared. In addition, the candidate will conduct a family-based study of neurocognition in patients with BPD and their unaffected siblings. The research plan proposes to collect comprehensive neurocognitive data in 100 unaffected siblings of BPD patients, 100 stable BPD patients, and 100 demographically-matched healthy volunteers. The feasibility of large-scale implementation of such a viable assay would represent a vital step toward elucidating the genetic underpinnings of BPD. The career development activities and completion of the research study described in this application are expected to provide the candidate with the knowledge and experience to develop into an independent investigator with the expertise to conduct high quality family- based studies that incorporate neurocognition into molecular genetic studies of bipolar disorder."
9602,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent analysis of data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse indicates that the estimated number of people age 50 or older in need of substance abuse treatment is expected to increase from 1.7 million in 2000/2001 to 4.4 million in 2020. Depressive disorders among opiate abusers have detrimental effects on their well-being and ability to refrain from illegal drug use. This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development (K-08) Award seeks to promote the Candidate's long-term goal to become an independent clinical investigator researching effective psychosocial treatments for late-life depression among older adults with drug dependence problems. The training and research activities described in this application will take place in the cross-disciplinary environment of the School of Social Work, the Advanced Center for Interventions and Services Research for Late-life Mood Disorders (Reynolds, PI), and the Drug Abuse Vulnerability: Mechanisms and Manifestations Center (Cornelius, Director of the Clinical Core) at the University of Pittsburgh. Training will enable the Candidate to become proficient in the adaptation, testing, and delivery of an intervention for older adults with co-occurring substance abuse and depression disorders and to develop the knowledge necessary to integrate an effective treatment model into the standard of care offered by substance abuse treatment facilities. The Candidate's pilot work with older methadone clients identified Problem Solving Therapy (PST) as the most appropriate therapeutic intervention for this population. PST is an empirically tested treatment approach for older adults for the treatment of depression. The research plan will be implemented at a methadone clinic that serves a diverse clientele-a third are over the age of 50, nearly half (44%) of whom are African-American. Phase 1 of this research plan will be a PST certification study to obtain the necessary qualifications in PST for all counselors involved in the project. Phase 2 of the research plan will include a randomized clinical trial comparing 60 participants receiving the PST intervention to 60 participants receiving treatment as usual (TAU). On the basis of the data, Phase 3 will be devoted to data analysis, manuscript development, and the writing and submission of an R-01. Understanding the relationship between substance abuse and psychiatric disorders is critical to providing appropriate services to a growing and aging addicted population in the United States."
9606,HHS,HHS,"The study of retroviruses have resulted in important discoveries and has lead to insights into basic cellbiology including mechanisms of cell signaling, transcriptional and post transcriptional control of geneexpression, and ultimately cellular transformation and cancer. Project 2 focuses on the human T-cellleukemia virus (HTLV) which is associated primarily with leukemia and highly valuable model of retrovirusinduced cancer. The long-term objective of this highly interactive project is to understand virus-hostinteractions that regulate viral replication post-transcriptionally. We have shown that the post-transcriptionalpositive HTLV regulatory protein, Rex, the focus of the previous application, does not directly contribute tocellular transformation in vitro. We extended our work through collaboration to identify and characterize anovel function of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 related accessory gene products that act post-transcriptionally asnegative regulators of both Tax and Rex. Our exciting new function assigned to p28 and p30 as posttranscriptionalcontrol regulators provide the basis for the current proposal. We hypothesize that p28-mediated reduction of viral replication in T-lymphocytes and/or the proliferation of T-lymphocytes may permitsurvival of these cells by allowing escape from immune recognition, which would be consistent with thecritical role of HTLV accessory proteins in viral persistence in vivo. We seek to define the post-transcriptionalmechanisms of p28 repressive activity by 1) identifying and characterizing functional domains andbiochemical properties of p28, 2) determining the primary sequence and structure/function of the p28 mRNAtarget, and 3) determining the contribution of p28 in viral replication, lymphocyte activation/transformation,and persistence of the virus and in vivo. Understanding the exact mechanism of action of post-transcriptionalcontrol of p28/p30 ultimately will provide a means for therapeutic targeting of these proteins to eradicateHTLV persistence in the host. Important to this PPG, our findings will contribute to understand how HTLValters T-cell physiology and thus gain insight into the mechanisms of regulating viral replication and the earlyphases of lymphocyte activation and cellular transformation."
9613,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the period of the past award, we have developed a transgenic mouse that targets Cre-recombinase to the epicardium. This is a unique model system that we have used to demonstrate that conditional mutation of the retinoid receptor alpha (RXR1) in the epicardium affects cardiac morphogenesis and impairs embryonic survival. This mutation also uncovered a novel role of nuclear receptors in coronary arteriogenesis. We have subsequently determined that the 2-catenin gene acts downstream of the RXR1 pathway and we have generated data demonstrating that mutation of 2-catenin in the epicardium impairs cardiac morphogenesis by reducing cardiac cell proliferation and coronary vessel formation. Here we hypothesize that a Wnt/2 catenin pathway in the epicardium regulates key steps in cardiac development, including cell proliferation in the myocardium and the formation of the coronary vasculature. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we propose three independent genetic approaches that address the following specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the role of epicardial 2-catenin in cell fate specification and maturation of epicardial derivatives ex vivo and in vivo using time-lapse analysis of explanted tissues, lineage tracing, and mechanistic studies in epicardial-2-catenin mutant mice. In Aim 2 we will determine whether Wnt activity regulates the formation of the coronary arteries and the expansion of the compact zone. To address this question, we will use a genetic strategy to block 2-catenin nuclear translocation and analyze signaling downstream of Wnt in the epicardium.. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine whether 2 catenin is a functional mediator of RXR1 signaling. As a proof of principle for this hypothesis, we propose the rescue of the RXR1 phenotype by interbreeding the RXR1 mutant mice with the conditional 2 catenin/loxP (ex3) mouse, resulting in mice with constitutively active 2 catenin in the epicardium. Completion of this proposal will unravel the mechanisms of retinoid/2 catenin signaling in coronary formation and ventricular compaction and might offer the potential for therapeutic interventions to ameliorate or even treat coronary disorders that are leading causes of mortality."
9620,HHS,NSF,"Therapy for brain tumors is complicated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which impedes delivery ofchemotherapeutic agents to the central nervous system (CNS). Osmotic BBB disruption (BBBD) is a method todeliver agents across the BBB to infiltrating tumor cells. The Brain Tumor Program Review Group (PRG) recentlyidentified the areas of drug delivery,targeted chemotherapy, imaging, and the BBB as priorities forresearch in CNSmetastases. During the previous funding period, we addressed the PRG points by showing that route of delivery ofa tumor-specific immunoconjugate(BR96-DOX) is directly related to survival in an implanted metastasis model,and combination protocols with radiotherapy further improved survival. The current question is how to furtherextend this paradigm in the laboratory and the clinic by focusing on the BBB, ~to examine issues in delivery ofantitumor agents to brain tumors and to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic approaches. In Aim 1,we plan to expandour current implanted CNS metastatic tumor model in nude rats to a hematogenous CNS metastatic model. Wepropose to assess tumor growth by using a novel magnetic resonance (MR) imaging approach using super-paramagnetic iron particles to detect CNS tumors prior to conventionalimaging. Aim 2 will investigatetherapeuticapproaches for CNS metastases. We will determine if protein bindingimpactsCNS chemotherapeutic delivery andefficacy. Additionally, we will assess targeted delivery of the BR96-DOX immunoconjugate used in conjunctionwith standard chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that the thiol N-acetylcysteine (NAC) with or without sodium thiosulfate (STS), may ameliorate the bone marrow toxicity ofcombination chemotherapy/radiation protocols without compromising CNS chemotherapyefficacy. Finally,in Aim4 a clinical phase 1trial of NAC is proposed. We hypothesize that NAC administered i.a. caudallyin the aorta willbe safe in patients and prevent myelosuppresion in combination with high dose chemotherapy given into thevertebral and carotid arteries cephalad. Our overall hypothesis is that CNS enhanced delivery and combinationtherapies in models of CNS metastasis will increase anti-tumor efficacy as assessed by serial MR imaging, tumorvolumetrics, and survival, whileminimizingtoxicity withchemoprotection. Laboratory studies of BBBD-enhancedchemotherapy have been translated intoclinical trials, and excitingefficacy has been demonstrated in primary CNSlymphoma. This revised competitive renewal is the continuation of the original 1978 surgical CREG, and isresponsive to the priorities established in July 2000 by the joint NINDS and NCI Brain Tumor PRG."
9648,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KIRs comprise a family of inhibitory and activating MHC class I-specific receptors. Differential expression of KIR by NK cells and some T cells creates KIR repertoires that can influence cellular response. KIR are thus implicated in innate and adaptive immunity, and, through NK-cell crosstalk with dendritic cells, in the switch between the two. Human KIR exhibit polymorphism that individualizes NK-cell repertoires. Variables include gene number, ratio of activating and inhibitory KIR, and allelic polymorphism. KIRs represent a rapidly changing component of the human immune system, as seen from the variation between ethnic populations. Such characteristics suggest KIR differences influence human immunity, a hypothesis supported by several preliminary reports of KIR associations with infection, autoimmunity and transplantation. KIR are much more complicated than first anticipated. Consequently, immunological investigation has been limited to KIRs present in Caucasian populations, while population and clinical studies have used analytical methods of low resolution. The overall goals of this renewal application are twofold: first, to obtain an accurate and clear picture of the scope of KIR diversity in the human species and of the events leading to the birth and death of KIR; second, to develop better methods for analyzing KIR haplotypes and genotypes, methods that will facilitate high resolution population analysis and future clinical studies. The four Specific Aims will extend ongoing and productive investigation using established methods, at the same time as new methods are being developed and introduced. Aim 1 will give detailed description of KIR in a human population having a reduced KIR diversity, the Japanese. Aim 2 will define new KIR in Africans, African-Americans and Asian- Indians, poorly studied populations for which much undiscovered diversity is indicated. Already identified is a novel KIR3DL gene (KIR3DL1/2v), common in Africans. KIR3DL1/2v-containing haplotypes will be analyzed in Aim 3 to determine if KIR3DL1/2v is parent or child of the familiar KIR3DL1 and KIR3DL2 genes. To do this, a novel approach for the isolation and analysis of KIR haplotypes will be implemented. This approach will also contribute to Aims 1 and 4; in the latter, typing for KIR haplotypes based upon single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be developed. The approach will be piloted in the relatively simple Japanese KIR system and then extended to the more complex and highly mixed population of the US."
9710,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The Diabetes Prevention Program is a multicenter controlled clinical trial examining the efficacy of an intensive life-style intervention or metformin to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in a population selected to be at high risk due to the presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Development of diabetes, defined by 1997 ADA criteria, is the primary outcome whilecardiovascular disease and its risk factors are important secondary outcomes. The DPP began recruitment in mid-1996. At the time of this application, total  study exposure is a mean of approximately 3 years (range 2 to 5) with a total of approximately 10,000 patient years in the 3,234 volunteers in the 3-arm study. On the basis of a statistically significant and clinically compelling decrease in the development of diabetes in the life-style intervention and metformin-treated groups (58% and 31% reductions, respectively) compared withthe placebo treated group, the DPP Data Monitoring Board and NIDDK ended the masked treatment phase of the study in May, 2001, one year earlier than originally planned.This application is designed to take further advantage of the scientifically and clinically valuable cohort of DPP volunteers and the large volume of data collected during the study. The highly compliant DPP cohort, including 45% minorities, is the largest IGT population ever studied. Moreover, the subcohort that has developed diabetes (n approximately 700) has been followed from near the exact time of diabetes onset. Clinically important research questionsremain in the wake of the DPP. The carefully collected, centrally measured and graded data in this cohort should help to answer, definitively, a number of important questions regarding the clinical course of IGT and early onset type 2 diabetes. Specific aims include: 1. Examine the long-term effects and durability of prior DPP intervention on the major DPP outcomes includingdiabetes, clinical cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, CVD risk factors, quality of life and cost-benefit; 2. Determine the clinical course of new onset type 2 diabetes and IGT, in particular regarding microvascular and neurologic complications; 3. Determine the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk factors and atherosclerosis in new onset type 2 diabetes and IGT; and 4. Examine topics 1-3 in minority populations, men vs. women, and in oldersubjects in the DPP. The current application is for 5 years of funding, although the some of the goals of the projects described will require a 10-year study."

Approximately 40% of college students are heavy episodic drinkers, defined as consuming five or more drinks on a single occasion for men (four or more drinks for women) at least once in the past 2 weeks. Heavy episodic drinking is associated with many academic, social, and health-related problems. Self-regulation models, which aim to enable individuals to identify goals and use such skills as stimulus control and reinforcement to trigger desirable behaviors, have been successfully used to prevent harmful drinking. Motivational interviewing (MI) is an approach that is consistent with a self-regulation model of behavior change. The goal of MI is to trigger self-regulation processes, such as encouraging individuals to evaluate their present condition, weighing the costs and benefits of changing or not changing, and committing to change. Despite general enthusiasm for these approaches, few studies have systematically investigated the effectiveness of MI with college students. Five MI studies with college students were identified and collectively have indicated that MI is a viable approach with young adults. However, the preliminary success of these studies needs to be expanded using a larger population and an extended follow-up period, and the separate and combined effects of motivational interviewing and feedback have not been tested. Thus, the present research will use a three-group design to test MI and MI plus feedback (MI+FB) interventions compared with an assessment-only condition (AO) in a sample of college freshmen. The design will evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and identify demographic and psychological profiles of students for whom the intervention seems to be successful versus those for whom it is less effective. The research will investigate the cost and cost-effectiveness of using MI approaches in college populations. Participants will be randomly assigned to MI, MI+FB, or AO conditions. All participants will provide data regarding drinking and related problems at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Analyses will focus on (a) determining the effectiveness of the interventions for reducing alcohol use and alcohol-related problems, (b) elucidating the mediational role of hypothesized mechanisms of change, and (c) testing the moderating impact of a number of individual and environmental characteristics. Findings will help to establish the efficacy of MI and MI+FB interventions for reducing heavy episodic drinking and related problems."
9717,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several respiratory diseases and disorders could be better and more widely treated with an effective and low-cost biomimetic lung surfactant (LS) replacement. In present medical practice, LS replacements (used predominantly to treat neonatal respiratory distress syndrome) derive from animal lungs, are expensive, and carry risks of viral transmission and immune response. We propose to continue the development of a novel class of functional mimics of the lung surfactant proteins based on poly-N-substituted glycines (peptoids), which are sequence-specific heteropolymers synthesized on solid phase, similarly to peptides. Peptoids are protease resistant, and with proper sequence design can form stable, helical secondary structures that resist non-specific aggregation. Over the past 3.5 years, we have created and studied two different, novel classes of helical, amphipathic peptoid oligomers with sequence and structural similarity to (1) SP-B (residues 1-25) and (2) SP-C (residues 5-32). In vitro biophysical studies of the surface activities of these peptoid-based SP mimics in an LS-like lipid film demonstrate that the best designs within each class of mimics perform similarly to the natural peptides they are designed to replace. While initial results are very promising, much work remains to be done to develop peptoid-based SP mimics for a clinically useful, biomimetic LS replacement. We must now gain a deeper understanding of structure-activity relationships for the two classes of amphiphilic peptoid SP mimics under study. We propose to do this by varying key structural features and performing detailed studies of the effects on surface activity, in parallel with Molecular Dynamics simulations. For SP-C mimics, we will study the effects of hydrophobic helix length, side chain chemistry and overall helicity, and will also mimic the palmitoylation of natural SP-C. Proposed SP-B mimics will have increasingly protein-like sequences and side chain chemistries, and we will test the hypothesis that dimerization will improve their activity. We will carry out in vitro studies of peptoid-containing surfactant using CD, pulsating bubble surfactometry, a Langmuir trough/Wilhelmy surface balance, fluorescence microscopy, unilamellar vesicles, and X-ray reflectivity/diffraction to map out structure-activity relationships and study peptoid-lipid interactions. We will investigate surfactant formulations containing mimics of both SPs, and we will study the bicompatibility and in vivo efficacy of peptoid surfactants with lung epithelial cells and animal models of RDS."
9728,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Receptors that mediate E. coli chemotaxis are paradigms for a large family of bacterial chemoreceptors and a larger family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic receptors. This proposal focuses on functional mechanisms in these receptors, specifically the relation of oligomeric organization to functional activity, the multiple interactions that control adaptational modification, and functional interactions among heterologous receptors. This focus is consistent with the NIGMS mission of basic research that increases understanding of life processes and lays the foundation for medical advances. Our work involves biochemical, genetic, biophysical and structural approaches plus collaborations with prominent biophysicists, biochemists and modelers. An emerging theme in biological molecular mechanisms is the importance of higher order interactions among proteins and complexes. Such interactions are central for bacterial chemotaxis. We propose to investigate the relation between receptor interactions and function by controlling in vitro the number of potentially interacting homodimers, the smallest unit of functional receptor structure. This control will be accomplished by isolating single or a small number of homodimers in Nanodiscs, water-soluble plugs of lipid bilayer surrounded by a protein annulus, a procedure we developed in a recent study. We will define the functional properties of isolated homodimers, providing a foundation for understanding functional consequences of higher order interactions. We will characterize the minimal receptor unit that activates the chemotaxis kinase, a unit our initial studies implied is 2-3 dimers. The results will define the core unit of the ternary signaling complex and identify features that require higher interactions. Given the potential of Nanodisc technology for studying chemoreceptors and other membrane proteins that form higher oligomers, we will optimize and characterize receptor-Nanodisc preparations. Receptor covalent modifications that mediate sensory adaptation are crucial for effective chemotaxis. They are controlled by multiple receptor-enzyme interactions in complex feedback loops. We will study these interactions using steady-state and transient-state kinetics, biochemical probes and mathematical plus structural modeling. A crucial interaction involves a pentapeptide connected to the receptor body by a polypeptide linker. The linker is required for effective adaptational modification. We will investigate the functional roles and postulated flexible nature of this linker by mutagenic manipulation, molecular modeling combined with experimental tests and EPR spectroscopy. We will characterize interactions among heterologous receptors using in vitro systems for adaptational assistance and for controlling the extent of influences on signaling among heterologous receptors. This research will increase our understanding of how interactions of individual molecules create complex functions. Similar phenomena, present in many life processes, are relevant to heath and disease."
9741,HHS,HHS,"Toxoplasma gondii infected cells exhibit a profound blockade of apoptosis that manifests at multiple points inthe apoptotic cascade. Our studies have shown an essential role for the hose transcription factor NFKB in theestablishment of the parasite-directed anti-apoptotic state. Activation of NFxB by diverse cellular pathwaysoccurs via the phosphorylation of specific Ser residues on its inhibitor kB. This phosphorylation event iscatalyzed by a unique cellular kinase complex defining the kB kinase signalosome (IKK). In T.gondiiinfected cells Phospho-kB localizes at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), the oraganelledefining the intracellular replication-permissive niche. The detection of P-kBat the PVM in cells devoid of allIKK activity suggested the presence of a parasite-encoded kinase (TglKK) is responsible. We find just suchan activity in parasite extracts and PVM-enriched fractions. We focus here on identifying the gene(s)encoding the TglKK activity and examining its role both in NFxB activation and the blockade of apoptosis.Our data indicate that TglKK activity alone is not sufficient to drive NFKB gene expression in cells withdefects in IKK. Initial studies examining the temporal nature of NFxB activation reveal a biphasic pattern ofNFKB expression suggesting independent, but temporally linked, contributions of the host and parasite IKKactivities. We propose to use host cell lines with specific lesions in patheways upstream of IKK, as well ascell lines  locked  into a defined expression profile, to better characterize the pertinent cellular pathwayssubverted by T.gondii infection. Finally, we have developed a genetic screen to identify parasite genesinvolved in NFKB activation. Initial results bear out the evidence that the mechanism to subvert NFKB ismultifactorial. Identification of these parasite genes and the elucidation of their roles in NFKB activation in thecontext of the studies on the cellular components will help define the signaling networks subverted by theparasite. Dissection of these pathways is particularly important given the targets of NFKB many of thecytokines implicated both in the pathogenesis of acute toxoplasmosis and the development of immunity tothe parasite."
9754,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antibodies specific for the carbohydrate antigen GaIalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GIcNAc-R (alphaGal) represent a major immunological hurdle to successful xenotransplantation of pig organs and tissues into humans, and play an important role in providing protective host immunity to various pathogens. However, in spite of the importance of antibodies specific for alphaGal , little is known about how production of these or other anticarbohydrate antibodies is regulated. In the past funding period, we successfully developed a gene therapy based approach to induce B cell tolerance to alphaGal in order to facilitate xenotransplantation, as well as develop a mouse model to study how production of alphaGal specific antibodies is regulated. Using knockout mice, which lack the enzyme that synthesizes alphaGal, and consequently produce aGal reactive natural antibodies, as do humans, we examined whether expression of a retrovirally transduced alphaGT in bone marrow-derived cells could be used to induce tolerance to alphaGal. Expression of alpha(1,3)galactosyltransferase in bone marrow-derived cells of knockout mice completely inhibited production of aGal specific antibodies, resulting in stable long-term tolerance to alphaGal. These data suggest that gene therapy approaches may be used to induce B cell tolerance, effectively reshaping the B cell repertoire. Using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells we also constructed novel immunoglobulin gene knock-in mice in which antibody variable region gene segments encoding aGal specific antibodies were introduced into the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain loci, on either an antigen deficient or antigen sufficient background. In this renewal, we will use these mice to address fundamental issues related to regulation of anti-carbohydrate antibodies.  The specific aims are to: 1) Characterize development and regulation of B cells producing aGal specific  antibodies; 2) Determine the mechanisms and requirements for anti-carbohydrate B cell tolerance; and 3) Determine the B cell receptor affinity which permits development of B cells that produce antibodies that bind self antigens. These studies should advance our understanding of how production of anti-carbohydrate is regulated, provide insight into how B cells producing antibodies with specificity for self-antigens escape negative selection, and may provide information critical to designing therapeutic agents that could be used to prevent or enhance production of anti-carbohydrate antibodies for clinical applications."
9756,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of dental fluorosis has increased significantly in recent decades, due primarily to the caries-preventive use of fluoride. The accepted tenet has been that dental fluorosis is a problem that results solely from excessive fluoride intake during the time of tooth development. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is also considerable individual variation in predisposition to fluorosis. In our work with the Iowa Fluoride Study (R01-DE09551), we have observed great variation in fluorosis severity within a given category of fluoride intake. The central hypothesis of this application is that dental fluorosis involves a complex interplay between individual genes (which set the threshold for development of fluorosis) and specific environmental exposures, including dietary patterns of fluoride intake and other nutrients. As part of the Iowa Fluoride Study, a large cohort has already been recruited and maintained for more than 13 years, with detailed longitudinal fluoride intake, dietary intake, and medication usage data, as well as surface-specific fluorosis phenotype data in the primary and mixed dentitions. As part of the Iowa Bone Development Study (R01-DE12101), which utilizes the Iowa Fluoride Study cohort, genetic material has been collected from over 600 cohort children and 970 parents, and genotypes are available for a substantial number of candidate genes potentially related to bone development. The subset of these genes is also reasonable candidates for roles in tooth morphogenesis and mineralization. The proposed secondary data analyses will examine these genes in light of dental fluorosis phenotypes, in order to identify specific genes/pathways that influence fluorosis, and to understand how these genes interact with fluoride and other factors (e.g., calcium intake, medications) to modify an individual's risk for dental fluorosis in both the primary and permanent dentitions. Genetic strategies include population- and family-based (child-parent trio) association studies with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as specific haplotype analyses. The proposed work will be the first human study to specifically assess genetic factors and gene-environment interaction in dental fluorosis development. The novel information obtained will also assist in planning future studies. Knowledge gained may lead to useful strategies to identify those at increased risk for fluorosis so that more individualized fluoride regimens can be developed and applied."
9877,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is for the continuation of an existing collaborative program that employs engineering techniques to better understand the mechanism of lens accommodation and its age-related changes leading to presbyopia. The general application of these bioengineering studies is the development and testing of suitable devices or surgical procedures for the restoration of true dynamic accommodation in presbyopes. This continuation proposes to apply a lens stretching system and numerical finite-element biomechanical model developed in the previous grant period to investigate specific age-related changes in the human and monkey lens and their impact on the feasibility of procedures to restore accommodation. There are four specific aims: Aim 1: To validate the lens stretcher for studies on human and monkey lenses Aim 2: To enhance and validate the biomechanical model for studies on human and monkey lenses Aim 3: To quantify the role of the age-related changes in lens shape and internal structure on the amplitude of accommodation in human and monkey lenses. Aim 4: To quantify the role of zonular architecture and tension on accommodation in human and monkey lenses. A lens stretching system and numerical finite-element model developed to characterize the optomechanical response of post-mortem lenses will be calibrated by comparison with published optical and biometric measurements obtained in live human and monkey eyes. The lens stretcher and biomechanical model will be used to determine the respective contribution of age related changes in lens shape and internal structure on the loss of accommodation with age, as well as the role of the zonular architecture. The results of the studies will be incorporated in a refined numerical finite- element optomechanical model of accommodation and presbyopia that will be used to simulate the effect of age-related changes on the biometric and optical response of the lens during accommodation, as well as the effect of surgical techniques to restore accommodation. t Relevance to Public Health: Presbyopia is the age-related gradual loss of the ability of the eye to focus on near objects. The percentage of presbyopes (age 45 and above) in the US population is predicted to reach 40% by 2011. Biomedical strategies that can restore accommodation will significantly improve the quality of life for these physically and socially active members of our society. This project seeks to improve our understanding of age-related changes in the eye leading to presbyopia and to test approaches to correct presbyopia."
9880,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The tears differ from most extracellular fluids in that the K+ concentration of tears is about 20 mEq/l. It is thought that the ducts of the lacrimal gland secrete K+; however, the mechanism of this secretion has not been fully elucidated, and the purpose of the high [K+] in tears with respect to its relationship to the cells of the ocular surface is unknown. The key hypotheses to be addressed are based on these observations: 1) Lacrimal gland ducts express K+ transporters and channels consistent with secretion of K+ by the ducts, 2) UV radiation causes opening of K+ channels and loss of K+ from corneal epithelial cells and this loss of K+ activates apoptotic pathways. 3) Elevating extracellular K+ ([K+]o) prevents activation of apoptotic pathways in lymphocytes. We propose that the lacrimal gland duct cells secrete fluid high in K+, which provides the ocular surface with an extracellular ionic environment that protects these cells from the deleterious effects of ambient levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The relatively high level of K+ in tears prevents the loss of intracellular K+ and the activation of apoptotic mechanisms when ocular surface cells are exposed to UV radiation. The specific aims of the proposed research are, 1) to determine, using patch clamp recording, whether K+ and Cl- channels, previously identified in lacrimal duct cells by microarrays and confocal microscopy are active in these cells. 2) To determine the role of elevated [K+] in tears, corneal epithelial cells will be exposed to UV radiation in the presence of varying [K+]o followed by measurement of cell viability, activation of apoptotic pathways and activity of ion channels, 3) To determine whether elevating [K+] in culture medium will promote the proliferation and viability corneal epithelial cells in culture. This study of the role of high potassium in tears will elucidate the relationship of the tears to the health of the eye in normal individuals and dry-eye patients. Everyone is exposed to ambient UV radiation and the proposed research will help to explain how the cornea protects the lens and retina from UV radiation while suffering minimal damage. In dry eye disease an inadequate tear film may make the cornea more susceptible to damage by UV radiation, thereby contributing to the disease process. If the high potassium in tears is important for the health of the ocular surface, this information will be useful in the development of improved treatments for dry eye disease."
9899,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation and inactivation are controlled by protein tyrosine kinase (i.e., JAK) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (i.e., SHP-2) activities, respectively. C-terminal region phosphorylated STAT dimerize and translocate into nuclei where it binds to DNA for transcriptional activation. To achieve maximum transcriptional activity, STAT needs to interact with other nuclear factors. Evidence from our laboratory shows that both p300/CBP and HDAC family members are capable of forming complexes with STAT3 but exert opposite effects on STAT3-dependent transcription: while p300/CBP enhances STATS's activity in transcription, overexpression of the HDAC family member HDAC3 in 293T cells was highly effective in blocking STAT3-dependent transcription. Thus, p300/CBP and HDAC activities may play key roles in regulating STAT3 activity. Recently, STAT3 has been found to play an important role in regulating cell migration and tumor metastasis although the mechanism has yet to be determined. In this regard, STAT3 constitutive phosphorylation has been widely detected in both metastatic and non-metastatic cells. Thus, an additional post-translational modification event seems to be required for STAT3 to regulate gene transcription relevant to acquisition of the metastatic phenotype. The overarching hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that STAT activity is under the control of acetylation and deacetylation mediated by HAT and HDAC, respectively. It is hypothesized further that constitutive STAT3 acetylation may play a central role in development of metastasis. To fully test these hypotheses, experiments will use our antibody array technology, specific gene-deficiency and/or down regulation, and mass-spectroscopy in order to: (1) explore HAT/HDAC as components of STAT3 signaling complex; (2) test STAT3 acetylation in STAT3 dimerization and resisting to inactivation/degradation; and (3) test the hypothesis that STAT3 acetylation plays a role in metastasis-related gene regulation and constitutive STAT3 acetylation is responsible for metastatic phenotype in vivo. These complimentary approaches will elucidate the role of uncontrolled STAT3 acetylation/deacetylation in causing cancer cell invasion and metasasis."
9906,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Non-small cell lung carcinoma is responsible for approximately 85% of lung cancer and existing treatments for patients with advanced disease remain only marginally effective. Agents directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor have been developed (EGFR). However, only 10-20% of patients with relapsed non-small cell lung cancer have a partial or complete response to treatment with the common EGFR inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib. Point mutations and deletions in EGFR are associated with clinical responses to gefitinib in nearly all patients. Tumor cell lines with EGFR mutations are also sensitive to gefitinib treatment in vitro. This proposal is to further characterize the mutations in the EGFR in the tumors and tumor cell lines from subjects with non-small cell lung cancer. Aim 1 will be to establish the frequency and type of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor in previously untreated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer prospectively entered into trials using epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. We have two patient cohorts of 135 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who are going to be studied. These cohorts will include those who respond to treatment, patients with stable disease, and patients with progressive non-small cell lung cancer. Aim 2 is to determine the relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor mutations, response to treatment, time to progression, and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. This will be done to determine if specific mutations give rise to different patient outcomes that include response, duration of response, and survival. We have assembled a consortium of investigators that have studied untreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer given single agent EGFR inhibitors to enable us to assemble multiple large groups of patients with responses and EGFR mutations. Aim 3 will be to study the tumors and tumor cell lines from patients with non-small cell lung cancer before and after treatment with EGFR inhibitors to determine the relationship between genetic changes and sensitivity and resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. NCI-H3255 and DFCI-LU- 011 are adenocarcinoma cell lines with EGFR mutations. Their sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors, downstream signaling events, and the mechanism of cell death compared to cell lines with wild type EGFR will be studied. These studies will provide guidance for future trials of EGFR inhibitors."
9940,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms through which sex hormones regulate the innate immune system in the female reproductive tract (FRT). Our overall hypothesis is that sex hormones regulate innate immune cell (epithelial, macrophage/dendritic cells, neutrophils and NK cells) defenses in the FRT which maintain a baseline of protection, in anticipation of probable pathogen entry, and respond to potential pathogens and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by (1) secreting antimicrobials, (2) producing cytokines and chemokines that recruit and activate immune cells and (3) alerting the adaptive immune system to invaders. Throughout this proposal we plan to test the hypothesis that estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) regulate innate immune responses (antimicrobials, cytokines, chemokines) and provide linkage to adaptive immunity that can lead to the protection of the reproductive tract against pathogens. The aims of the current research project are to answer the following questions: 1. Which antimicrobials, cytokines and chemokines are in FRT secretions during the estrous cycle and under hormonal control? 2. Does Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression vary with stage of the estrous cycle and is expression regulated by E2 and P? 3. Are innate immune responses to PAMPs regulated by E2 and P and if so, is regulation direct or mediated through stromal fibroblasts? 4. Which fibroblast growth factors mediate E2 and P control of innate immunity? 5. How do E2 and P influence antigen presentation in the uterus and vagina? We plan to investigate these questions using our in vivo and in vitro mouse model, since both are known to be responsive to sex hormones. Overall, these studies will increase our limited understanding of the role of sex hormones in regulating immune protection and should provide the basis of knowledge essential for understanding the role of hormones in the prevention and management of sexually transmitted diseases including the heterosexual transmission of HIV-1."
9951,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During embryonic development, the sexually indifferent gonad chooses between adopting an ovarian or testicular fate. In XY individuals, the testicular fate is initiated by a gene on the Y chromosome, Sry, that triggers a cascade of events leading to development of the testis. Although no single gene that triggers the ovarian pathway has been identified in XX individuals, several genes have been identified that are required not only for development of ovarian structures, but also for inhibiting the male pathway. The earliest known gene in the ovarian pathway is Wnt4. Mice deficient in Wnt4 show partial female-to-male sex reversal, and both loss and gain-of-function mutations of human WNT4 cause abnormal sexual development. The long- term goals of this proposal will be to elucidate the signaling pathways that drive the sexually indifferent gonad towards an ovarian fate. Specifically, we aim to understand three aspects of Wnt4 signaling. Wnt signals are transmitted through a family of frizzled receptors. In the first aim we will identify the frizzled receptor mediating the Wnt4 signal by determining the expression of these various receptors in the female gonad and then testing for a direct interaction with the WNT4 ligand. Recent data suggests that a canonical Wnt signaling mechanism involving Beta-catenin is not active in the XX gonad. Specific aim 2 will investigate the role of Wnt4 in activating various non-canonical signaling pathways. Using an established gonad culture system, we will test whether a Wnt-mediated calcium signal functions in the XX gonad. The activation of a non-canonical, dishevelled-mediated pathway will also be tested by looking for interactions between dishevelled and other downstream components of the pathway. XX gonads lacking Wnt4 will be used to confirm that these signals are dependent upon WNT4 signaling in vivo. In specific aim 3 we will address the inhibitory role of Wnt4 on the male pathway. Previous experiments suggest that Wnt4 antagonizes SOX9 stabilization by blocking the co-localization of FGFR2 in the nucleus. To test this hypothesis, we will generate a transgenic mouse that expresses Fgfr2 from the Sox9 promoter. This model will test the antagonistic action of WNT4 against maintenance of SOX9 in the presence or absence of FGFR2. These experiments will extend our understanding of the role Wnt4 plays in promoting ovarian development while simultaneously antagonizing testis differentiation. Not only will this work illuminate critical mechanisms of organogenesis, but it will also reveal molecular explanations for perturbations in sexual development in humans."
9955,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This research project is part of a larger effort to develop and investigate optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging technology for applications in gastrointestinal (Gl) endoscopy for the primary purpose of detecting dysplasia in common human pre-malignant Gl conditions. Dysplasia is the precursor of cancer in a number of Gl disorders, and is fundamentally a microscopic diagnosis based on specific changes in the cells and architecture of the mucosa. A key problem is that dysplastic Gl mucosa is usually not detectable by standard Gl endoscopy. Recent studies by the investigators have demonstrated that endoscopic OCT (EOCT) is capable of imaging Gl mucosa with unprecedented resolution and quality, and that the potential is strong for EOCT to become a powerful tool for diagnosis of dysplastic lesions. A significant limitation of the current EOCT prototype, however, is its limited field of view. It is not capable of imaging the entire circumference of the lumen of the gut, and is therefore not suitable for surveillance applications where comprehensive coverage of a segment of lumen is desirable. This proposal is focused on development and establishment of EOCT technology that will enable clinical trials of EOCT as a tool for surveillance in patients with premalignant Gl conditions. Dysplasia in Barrett's Esophagus is the primary clinical target for this project, and aberrant colonic crypt foci are the secondary target. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a new generation EOCT engine featuring improved resolution, improved image acquisition speed, and digital signal processing; (2) to develop EOCT probes to improve image resolution and to enable pull-back surveillance procedures; and (3) to refine the criteria for EOCT classification of dysplasia and develop efficient and accurate computeraided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms. The technology will be developed incrementally and will be rigorously characterized and calibrated and will be validated by careful in vitro and in vivo studies. Successful completion of this project will enable the clinical evaluation of technology that is expected to significantly improve the capacity to detect pre-malignant or early malignant lesions in the Gl tract and allow early therapeutic interventions that will positively impact on patient care and survival."
9957,HHS,HHS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The reaction of NO and NO-derived species with oxidizing lipids is kinetically rapid and exerts a multifaceted impact on cell and inflammatory signaling. NO-derived species have been shown to induce the nitration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, yielding allylic nitro derivatives (LNO2) that display receptor-ligand interactions, regulate the gene expression and tissue content of key inflammatory and cell signaling-related proteins and inhibit inflammatory cell function. Thus, nitrated lipids represent both products and mediators of inflammatory reactions. Since the lung is a rich source and vulnerable target of oxides of nitrogen, we propose to identify the generation and cell signaling actions of the principal nitrated lipids present basally and during clinically-relevant conditions of pulmonary inflammation, inhalation of oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO2) and exposure to gases that influence pulmonary oxidative/nitrative reactions (O2 and CO2). The hypothesis guiding the proposed research plan is that pulmonary exposure to NO-derived inflammatory oxidants yield nitrated lipid derivatives that modulate the resolution of pulmonary inflammation. The following Specific Aims will be pursued: 1. Quantify and characterize nitrated fatty acids in pulmonary cells and lung tissue. 2. Evaluate the mechanisms underlying the accumulation of pulmonary fatty acid nitration products. 3. Explore pulmonary cell signaling responses to nitrated fatty acids. The proposed research plan has thus been designed to focus on lipid reactions of NO and its products under biologically-, clinically- and toxicologically-relevant conditions and to define key signaling properties of nitrated lipid products in oxidative inflammatory lung injury and its resolution."
9972,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The search for genes causing essential hypertension has been ongoing for almost two decades, yet the identification of the effect of these genes and their genomic location has remained elusive.  The slow progress in finding genes that harbour susceptibility to essential hypertension has been attributed to the polygenic nature of essential hypertension and the confounding effects of aging and genetic - environmental interactions on the phenotypic expressions of this disorder.  Recent studies have indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are determinants in the aging process, are also major factors in the development and expression of essential hypertension.  One of these phenotypes is the sodium lithium countertransport (SLC).  As expressed in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immortalized lymphoblasts, the SLC is genetically associated and linked with loci harboring clusters of genes encoding enzymes that play key roles in glutathione metabolism.  Given that glutathione is at the center of the cellular defense against ROS, these genetic association/linkage findings are in line with the observations that: a) EBV immortalized lymphoblasts from hypertensive donors show an increase in ROS production, b) erythrocytes from hypertensive subjects show low glutathione level and an increase in the oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio, c) thiol metabolism modifies the activity of the SLC, and d) reduced glutathione levels in immortalized lymphoblasts enhances SLC activity.  The objectives of this project are as follows: 1.  Measure SLC activity in EBV immortalized lymphoblasts from 53 Utah families comprising 561 individuals; 2.  Perform genetic analysis using candidate genes and genome-scan approaches to elucidate genes that account for variations in SLC activity; 3.  Examine the relationship between SLC activity in EBV immortalized lymphoblasts and cardiovascular indices in the donors; and 4.  Explore the mechanisms that link the redox status of immortalized lymphoblasts with the SLC.  This will be done by manipulating ROS and glutathione levels in the immortalized lymphoblasts.  Results will enhance our understanding of genetic determinants of cardiovascular diseases, including essential hypertension, and provide a mechanistic perspective that links the pathophysiology of essential hypertension to the biology of ROS."
9984,HHS,NSF,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease are major public health problems facing our nation. Understanding the risk factors for progression of chronic renal insufficiency is a crucial but understudied area. The single most important known risk factor for progressive loss of renal function is the amount of proteinuria. However, whether the composition of proteinuria is prognostically important--over and above the quantity of proteinuria--is unknown. This study proposes to apply two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) to analyze the protein composition of stored urine specimens from subjects enrolled in the ongoing NIDDK-sponsored Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study. We will study 20 subjects with rapid loss of renal function and 20 subjects without, who are matched for major known risk factors for progression. The specific aims of the study are: 1) To perform 2-D DIGE on frozen urine samples from a large ongoing cohort study of chronic renal insufficiency patients; and 2) To compare the pattern of urine protein excretion defined by 2-D DIGE among subjects who have rapid rate of loss of glomerular filtration rate to the pattern among those who do not have rapid loss of glomerular filtration rate. Our goal is to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in the urine of subjects with rapid loss of renal function. This study is in response to NIDDK PAR-06-113  Pilot And Feasibility Clinical Research Grants In Kidney Or Urologic Diseases (R21).  We believe that this pilot study has the potential to generate exciting preliminary data that will lead to a large-scale study to define more fully how well levels of individual urine protein biomarkers predict loss of glomerular filtration rate. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our goal is to apply a new technique (2-D DIGE) to analyze the composition of urine protein to better predict which patients with chronic kidney disease will lose kidney function more rapidly. This will help doctors know which patients should be treated more intensely. Discovering new biomarkers will also advance understanding of why certain patients lose kidney function more rapidly and help devise new treatments."

The sustainability of water resources in arid environments will be evaluated in collaboration with researchers at the Desert Research Institute (DRI). Vegetation and hydrologic responses to varying precipitation patters will be evaluated in different desert environments (e.g. Majove vs. Sonoran desert). The facility will interface with large-scale studies at the University of Arizona?s Biosphere 2 which will be instrumental in predicting landscape processes. The upgrade will consist of repairs, instrumenting real-time lysimeter data streams, producing a web resource which will create an Instructional Environmental Observatory (IEO), and create a foundation for collaborative research on coupled soil hydrological and ecosystem processes in arid environments. Funding will be shared with PIs' startup monies. A part-time technician will be provided by the Department of Soil, Water & Environmental Science. Water issues in the desert southwest carry tremendous societal impacts. Pumping rates in arid regions vastly exceed recharge rates for sensitive aquifers. Education and outreach will be fostered through the creation of an IEO accessible by undergraduate and graduate students through research efforts and through courses in Soil & Environmental Sciences, Hydrology, Ecology, Natural Resources, and Engineering. The IEO will also be made available to the public and environment stakeholders.***"
10116,NSF,NSF,"This project explores the impact of geographically distributed 3D tele-immersive environments on dancers' creativity and their perception of themselves and each other. More specifically, the project will study the impact of digital options, such as scale and multiply, on the dancers' creative expression and improvisation. A formal notation, called a creativity graph, will be derived from a Laban movement analysis of the dancers' movement. A dancer develops a creative dance, a new sequence of phrases, when he/she generates a new association between two movement states (e.g. a new association between two Laban positions) based on some feedback from the immersive environment due to either invoking digital options or due to some unexpected performance of the system. This project will have a fundamental impact on our understanding of dancers' creativity within tele-immersive dancing environments and computing and will contribute a new concept of transformational movement graphs as a computational representation of dance creativity in distributed multi-site 3D tele-immersive spaces."
10119,NSF,HHS,"Trace metal sample handling and analysis have led to the discovery that tiny (nanomolar) levels of metals such as iron are having profound influences on the diversity, abundance, and carbon fixation of primary producers in the oceans. One of these important primary producers, marine cyanobacteria, have similarly been shown to be affected, positively and negatively, by copper (natural and anthropogenic) levels and may also be influenced by cobalt and nickel levels. At the same time, cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton are changing the distributions of metals and their reactivity through uptake, which causes measurable depletion of metals in surface waters, and through the extra-cellular production of metal binding ligands. Because of the importance of copper in aquatic environments, the PIs will characterize copper metabolism in marine cyanobacteria using model Synechococcus strains from oligotrophic environments and from coastal environments that have very different metal physiologies revealed by the whole genome sequencing projects. They will characterize how the strains respond to different copper levels using whole genome microarrays that probe the global response of the cell and will combine these studies with state of the art characterization of intracellular metal levels and other measures of cellular physiology and photosynthetic capacity. Molecular genetics studies of diverse copper associated genes will be undertaken to determine their function in the cell. Preliminary results have found a potential candidate for an intracellular copper binding protein that is conserved in all marine cyanobacteria. At the same time, preliminary results have found that coastal cyanobacteria have greater resistance to copper than open ocean species and this might be due to a novel copper binding or efflux system. The PIs will illustrate the importance of copper in aquatic environments by developing hands-on lab components that will communicate some basic concepts around metal nutrition/pollution in the marine environment to middle school students. This will be undertaken in collaboration with Aquatic Adventures, who provide educational programs that connect underserved youth to science.Broader Impacts This research will reveal some of the major mechanisms by which marine cyanobacteria have adapted to metal levels in coastal and oligotrophic environments. Thus these results will help us understand the distribution and diversity of these organisms in relation to global primary productivity. They should lead to more robust biomarkers for metal stress and pollution in coastal environments. The PIs will expand on a previous outreach activity like their museum exhibit on marine genomics at the Birch Aquarium, La Jolla CA, by developing hands-on lab components that will communicate some basic concepts around metal nutrition/pollution in the marine environment to middle school students. This will be undertaken in collaboration with Aquatic Adventures, who provide educational programs that connect underserved youth to science, inspire environmental action, and increase exposure to marine habitats. In addition an undergraduate and graduate student in the interdisciplinary field of the metal physiology of microbes will be trained."
10161,NSF,HHS,"This is a five-year project aimed at organizing a DRK-12 Resource Network to provide assistance for projects in areas such as research and development methods, implementation, and analysis procedures; synthesis of findings across the portfolio of projects; and national dissemination of the R&D contributions of the DRK-12 program. To accomplish these goals, Education Development Center (EDC) will join efforts with Abt Associates Inc., and Policy Studies Associates to implement three major strands: (1) Technical Assistance, which consists of (a) a portfolio assessment to define it in terms of composition and major characteristics and identify project needs, (b) individual technical work services to project leadership, (c) focus groups, (d) thematic meetings, (e) Principal Investigators (PI) meetings, and (f) a web portal; (2) Portfolio Analysis, including (a) synthesis activities to capture a comprehensive view of the portfolio in order to understand the role that the program has played in advancing K-12 student and teacher learning, and (b) evaluative studies of selected projects describing specific contributions to the field; and (3) Dissemination, comprising (a) the development of a white paper to summarize research findings on dissemination and implementation of research in practice and policy settings and highlight examples from the portfolio, and (b) a series of dissemination-related workshops."

10197,NSF,HHS,"The University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) will bring together an experienced group of evolution educators in order to inform the development and maintenance of an effective resource for improving evolution education at the college level. This effort falls under the umbrella of UCMP's highly successful Understanding Evolution (UE) project (http://evolution.berkeley.edu), which currently receives over one million page requests per month during the school year. UE was originally designed around the needs of the K-12 education community; however, increasingly, the site is being used by the undergraduate education community. UCMP intends to embark on an effort to enhance the utility of the UE site for that population, increase awareness of the site at the college level, and secure the project's future so that it can continue to serve K-16 teachers and students. To inform and guide these efforts, UCMP proposes to establish and convene a UE Advisory Board, which will be charged with helping to: (1) identify the characteristics and needs of college-level target learners and their instructors with respect to evolution, (2) articulate the recommended components for expanding the UE site to include an Undergraduate Lounge in which students and their instructors will be able to access a variety of resources for increasing understanding of evolution, (3) develop a strategic plan for increasing awareness of UE within the undergraduate education community, and (4) develop a strategic plan for maintenance and continued growth of the UE site."
10217,NSF,NSF,"An important kind of virtual research organization is the project-based research collaboration involving researchers from different institutions. The project provides a scientific grounding for managing, evaluating, and predicting success in distributed research collaborations. Collaborative success depends on whether investigators have a productive climate: a social and technical context that supports performance and innovation. In a productive climate, collaborators perceive they have resources to collaborate effectively; they see a link between their achievements and rewards they receive; they experience their group as flexible and welcoming of innovative approaches; and they note minimal conflict between the collaboration and their career and their institution's values. The research defines and measures a productive climate of distributed research collaborations and focuses on a key antecedent of a productive climate: the institutional environment of the collaboration. One example of this kind of environment is whether the institutions that employ the investigators see exceptional value in interdisciplinary research and have developed practices that support this kind of research.The investigators study the institutional environments of a sample of projects that were supported by the National Science Foundation. The intellectual contribution of this work includes documenting the importance of a productive climate for distributed research collaboration, and tracing the linkages among productive climate and the institutional environments of these collaborations. This analysis led to better metrics for measuring and predicting performance and innovation in collaborations. Identifying the institutional factors that predict the productive climate and outcomes of research collaborations also permit the development of models to predict which collaborations are likely to be successful. The broader impacts of this project are to inform university, agency, and regulatory practices and policies for science and new forms of interdisciplinary, distributed research collaboration."
10224,NSF,NSF,"The surge in the introduction of new products coupled with the significant reduction in time from product design to manufacturing, as well as the ever increasing customer's expectation for high reliability and longer warranties have prompted industry to shorten its product test duration.  In many cases, the testing of the products prototypes can take months and even years before actual production takes place.  In many situations, accelerated life testing which subjects the product samples to extreme conditions might be the only viable approach to assess whether the product meets the expected long term reliability requirements.  As a result, the accuracy of reliability estimates from such testing has a profound effect on the subsequent decisions regarding system configuration, warranties and preventive maintenance schedules.  Inappropriate implementation of the test might cause delays in product release, termination of the entire product or catastrophic failures in the actual use of the product.  In a variety of industrial applications, there could be many choices in stress loadings when conducting testing.  Each stress loading has some advantages and drawbacks.  This has raised many practical questions regarding the equivalence among various accelerating test plans involving different stress loadings.  The problem becomes more difficult when multiple stresses are involved.  To overcome these challenges, we propose to investigate and contribute fundamental and theoretical models and provide several statistical tools to facilitate practical reliability tests. New framework for planning accelerated testing under various stress loadings, especially under complex stress and multiple stresses conditions, will be established. If successful, the research results will fill a major gap in reliability assessment needed by industry.  Especially, the results will enable industry to design efficient and economical test plans, yet the results of the test will provide accurate reliability estimates.  The tools to be developed will facilitate and further promote the implementation of accelerated life testing in modern industry."
10271,NSF,HHS,"Innovation is becoming more open, often involving multiple organizations in a division of innovative labor (DoIL).  The division of innovative labor in the economy is conceived of as the distribution across firms and other organizations of the following steps in the innovation process: 1) research/idea generation; 2) development; and 3) commercialization.  Despite its importance, there is little broad-based, systematic evidence on the extent or nature of the DoIL, nor on its impact on firm performance or the rate of technical advance.  The project collects the first systematic data on the DoIL for the United States by surveying over 20,000 firms in manufacturing and selected service industries,.   The collected data quantifies key features of the DoIL.  It also provides the basis for developing and empirically testing models of the DoIL and its effects on innovative performance.  The project addresses a number of important questions, such as the extent to which startups, as compared to established firms, are generators of new ideas, the importance of universities as sources of industrial innovation, and the extent to which firms' use of external knowledge inputs increases their innovative performance. Finally, the research advances the economics of innovation by generating formal models that capture the DoIL and testing those models empirically.Broader Impacts: This project is the first national effort to collect data on innovative activity generally, going beyond R&D and patenting. It is an important addition to the data infrastructure required for a science of science and innovation policy.  By generating new data on innovative activity, creating new metrics, and developing new models of the innovation process, the research also informs both public policy and firm strategy.  The research should contribute to deliberations on intellectual property policy and policies on standards and cooperative research and development agreements that potentially affect the growth of technology markets and the DoIL.  By highlighting the role of small firms, startups, and universities in the innovation process, the findings should also help inform federal support to university research and new firm formation.  The project findings should also contribute to the federal government's ongoing efforts to improve its collection of data on industrial R&D and innovation.  The research also contributes to the management of innovation by highlighting the returns to extramural knowledge sourcing, or strategic alliances formed to develop or commercialize new technologies."
10283,NSF,HHS,"This interdisciplinary research project, funded by the Science, Technology, and Society Program, seeks to better understand the social consequences of surveillance.  The growing prevalence of surveillance, facilitated by increasingly sophisticated information technologies, is well documented. However, the social implications for democratic societies of so much tracking, monitoring, and sorting of individual behavior is less well-understood.  At the same time, interest in transparency policies is growing in calls for more transparency of government and corporate practices.  Transparency is seen as a remedy for the negative effects of surveillance.  This project reframes surveillance and transparency in viewing them both as systems of accountability.  Accountability provides a novel lens through which to view the normative structures of these two systems and will be understood to involve: (1) an individual or organization; (2) an account of that individual or organization, focused on a particular domain of activity; and (3) a group, organization, or individual that uses the account to make decisions.  Further, surveillance and transparency will be analyzed as sociotechnical systems: the social structures and cultural meanings constitute, and are in turn constituted by, the information technology systems in which they are realized.  This framework will guide the creation of five case studies which will provide the basis for analysis and cross-comparison.  The five cases cover government, corporate and non-profit organizations.  An interdisciplinary team of scholars will analyze the cases and do the cross-case comparisons, yielding both new insights into transparency and new understandings of the social implications of surveillance.  These analyses will examine how the rationales for creation of systems gets translated into their actual workings; how IT has an impact on that translation; and how the systems affect underrepresented groups in science and engineering."
10286,NSF,NSF,"The exchange of carbon between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is a critical component of the global carbon cycle.  Movement of terrestrial carbon from land to water represents a loss of carbon from the former and a gain for the latter, and these changes must be taken into account when determining the net carbon balance of either system.  In most terrestrial carbon cycle studies, the magnitude of this loss has not been determined, possibly resulting in an over-estimation of carbon storage in the terrestrial system.  If the carbon that enters the aquatic system is eventually respired, or lost to the atmosphere, then this is a potentially serious error in calculations of regional and global carbon cycling.  The specific goal of this project is to determine the age of terrestrially-derived carbon from forests in Massachusetts and the subsequent metabolic fate of this carbon in adjacent aquatic systems over seasonal and annual cycles.  A multi-disciplinary approach will employ a variety of biochemical and analytical techniques to determine the age and fate of soil carbon.  The research will have important implications for decision makes and managers who are interested in maximizing net carbon storage within particular regions.  Outreach efforts will focus on the concept of connectivity between inland ecosystems and downstream estuaries and the coastal zone.  The focus will be on improving the coverage of concepts and topics in aquatic ecology in curricula for K-12 education.  The principle investigator is partnered with the Math and Science Center of Virginia.  Three teacher-student teams consisting of one high school biology or earth science teacher and four 10th grade students, with priority given to students from under-represented groups, will participate in a  two-week, field-oriented institute to educate and provide research experiences."

Predictivecomputational simulation may be the only means to account for the lack ofcomplete characterization of the subsurface environment, the multiple scales ofthe various interacting processes, the large areal extent of saline aquifers,and the need for long time predictions.  This proposal will investigate highfidelity multiscale and multiphysics algorithms necessary for simulation ofmultiphase flow and transport coupled with geochemical reactions and relatedmineralogy, and geomechanical deformation in porous media to predict changes inrock properties during sequestration.

10319,NSF,HHS,"Scientists and supporters of science have long worked to improve the sharing, reuse, storage, and retrieval of scientific data.  Today, efforts focus on advanced  cyberinfrastructure : using networked computers, databases, and organizations to bridge divides among diverse scientific disciplines.  Cyberinfrastructure divides into three main activities. First, large numbers of automatic sensors monitor subjects of interest, such as ecosystems and Earth's climate, producing massive volumes of digitized data.  Second, in many fields computer models have replaced laboratory experiments as the principal means of data collection, prediction, and decision-making.  Third, increasingly vast data resources (scientific memory) are now available, but are often distributed across thousands of research sites and institutions, in numerous incompatible formats.  For cyberinfrastructure-enabled science to deliver on its transformative potential, cyberinfrastructure designers need better ways of understanding how scientists actually create and share data in practice, and how they use it to create new knowledge.  To investigate data practices empirically, this project examines four large cyberinfrastructure efforts: the Long Term Ecological Research Network, the Center for Embedded Network Sensing, the WATer and Environmental Research Systems Network, and the Earth System Modeling Framework.  In each case, the investigators will study how cyberinfrastructure is used in monitoring, modeling, and memory.  These projects spread across many disciplines addressing three important domains, all related to climate change concerns: ecology and environment; hydrology and water management; and earth system science.  In conducting the project, the investigators will develop innovative methods of distributed ethnography, collaborative history, and multimodal network analysis.  In addition to published findings, the project will produce a 'best practices' handbook meant to guide data practices and coordination in cyberinfrastructure.  The project will partner with organizations working to enhance the role of women in computing; to build database systems for American Indian communities; and to engage other groups often ignored in information infrastructure development.  The project will thus lay groundwork for an inclusive, theoretically rich, and practically engaged social science of cyberinfrastructure."
10370,NSF,NSF,"A theoretical research and training program is proposed in the fundamental area of growth of unstable interfaces and related problems, a fast developing area in contemporary research. The growth of an interface is said to be unstable if a smooth initial interface eventually develops a fractal structure.  Under this umbrella one studies important and distinct phenomena such as growth of bacterial colonies and cancer cells, dynamics of chemical reaction, propagation of crystallization fronts, dynamics of the Quantum Hall droplets, transport of 1D fermions, Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA), surface instabilities in hydrodynamical flows, Integrable Models, and 2D Quantum Gravity and Matrix Models.  Laplacian Growth (LG) is the simplest nontrivial model of such unstable growth. In LG the velocity of the interface is proportional to the gradient of some scalar field with an additional condition of incompressibility. This scalar field can represent very different physical quantities such as electrostatic field, food concentration, or a pressure field. It is an excellent context in which to study the general phenomena of unstable growth. The proposed project looks beyond current LG formalism to the possibility of using symmetries and the introduction of stochastic noise to the problem, making it more realistic and relevant. It will allow one to: i) consider the selection problem in any geometry of Laplacian Growth as a problem of stability against stochastic noise; ii) introduce new formalisms for the growth more closely connected to experiment; iii) approach the problem of finding the (multi)fractal properties of the interface; iv) formulate the Laplacian Growth as a Hamiltonian problem.Broader impact: 1. LG and DLA are good research area for graduate and undergraduate students to be introduced into nonlinear dynamics, Integrable Models, and other contemporary areas of mathematics and physics.  It will allow a student to see the effects of nonlinear couplings, see the emergence of new fundamental dynamical properties which arise due to stochasticity. The student will gain an experience in interdisciplinary research.  2. The PI and the students will publish in peer reviewed journals and give presentations at conferences. In addition the PI will use every opportunity for media appearances and public lectures to communicate the results to a broader public.  3. The proposed research will contribute to the development of a better understanding of the dynamics of growth of unstable interfaces in all the applications mentioned above.  These areas are of the great importance for the technology, medicine, and environmental studies."
10377,NSF,NSF,"To sustainably meet the simultaneous and growing demands for water, energy, and environmental quality while protecting the welfare and tradition of affected communities, a broader view of dams is needed.  To address this need, this interdisciplinary research project will apply a new tool for evaluating the relative costs and benefits of dam construction based on multi-objective planning techniques. The Integrative Dam Assessment Modeling (IDAM) tool is designed to integrate biophysical, socioeconomic, and geopolitical perspectives into a single cost/benefit analysis of dam construction.  Each of 27 different impacts of dam construction will be evaluated both objectively (e.g., flood protection) and subjectively (i.e., the valuation of said flood protection) by a team of decision makers.  By providing a visual representation of the costs and benefits associated with two or more dams, the IDAM tool will allow decision makers to evaluate alternatives and to articulate priorities associated with a dam project, making the decision process more informed and more transparent.  The IDAM tool will be an evolutionary step in dam evaluation.  Coupled with event chronologies and hotspot mapping of conflicts, household surveys, public-participatory geographic information systems, and hydrologic modeling, the proposed process will be used to investigate hypotheses regarding the assessment, minimization, and distribution of hydropower impacts across cultural and organizational levels and to engage stakeholders in the design process through a decision theater.Significant intellectual contributions of this project will include the use of a uniquely multidisciplinary, integrative model to understand the effects of dams through a controlled study of a complex social and environmental system in China.  The project will make several pragmatic contributions related to policy and decision making through disciplinary and interdisciplinary investigation.  The project therefore will increase understanding about the interplay of multiple impacts of dam construction in a variety of geographic contexts.  Because this collaborative effort will includes opportunities for research in undergraduate institutions, this project will support high-quality research by faculty members at two undergraduate institutions and encourage the integration of research and education.  Substantial coordination and capacity building will occur across organizations, levels of experience, and disciplines.  A broad dissemination strategy is aimed at strengthening research, teaching, and public outreach about society environment interactions in the U.S., Asia, and elsewhere.  Finally, this decision-support process will yield both new knowledge and accessible tools for improving institutions' ability to manage the social and environmental dynamics associated with dams as agents of change.

10386,NSF,NSF,"Whereas all nations are exposed to the same dominant scientific consensus established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, their reactions to this knowledge are highly variable.  National stances toward global climate change cannot be explained by levels of prosperity or immediate vulnerability to disaster.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine the key sociopolitical variables that affect how national polities react to scientific knowledge.  Multiple constituencies form networks of action that effect national policies.  Countries vary in the extent to which leaders of government, non-governmental organizations, businesses, and other influential actors take the scientific claims seriously, assigning high levels of risk and urgency to the problem and developing countermeasures.  Advocacy coalitions for and against remedial action vary in strength in each national context.  Their beliefs, activities, and effectiveness reflect concepts of organizational and national interest and cultural receptiveness to scientific reasoning.  Domestic scientific establishments vary in their capacity to certify climate science claims and diffuse this knowledge.  Among these multiple groups, opportunities for cross-stakeholder participation and dialogue will strengthen national agreement, empower authorities, and lead to more effective national countermeasures.  This project will compare the climate change policy-formation processes of developed (Japan, the United States, Germany, and Sweden), transitional (Russia), and developing countries (India, China, and Brazil) as well as at the international level.  Policy network analysis will be used to study these relational processes.  Comparable surveys in each country will collect data on networks of negotiation, communication, and support among pertinent domestic and international organizations as well as organizational beliefs, goals, resources and policy engagement.  Data collection will take place in 2009-2010 at the height of international negotiations over the post-Kyoto global climate change regime.This project will contribute significantly to knowledge about climate change politics and decision making while also strengthening climate change educational capacity in all the countries, especially in the developing and transition countries.  Women lead four of the nine case research teams, which include multiple ethnic/racial groups and will strive for inclusion of national minorities.  Each team will establish a national center for sociopolitical research, education, training, and public information on climate change.  The teams and centers will form an enduring global network and scientific community, holding regular conferences and workshops and issuing reports and publications.  The project plans repeated surveys at regular intervals.  The resulting public data base will provide an invaluable record of changing national and international reactions to global climate change for future scholarly research.  An award resulting from the FY 2008 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards."
10392,NSF,HHS,"There are two problems suggested in this proposal for further investigation. The first problem is completing our understanding of the deformation space of hyperbolic structures on open 3-manifolds and describing the geometry of such structures. This problem has been the subject of many studies started by Bill Thurston and followed by Bonahon, Canary, Minsky, Brock and others. Their work provided very interesting results especially in the case of incompressible boundary 3-manifolds. However such a nice description does not exist in general for hyperbolic structures on other 3-manifolds and in particular handlebodies. Namazi will focus on deepening our understanding of this general case. The second problem deals with the geometry of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A very fundamental problem in the subject is to describe the geometry of a hyperbolic manifold and find a recipe to construct a very accurate approximation for the hyperbolic metric. These two problems are very closely related to each other and in earlier work Namazi was able to construct models for the geometry of a large class of hyperbolic structures on handlebodies and this was used to construct accurate approximations of the hyperbolic metric on a family of closed 3-manifolds. The hope is to extend this to a broader set of closed 3-manifolds.A 3-manifold is an object, which looks like the regular Euclidean 3-dimensional space around every point. The problem of classifying 3-manifolds has been one of the fundamental questions in mathematics, which perhaps started by Poincare's work and conjecture in the early twentieth century. Thurston pushed the subject much further and conjectured that understanding and classifying hyperbolic 3-manifolds results in a classification of all 3-manifolds. The recent development of the subject in the last few years has brought us closer than ever to see a complete proof of Thurston's conjecture. A consequence of this classification is the fact that these fundamental objects have an almost canonical shape. What remains unanswered is a description of this shape and this is the major subject that Namazi will try to address in this project. Similar to his earlier work he also expects that such a description makes it possible to answer many unanswered questions in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds."
10450,NSF,NSF,"This project will continue research on the development and applications of new reactions involving organoiron complexes discovered in the Principal Investigator's laboratory.   Specifically, the scope of cyclocoupling reactions between a diene complexed with an iron tricarbonyl group and an alkene, the formal [6+2] ene reactions, will be studied.  This reaction type is unique to iron tricarbonyl complexes and requires the stoichiometric use of the organometallic group to prevent competing intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions.  The application of an asymmetric double version of this ene reaction, carried out in a tandem manner, will be explored as an approach to the chemical synthesis of 18-deoxycytochalasin H, which is of interest as an HIV protease inhibitor.  A variant of this [6+2] ene reaction in which the pendant alkene is replaced by aldehyde and imine functionality, which broadens the scope of the process, will also be studied.  Application of tandem alkene/aldehyde [6+2] ene reactions to the chemical synthesis of magellaninone, a structurally complex lycopodium alkaloid natural product, will be pursued as a long term future goal.With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Anthony J. Pearson of the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University.  Professor Pearson's research efforts revolve around the development of metal-mediated reactions for the formation of C-C bonds.  Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as the readily available iron is used as the active metal that mediates the key reactions.  Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries."

Prior to commencing thefull-year research experience, students take calculus,differential equations, linear algebra, and a new sophomorecourse in scientific and mathematical computing which wasdeveloped with this project in mind and is offered to all mathmajors.  Special efforts are made to recruit minorities andwomen, who are underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. The year of research begins in the Spring semester of thestudents' junior year with: a support course that providesbackground on the theme that unifies all the research projectsfor that year (e.g.  stochastic processes in 2009); a team-taughtcourse on the tools and methods of computational research;regular meetings with the research project mentor; and the firstpart of a seminar that runs throughout the year.  Researchcontinues through the summer, and students write an honors thesisor a paper for publication in the Fall.

10488,NSF,NSF,"The Division of Materials Research and the Physics Division contribute funds to this award.  This award supports theoretical research at the interface between physics and the biological sciences.  The PI will use the tools of statistical physics to investigate biological networks. The research may have impact on our broader understanding of networks more generally. Behind the enormous diversity and complexity of the biological world lie ?universal? principles at and across various scales and levels of organization. These principles help us to simplify and demystify the complexity that is otherwise difficult to comprehend. Functional robustness as a prerequisite of biological systems may place fundamental constraints on the underlying design of the biological networks. The proposed project explores this possibility by using concepts and tools in statistical mechanics and focusing on a set of specific biological systems. The PI will explore whether and how a network?s topology is dictated by the requirement of robustness for a given function, which part of the topology is ?universal? and which part is variable, and whether sense can be made of the design of the biological networks in this context. A significant part of the proposed research is to construct coarse-grained models and to analyze network ensembles. Insights from modeling at proper coarse-grained levels play a unique role in our understanding of the complex biological systems.  A deeper understanding about the function-topology relationship in biological circuits may have impact on the emerging field of synthetic biology. The general approach developed here may also be applicable to other network systems, such as ecological and social networks.This research project offers a valuable interdisciplinary educational experience. It will be integrated into the PI?s on-going effort in the curriculum development and training for a new generation of scientists with skills that cross disciplinary boundaries. The project can be naturally divided into small pieces suitable for students of different backgrounds and academic stages. It will involve lab rotation students, under-represented students, as well as international collaboration and student exchange. NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:The Division of Materials Research and the Physics Division contribute funds to this award.  This award supports theoretical research at the interface between physics and the biological sciences.  The PI will use the tools of statistical physics to investigate biological networks. Biological systems exhibit the property of robustness ? they are remarkably resistant to particular stress from the environment. The PI aims to gain insight how imposing the property of robustness constrains networks. Is there a fundamental principle that helps us to cut through the complexity of, say, a cellular network and better understand its structure and interconnections? Could the same principle help us to better understand complex networks of entangled large molecules ? polymer systems, or the power grid? This research may have impact on our understanding of networks more generally. This research project offers a valuable interdisciplinary educational experience. It will be integrated into the PI?s on-going effort in the curriculum development and training for a new generation of scientists with skills that cross disciplinary boundaries. The project can be naturally divided into small pieces suitable for students of different backgrounds and academic stages. It will involve lab rotation students, under-represented students, as well as international collaboration and student exchange."
10515,NSF,HHS,"Two related research projects will investigate cognition across undergraduate geology majors, geology graduate students, and professional geologists. The field-based studies involve authentic tasks commonly used by students and professional geoscientists. Navigation (GPS) as well as cognitive (maps, audio logs, and debriefing interviews) data will allow the investigators to study complex natural problem solving. The laboratory studies involve a series of cognitive tasks that allow the investigation of working memory function, perceptual abilities, and the structuring of domain-specific content knowledge. The investigators expect to produce: (1) Valid and reliable methods for investigating field-based geologic cognition and navigation, which could allow for field-based cognitive data to be readily collected from large numbers of students enrolled in field courses; (2) New laboratory-based cognitive experiments that push the boundaries of existing knowledge about the cognitive processes underlying the learning and teaching of complex geoscience content, which will bridge the geoscience education and cognitive science literatures on STEM learning; and (3) A theoretical model for geocognition derived from empirical data that describes how cognitive processes manifest and change as students progress toward expertise, which will provide a foundation for research-based instructional design and teaching in the geosciences."

This project  will make significant progress on problems  originating in geometry and theoretical  computer science. Each of the questions will be approached using  techniques that lie on the interface of 3 areas of mathematics:  differential  geometry (submanifolds, exterior differential systems),  algebraic geometry (projective varieties, geometric aspects of commutative algebra) and representation theory (orbit closures, Lie algebra cohomology,  invariant theory).  We emphasize that this synthesis yields a  cross-pollination that significantly increases the richness, value an  influence of the results.  Landsberg and Robles will continue work related to (1) the Hwang-Mok  program on Fano varieties in algebraic geometry, (2) the  P = NP? problem in  complexity theory, and (3) the geometric structure of orbits in  representation theory.  These seemingly disparate projects are unified by  the Principle Investigators' approach.  In each case there is an underlying  differential geometry of lines on (and osculating to) a projective variety.  A through understanding of this geometry will deepen our understanding of  (and in some cases solve) these problems.  This geometry is studied via  techniques drawn from differential geometry, algebraic geometry and  representation theory.  While the geometric and representation theoretic  tools used  are classical, the implementation and resulting applications are  innovative and originated with the principal investigators. Additional  projects include: (1) A study of varieties in spaces of tensors.  This work  draws on geometry and representation theory, and will have applications to  statistics, computer science and complexity theory. (2) Calibrated  geometries.

10546,NSF,HHS,"The grape and wine industry is an international global marketplace with a competitive high-value product. The issues facing the grape and wine industry cut across national boundaries and involve problems with berry quality, disease pressures, and climate change. In response to these global issues, the grape community developed the International Grape Genome Program (IGGP) to promote international collaboration and the placement of genomic data into the public domain to rapidly advance grape genomic studies. With the sequencing of the grapevine genome completed, the IGGP steering committee has identified the development of functional genomic platforms, bioinformatics, and the synchronization of funding between different international parties as high priorities. This Research Coordination Network (RCN) project represents an excellent opportunity to help address the identified issues. Our objectives are 1) to coordinate grape functional genomic research among US grape researchers and 2) to articulate and coordinate US research with international initiatives by:1. Facilitating the development of non-redundant functional genomic resources in grape through scientific exchange and dialog to improve production efficiency and quality of grape products.2. Establishing institutional collaborations and partnerships among American, French, Italian, South African, Canadian, Spanish, Australian and other international institutes including exchanges of scientists and students between institutes for research and education, and attendance at international and virtual conferences and workshops that are focused on networking activities and grape functional genomics.The RCN steering committee will organize workshops, conferences and scientific exchanges between US labs and between US and international labs, which will be advertised on the IGGP web site (www.vitaceae.org), in order to facilitate national and international grape research and communication along with the enhancement of the education of early career scientists. The establishment of collaborations between the US and international institutes and universities will provide complementation of the strengths of each institute for a synergistic stimulation of research, education and progress towards understanding berry development, the influence of the environment on grape quality, and the human-health benefits associated with many grape metabolites. The long-term benefits of this project will be to expand and foster international partnerships with other institutes and universities from other countries in the interest of improved economic development and international relations throughout the world."
10551,NSF,HHS,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION  Piezoelectric materials are critical for applications in sensors and actuators that enable medical ultrasound, therapies that promote bone healing, highly efficient portable power transformers, high performance diesel engines and many other applications involving conversion between electrical and mechanical energy.  The goal of this research team is to improve our understanding of piezoelectrics by fully optimizing existing materials and enabling enhanced potential for industrial development of environmentally friendly, lead free piezoelectrics.  The research project will also be directed towards developing educational materials on the science and engineering of piezoelectrics for students from middle school to beginning college.  The educational materials will be used to enhance skill development in math and science and to foster interest in science and engineering. TECHNICAL DETAILS: Exploration of crystallographic texture with domain orientation and anisotropy in poled, lead free piezoelectrics enables understanding of the interrelationships between texture and microstructure that can lead to replacement of lead-containing piezoelectrics. This project will couple domain textures and crystallographic textures in bulk materials to understand the development of piezoelectric and other anisotropic properties.  Effects of poling field, poling temperature, conductivity and intrinsic materials properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, elasticity and thermal expansion are critical aspects for developing this understanding. The project consists of development of processing approaches to produce bulk materials that can be used to fully describe the interplay between texture and anisotropy in the rapidly evolving classes of lead free piezoelectric materials.  Project investigators are considering nanoscale and microscale interactions between ferroelastic and ferroelectric domains across grain boundaries as a function of stress state, temperature and processing history via scanned surface probe techniques.  The experimental aspects are pivotal to describing the relationship of texture and microstructure to properties for comparison to incisive microstructure-based numerical simulations that capture the thermodynamics and physics occurring on the scale of the domains and grains. Both the experimental and computational aspects of this project will be carried out in collaboration with colleagues in the automobile and diesel engine industries and at the Technical University of Darmstadt.  This project is producing a better understanding of poling processes, the limitations imposed on poling by the underlying ferroelastic and ferroelectric domains and their interactions with grain boundaries and microstructure. Undergraduate and graduate student researchers are learning advanced techniques for numerical simulation of nanoscale and microscale effects on properties, sample preparation techniques for surface probe analysis and electron microscopy, surface probe techniques, electron microscopy and x-ray and neutron diffraction techniques."
10560,NSF,NSF,"Ocean sciences faculty and educators in the University of Hawaii system and the Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence California (COSEE CA) propose a new collaboration to extend the COSEE CA courses Communicating Ocean Sciences (COS) and Communicating Ocean Sciences for Informal Audiences (COSIA) to the Central Pacific region. The new project, Pacific Ocean Literacy for Youth, Publics, Professionals and Scientists (POLYPPS), will be based in Hawaii. It will focus on training educators and scientists to effectively communicate ocean sciences to a multi-ethnic population within a range of cultural contexts. Lead by the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), POLYPPS is a collaboration with a broad set of partners, including universities, community colleges, research institutes, professional societies, aquariums, museums, community organizations, governmental agencies, and private companies. The partners advocate that education in the ocean sciences should involve teaching students to apply ocean literacy concepts and use inquiry-based leaning to improve not only their own lives but also their local, national, and global communities. The primary objective of the POLYPPS collaboration with COSEE CA reflects the COSEE network's mission of integrating research and education in the ocean sciences. Intellectual Merit: POLYPPS will engage researchers, educators and a range of community partners in a network that builds ocean literacy for (1) Hawaii's youth (K-16 students) and public, including Hawaii's substantial, year-round transient tourist population; (2) professionals working in ocean-related businesses; and (3) scientists engaged in ocean research. We will adapt and implement the COSEE CA COS and COSIA courses for our island setting. Broader Impacts: The training for these courses and the teaching of them will create relationships to bridge formal and informal education, research, traditional cultural practices, and public activities. During the three-year period, POLYPPS will help educators employ contextual, place-based ways to engage students in STEM courses. POLYPPS' long-range goal is to build a collaborative network that connects ocean research and teaching with traditional knowledge to facilitate active engagement in stewardship and policy by all ocean users. The main activities of POLYPPS will be: [1] Organize a training workshop in collaboration with COSEE CA staff that will train a cadre of professionals in Hawaii to teach the COS/COSIA courses;  [2] Organize both COS/COSIA as either credit or non-credit courses throughout the University of Hawaii System for: (a) graduate science students participating in GK-12 programs and other graduate students with an interest in education and for community college students in ocean sciences who may consider a career in education; (b) pre-service and in-service K-12 educators; (c) informal educators in non-profit organizations, aquaria, museums, and government educational agencies; and (d) ocean-related businesses, hotels, and tour operators; and [3] Develop new course components that will integrate Hawaii resources, including unique traditional cultural practices and ocean policies, current research on ecosystems of particular relevance to local and regional communities and exemplary curriculum materials."
10569,NSF,HHS,"While the sample survey is one of the cornerstones of social science research methods, the tool is experiencing large declines in participation of sampled persons. This project studies participation in cross-section Random-Digit Dialed (RDD) telephone surveys. The declines have led to such significant research cost increases that serious consideration of terminating basic surveys is occurring. One large source of variation in RDD cooperation rates is the interviewer. In centralized telephone interviewing facilities interviewers are often assigned similar mixes of cases, yet obtain very different response rates. All the stimuli yielding a decision to participate in an RDD survey must be delivered through audio channel ? through words, pitch, inflection, and pacing of the interviewers? speech. These attributes are not the traditional objects of study of survey methodologists. Hence, the project combines insights from speech science, phonetics, psycholinguistics, and survey methodology. A central conceptual framework utilizes the companion notions of tailoring, convergence, and similarity in cooperative dyadic communication. 5,000 digital audio recordings of RDD telephone interviewer introductions (from two data collection organizations, 6 different surveys, and 165 different interviewers) are transformed into a quantitative data set suitable for dynamic and static statistical models of response propensities. Acoustic measures motivated by concepts from speech science are extracted using Praat acoustic software; raters make judgments of perceived attributes of speakers using both concepts central to leverage-salience theory and the social psychology; and word and disfluency rates are extracted from transcriptions of the audio files. The resulting data set is a relational one with records at the levels of the interviewer, respondent (case), contact, and conversational turn. Hierarchical and survival models are built using the combined conceptual frameworks predicting the final participation decision of a sample case. While the research emphasizes basic science, it has potential practical outcomes. Academic survey research is a crucial tool for a $15 billion commercial research industry in the US; this project?s success can contribute to the health of this commercial sector."
10601,NSF,NSF,"Wayfinding is an essential capability for any person who wishes to have an independent life-style. It requires successful execution of several tasks including navigation and object and place recognition, all of which necessitate accurate assessment of the surrounding environment. For a visually-impaired person these tasks may be exceedingly difficult to accomplish and there are risks associated with failure in any of these. Guide dogs and white canes are widely used for the purpose of navigation and environment sensing, respectively. The former, however, has costly and often prohibitive training requirements, while the latter can only provide cues about obstacles in one?s surroundings. Human performance on visual information dependent tasks can be improved by sensing which provides information and environmental cues, such as position, orientation, local geometry, object description, via the use of appropriate sensors and sensor fusion algorithms. Most work on wayfinding aids has focused on outdoor environments and has led to the development of speech-enabled GPS-based navigation systems that provide information describing streets, addresses and points of interest. In contrast, the limited technology that is available for indoor navigation requires significant modification to the building infrastructure, whose high cost has prevented its wide use. This proposal adopts a multi-faceted approach for solving the indoor navigation problem for people with limited vision. It leverages expertise from robotics, computer vision, and blind spatial cognition with behavioral studies on interface design to guide the discovery of information requirements and optimal delivery methods for an indoor navigation system. Designing perception and navigation algorithms, implemented on miniature-size commercially-available hardware, while explicitly considering the spatial cognition capabilities of the visually impaired, will lead to the development of indoor navigation systems that will assist blind people in their wayfinding tasks while facilitating cognitive-map development."
10624,NSF,HHS,"To solve the most critical intellectual and social problems, teams need to be made up of the best possible people, linked to the best possible resources. While there is growing awareness of the socio-economic consequences of team collaborations, there is little socio-technical understanding of how teams are assembled or how a given mode of assembly impacts its effectiveness. This project seeks to address this limitation by developing a theoretical framework to understand the socio-technical dynamics shaping the assembly of teams in virtual communities. These multidimensional networks include a variety of links that exist not only among individuals, but also with documents, datasets, workflows, analytic tools, and concepts. With these new configurations in mind, this project addresses two main research questions: First, what are the socio-technical motivations that explain the assembly of teams in virtual communities? Second, to what extent do the assembly mechanisms of teams influence their effectiveness? Empirically testing such models poses formidable data collection challenges. However, this project has access to six major initiatives serving diverse scientific virtual communities including nanoscience, environmental engineering, earthquake engineering, chemical sciences, media research and tobacco research.Intellectual merit: This effort is uniquely positioned to usher a new generation of theories and methods focused on explaining an important precursor to all collaborations - the socio-technical assembly mechanisms used to generate effective teams in virtual communities. Methodologically, this project will significantly extend network analytic techniques for statistically modeling high-dimensionality multimodal networks. Broader impacts: The proposed research will have broad impacts on three stakeholder communities.  First, individual researchers, especially students and those not in elite institutions will learn strategies to assemble effective teams in virtual communities. Second, leaders of virtual communities will gain a dashboard to assess and steer strategies within their initiatives. Third, funding agencies will get new insights in assessing their portfolios and directing science policy."
10714,NSF,HHS,"Collaborative Research: Establishing the Flexibility and Physiology of Symbiodinium Symbioses in the Eastern Pacific: Predicting Ecological Success in Light of Future Climate ChangeMark E. WarnerUniversity of DelawareTodd C. LaJeunesseFlorida International UniversityPhotosynthetic symbionts that inhabit coral tissues in great abundance may become damaged during periods of severe thermal stress.  These situations lead to mass coral bleaching events often resulting in the mortality of numerous corals and subsequent degradation of the entire ecosystem they support.  The discovery that some corals can harbor different species of symbiont with differing thermal sensitivity has led to the hypothesis that such variability could provide an axis for acclimatization or adaptation to climate change if corals can host thermally tolerant algae. In particular, it is thought that zooxanthellae (algae in the genus Symbiodinium) within the  D  lineage may serve this role, yet knowledge of the ecological distribution and physiological detail of this and other groups of zooxanthellae is largely incomplete. The eastern Pacific provides an excellent venue to test ideas of symbiont change and resilience, as it encompasses regions that have been differentially impacted by bleaching and has coral species known to harbor D-type zooxanthellae.  Drs. Warner and LaJeunesse will investigate the distribution of different zooxanthellae within and between several populations of ecologically important reef-building corals in three regions of western Mexico with historical differences in bleaching frequency and severity.  Genetic surveys at multiple temporal and spatial scales will utilize new methods for algal detection to characterize the full complement of zooxanthellae within chosen corals.  The short and long-term impacts of thermal exposure on the photosynthetic activity and calcification of corals known to harbor multiple or single symbionts will be assessed, as will the potential for recovery from thermal stress via symbiont change. Lastly, fitness will be evaluated by investigating the growth and reproductive output of coral-algal combinations.  The outcome of this research should provide much needed knowledge toward the question of how (or if) zooxanthellae and reef corals can survive future environmental disturbance based on predicted increases in sea water temperature.  The proposed work represents a collaborative effort between U.S. and Mexican scientists and includes the training of two PhD students and several undergraduate students from the collaborating investigators' home institutions."
10748,NSF,NSF,"PIs: Aaron Packman (Northwestern University), Douglas Jerolmack (University of Pennsylvania), Jud Harvey (U.S. Geological Survey)Overview: Solute transport in rivers is a complex problem influenced by both hydrologic and geomorphic dynamics. It is important to be able to predict the interactions of hydrologic dynamics, geomorphic dynamics, and solute transport in order to improve assessment of long-term average biogeochemical processing rates in river systems. Stream-subsurface hydrologic interactions are modulated by surface morphology and strongly affect solute transport in both streams and pore waters, thereby controlling a very wide range of biogeochemical processes. Here we propose to obtain a unique new data set encompassing observations of both fluvial morphodynamics and solute transport in a sand-bed river subject to frequent high-flow and sediment-transport events. We also propose to develop new theory to allow scaling relationships previously observed in both geomorphology and surface-groundwater interactions to be incorporated into a model for long-term average solute transport in rivers. The model will be applied to the study site by incorporating observed statistics of stream flow variations and channel morphology, and will be tested using direct observations of both solute penetration into the subsurface and net downstream solute transport averaged over a range of time scales.Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this work lies in advancing fundamental understanding of the linkage between stream hydrology, fluvial morphodynamics, surface-groundwater interactions, and solute transport in rivers. This is an exceedingly complex problem as it involves not only turbulent flow-boundary interactions, but also sediment transport and pore fluid flow in the highly heterogeneous near-stream environment. Here we will synthesize numerous recent observations and hypotheses developed separately in hydrology and geomorphology in order to ascertain how the linkage between flow dynamics and morphodynamics in rivers controls solute transport over various spatial and temporal scales. While it is now generally recognized that such synthesis needs to be done in order to assess the behavior of environmental systems in an integrated fashion, such integration has rarely been achieved in practice. By developing new theory that takes advantage of commonality in geomorphic and hydrologic scaling relationships, we enable explicit evaluation of the integrated process that control solute transport dynamics over a variety of spatial and temporal scales in river corridors.Broader Impacts: The proposed effort will contribute very broadly to environmental science and the associated management of water resources and aquatic ecosystems. Further, through a variety of synergistic activities we will also realize numerous broader impacts in human resource development and in the scientific community at large. The project results will provide significant, necessary capability to evaluate the migration of a wide range of important solutes in river systems. There is a critical need for tools that can be used to predict the linkage of morphological variations (e.g., land-use changes) and long-term average transport behavior under variable hydrologic forcing (natural flow variability and alternative climate change scenarios). Therefore the project results can be expected to not only contribute detailed understanding of river dynamics, but also to have very broad impacts in supporting analysis of the migration and processing of carbon, nutrients, contaminants, and a range of other important substances in river systems. Essentially, the project efforts provide a critical step towards scientifically based sustainable management of freshwater resources. We will further enhance these general contributions by supporting the broader scientific community working on these problems. We will archive the unique field data set that we will acquire, and make it publicly available to other theoreticians and modelers to facilitate broader development and testing of models for flow and transport in river corridors. We will also facilitate scientific discourse, and particularly synthesis of scientific results to address policy and management questions, by convening multiple, directed interdisciplinary sessions at major technical conferences, and by translating project results directly into the broader Hydrologic Synthesis activity currently sponsored by NSF. Finally, we will realize broad contributions to human resource development by training numerous young investigators through this work, by engaging in synergistic and collaborative international activity, and by using project results to further our ongoing efforts to encourage pre-college students, and particularly students from under-represented minorities, to enter careers in science"
10752,NSF,NSF,"Intellectual Merit: Heme is the most abundant source of circulating iron in mammals.  It is therefore not surprising that many pathogenic bacteria, including the opportunistic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, avidly pursue its capture and internalization in order to overcome the very low free-iron concentrations encountered in their mammalian hosts.  To capture heme, several pathogenic bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, deploy a heme acquisition system (Has), which consists of a protein secreted to the extracellular space (HasAp) and an outer membrane receptor (HasR).  HasAp is also termed a hemophore because it efficiently captures hemoglobin-heme and delivers it to the receptor for subsequent internalization.  The project aims to achieve fundamental molecular level understanding of the protein-protein interactions that allow HasAp to  steal  heme from human hemoglobin.  In particular, the investigators seek to gain structural, dynamic and mechanistic insights into the factors that determine the transfer of heme from human hemoglobin to HasAp.  This long-range goal will be reached by pursuing three main objectives: 1) Elucidate the three dimensional structure of apo-HasAp, 2) Identify the binding interface of the encounter complex that forms when HasAp binds to hemoglobin, prior to heme transfer, and decipher the role played by the gross reorganization of HasAp structural elements in the molecular recognition and binding to hemoglobin, and 3) Characterize the changes in coordination and spin state experienced by the heme-iron in the early stages of heme transfer from hemoglobin to HasAp.  The Moënne-Loccoz and Rivera laboratories have joined forces to meet the interdisciplinary demands of the proposed activities.  The Rivera lab will conduct the NMR spectroscopic studies aimed at solving the structure of HasAp devoid of heme, map the interface of the complex and study the dynamical properties of HasAp in the encounter complex. The Moënne-Loccoz lab will carry out the rapid-mix-quench experiments coupled to UV-vis, EPR and resonance Raman necessary to delineate the fate of the hemoglobin-heme as it is captured by HasAp.  Broader Impacts: In addition to providing molecular insight into the manner by which P. aeruginosa captures heme from hemoglobin to overcome the low iron concentrations in a mammalian host, the fundamental knowledge derived from these investigations may pave the way for the future design of inhibitors to the interactions between hemoglobin and HasAp. The multidisciplinary nature of the project will provide opportunities for students at all academic levels.  Video-conference calls and yearly visits from the Moënne-Loccoz and Rivera labs will expose the students to the intellectually diverse atmosphere that is necessary to nurture multidisciplinary research.  The ethnically rich environment present in both groups will prepare students for the multifaceted work environment they are likely to encounter after graduation.  The collaborative spirit of this project will illustrate the benefits of a broad-based approach for (1) solving complex problems, (2) effectively interpreting results obtained in one laboratory within a global context; and thus (3) maximizing the impact on this research on the greater scientific community and the general public."

The goals of the workshop are as follows:a) To discuss the specific services and resources available to students with disabilities on each of the participating campuses and the use of these services and resources by students;b) To identify effective strategies used on the respective campuses to ensure that students with disabilities have access to all campus facilities as well as to instructional materials, tutorial assistance, and other resources, including assistive technologies to support their academic study;c) To identify barriers to providing needed services and support on the respective campuses and to discuss ways those barriers might be reduced/eliminated; andd) To review the latest program solicitation for NSF's Research in Disabilities Education (RDE) Program; review selected abstracts of currently active RDE-funded projects; hear presentations by RDE-funded project directors on effective strategies; and discuss the participating teams' preliminary ideas for potential RDE proposals.This project includes consultants who are knowledgeable about students with disabilities in post-secondary STEM education and who are experts in the area of services provided by post-secondary institutions for students with disabilities.  An independent evaluator will assess the outcomes and impacts of this project, and project dissemination will include diffusion of information via an accessible web-site that can be easily used by people with disabilities."
10763,NSF,NSF,"Traditional approaches to studying plant invasions have produced limited insights into the mechanisms underlying successful and widespread invasions. A wealth of reviews has indicated a need for biogeographically explicit experiments that consider a variety of biotic interactions, that include multiple populations of the invasive plant from its native and introduced range, and that utilize multiple plant species from each range to provide appropriate ecological context. This project will build on ongoing studies of the Chinese tallow tree, a species that is highly invasive in the southeast U.S., by simultaneously manipulating multiple biotic interactions in both invasive and native portions of the species' current geographic range. Field and greenhouse experiments in the US and China will be used to investigate the roles of aboveground (specialist and generalist herbivores, foliar fungi) and belowground (pathogenic fungi, mycorrhizae, herbivores) interactions in determining tallow tree success. The intellectual merit of this project is that it will enhance understanding of mechanisms that contribute to the success, or failure, of introduced species, and the relative importance of those mechanisms in native and new portions of the geographic range of an invasive species. The substantial and growing economic impact of invasive species contributes to the broader impact of this project; better understanding of mechanisms that contribute to the success of invasive species will help guide land and resource managers. Other broader impacts include training of graduate and undergraduate students, and a significant international collaboration with scientists at four Chinese institutions.This award is funded in part by the Office of International Science and Engineering."
10769,NSF,NSF,"Engineering Technology - (58) In 2002, Wayne State University (WSU) was awarded an NSF grant to develop an adaptation of the Learning Factory model that would be less costly to implement. That project focused on introducing the use of coordinated hands-on projects in standard laboratory settings across selected courses, using a model engine application as the unifying theme. This approach proved to be a more cost-effective way to give students hands-on experience in a range of issues involved in product realization. The goal of this CCLI phase II project is to distill a core of course-level learning outcomes from WSU's previous work and develop an approach for mapping these to higher program-level outcomes that help to meet industry-defined competency gaps of students.  This project takes the successful approach of using coordinated hands-on activities across multiple courses to provide students with specific competencies, and test its efficacy by implementing it simultaneously in five diverse departments at four different institutions. Students will learn by trying things out, and working with others in a holistic, systematic way."
10803,NSF,NSF,"Intelligent Merit: The intent of this proposal is to conduct a national, retrospective study of specialized science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) schools that provide a more rigorous course of study for academically talented, science-focused students.  The main goal of the proposed work is to determine what contributions can be made to public policy decisions about SMT education relative to specialized schools.  The study will examine the educational and career consequences of these schools to gain better insights about their contributions to the SMT workforce.Through a three-phased approach, this study will focus on graduates from specialized high schools and their counterparts from regular high schools as a comparison group.  During the first phase of the study, graduates from one specialized high school and from a comparison group will be studied, while during phase two, three specialized schools and comparison groups will be studied.  In phase three, the study will be expanded using the same study respondents from the first two phases.  Throughout the first two phases, methods and instruments will be crafted, piloted, and revised.  Overall, the study will involve 5000 graduates from specialized SMT schools and 1000 graduates with similar backgrounds from regular high schools.The research questions for this study include:1. Are graduates from specialized SMT high schools more likely to enroll in SMT-related studies and career fields when compared with graduates from regular non-magnet non-examination high schools with comparable academic and demographic backgrounds?2.  What school models employed by specialized SMT high schools are most associated with entrance into SMT-related studies and career fields? (School models include: residential schools, schools-within-schools, regional centers with half-day courses.)3. To what degree do graduates from specialized SMT high schools who pursue non-SMT degree concentrations and careers attribute value to the SMT skills and content they experienced at their high school?4. Do graduates from specialized SMT high schools differ in their professed understanding and personal interest regarding science-related public issues from graduates of regular non-magnet non-examination high schools with comparable academic and demographic backgrounds?Broader Impacts: The study will likely advance discovery and understanding about how schools should be structured to ensure academically talented students, including those historically underserved, reach their fullest potential. The results could inform policy about the value of SMT schools to the STEM workforce, hence, in that regard, it could e transformative.  Key partners (e.g. schools, universities, and corporations) have been assembled to provide broad-based support to specific aspects of this project.  The qualitative phase of the study will target the perspectives of graduates on factors (e.g. education, success, ethics), other than enrollment and achievement. The advisory board represents a variety of expertise and stakeholder communities and will likely yield a wider dissemination of results and findings."

The goal of this book, and its accompanying public-domain e-media, is to organize and present the most important knowledge about Earth's surface in a concise fashion relevant to the way in which todays students deal with information. This project addresses a dynamic discipline of the geosciences and serves as a  model for textbook creation in the STEM disciplines. The textbook is being designed, printed, and distributed by a commercial publisher and is linked to a public-domain website that hosts a suite of e-media, referred to as  Vignettes . These are short (<1000 word) case studies that supplement the text and allow customization of the learning environment. Some vignettes are place-based examples; some are quantitative treatments of significant equations or problems in geomorphology; and others feature videos or animations that clarify difficult concepts. The vignettes are being created by experts, vetted by others, linked to the textbook, searchable on line, and available free, both on line and as PDF versions. The  Shortbook  concept comes from the recommendations of a 2006 NSF/National Academy of Sciences workshop,  Reconsidering the Textbook , which suggested that textbooks of the future would be short, economical, reflect community consensus, be student-centered, and be well and purposefully integrated with e-media. This project is testing the workshop recommendations by creating a new textbook in the growing discipline of geomorphology for which the existing texts were first published between 12 and 30 years ago. The assessment plan, which is integral to this proposal and the textbook development process is designed to improve the quality of the final product and determine whether the project has met its goal of creating a book that is widely accepted and useful for both students and faculty."
10815,NSF,NSF,"Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) are integrated systems in which humans and natural components interact.  CHANS research recently has emerged as an exciting and integrative field of cross-disciplinary scientific inquiry, with research projects covering a variety of coupled systems in locations spanning the globe.  Until now, however, this type of research has largely been undertaken in the traditional mode of individual projects, each focused on one or a small number of sites.  Although these individual projects have generated many important insights, it is essential to systematically transform the field to be more than the sum of its parts and to provide broader insights of greater scientific and societal significance than those resulting from individual projects alone.  This project aims to foster that transformation by developing an international network of research on CHANS (CHANS-Net) to facilitate communication and collaboration among members of the CHANS research community (e.g., ecologists, social scientists, geoscientists, and engineers).  CHANS-Net has four interrelated objectives:  (1) To promote communication and collaboration across the CHANS community through virtual interaction; (2) To facilitate communication and collaboration through face-to-face interaction; (3) To generate and disseminate comparative and synthesis scholarship on CHANS complexity; and (4) To strengthen, broaden and diversify the CHANS community.  These objectives will be achieved through a series of activities, including the creation of a state-of-the-art web-based Virtual Resource Center to offer timely exchange and dissemination of important information, the organization of symposia and workshops to compare and synthesize the latest research findings and methods on CHANS complexity across various research sites, the publication of first-rate comparative and synthesis results on CHANS complexity, and the establishment of a CHANS Fellows program to enable the participation of students and junior researchers in CHANS-Net activities, with particular efforts to encourage the participation from underrepresented groups. The project will advance discovery and understanding of CHANS complexity by enhancing communication and collaboration across the CHANS community.  It will elevate CHANS science to a higher level of synthesis by taking advantage of the knowledge and strengths of the site-based CHANS research.  It will offer useful information for researchers in various fields and other people from around the world who are interested in CHANS.  It will further stimulate interest in CHANS research and increase the number and the effectiveness of scholars pursuing CHANS research.  In addition to the production of scholarly synthesis, this project will yield many other very important products, such as the identification of research gaps and priorities, improvement in methods for rigorous comparative analyses across site-based CHANS studies, training of a new generation of leaders in CHANS research, and building of professional relationships that will lead to longer, deeper, and broader collaboration in the future.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program."
10820,NSF,NSF,"The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate user interface tools that enable middle school students to effectively teach themselves the basics of computer programming using programs written by peers. The proposed tools will enable middle school users to 1) identify interesting functionality within programs written by peers and 2) re-create that functionality for use in their own programs through automatically generated custom tutorials. As users complete these tutorials to re-create functionality selected from programs their peers have written, they will be introduced to a broad range of programming concepts and constructs. The project will include user testing to both guide and evaluate the development of 1) user interface tools that enable novice programmers to find code of interest in an unfamiliar codebase and 2) technology to automatically generate customized tutorials based on a recorded history of the sequence of user interface actions used to construct a program.Computer programming has become a fundamental tool that enables progress  across a broad range of disciplines including basic science, communications, and medicine. Yet, Computer Science is failing to attract the number of students necessary to sustain progress both within the discipline and in those disciplines supported by computer science. Opportunities to study computer science during middle school (when many students begin to opt out of math and science based careers) are rare. This project will enable middle school children to teach themselves computer programming using programs created by their peers. The project will be implemented within Storytelling Alice, an environment that enables middle school children to write programs to create 3D animated movies. Users will be able to identify parts of movies created by other users that interest them and follow automatically generated tutorials to learn how to create the selected parts of those movies. By building tools that help users to learn effectively from programs written by peers within an appealing programming environment, we enable middle school students across the country to develop skills in computer programming at a time when formal opportunities to study computer science are decreasing and the need for computer scientists is increasing. While this project targets middle school students in the context of learning computer programming, there are many other audiences (e.g. adults learning a new piece of computer software) would benefit from software technologies that enable self-teaching."
10840,NSF,HHS,"This workshop is focused on exploring the feasibility of a Regional Native American Graduate Research Center.  The workshop will engage a diverse group of stakeholders in Native American education, training, and research from the Northwest region, and from the broader U.S.  Participants in this collaborative process will include leaders from Native American tribes and inter-tribal organizations in the Northwest, representatives from Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCU) across the western U.S., representatives from NSF-sponsored Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) and Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) projects, and administrators and faculty from the University of Idaho (UI) and other majority institutions in the western U.S. that have strong Native American programs.The workshop will explore creative, original, and potentially transformative concepts that could, in the long term, become a model for Native American graduate education, improving STEM degree attainment and strengthening the workforce.  A goal of the workshop is to create a consensus vision for a magnet center for Native American graduate students to engage in research relevant to their cultural backgrounds and interests.  Such an interdisciplinary center would feature research opportunities in natural resources, health, education, law and policy, and economics.  On the education side, such a center would develop holistic curricula that reflect the integrated world view of Native Americans, such as forest science in the context of ecosystems, with relation to tribal health, lifestyle, law and policy.Workshop topics will include discussion on the needs of each tribe represented; discussion with the TCUs represented on what has been successful with graduating their students in STEM fields, and discussion on best practices for transitioning baccalaureate STEM graduates into graduate degree programs; discussion on research opportunities, their relevance to tribal needs, and identification of natural partners; presentation by Native American graduate students from various institutions on what has and has not worked, and what a center could do for them and their successors; a culture discussion on how a center could transform the experience of Native American graduate students; an education discussion on integration within existing curricula and new curricula; and discussion on follow-on activities, including exploration into sources of funding for a center.  Discussions will be led by a facilitator, and the workshop will include an evaluation component.  A final report will assimilate information from the workshop and follow-on activities, and is expected to include an initial roadmap for a center and identification of potential funding sources."
10859,NSF,NSF,"Macaulay2 is a free computer algebra system dedicated to the qualitative     investigation of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  It     was developed by Daniel Grayson and Michael Stillman with NSF funding.     Grayson and Stillman will continue the development of Macaulay2.  They     will upgrade existing algorithms, develop and publish new algorithms, and     implement new algorithms. In particular, they will develop the interaction     of the symbolic computations that are Macaulay2's strength with the new     floating point algorithms in algebraic geometry that are now being     developed by Andrew Sommese, Jan Verschelde, Anton Leykin, Frank Schreyer     and others.  It is anticipated that these will make a whole new class of     problems accessible to experimentation and, in many cases, solution.     Eisenbud will organize contacts for the extended integration with other     systems and will engage other mathematicians in the development work that     needs to be done.  Central to the project are the continued expansion of     the collaborations that have been the hallmark of Macaulay2 development.     For this purpose two Macaulay2 Workgroup Meetings will be held in the     course of the two-year grant.  One particular research problem to be     attacked is: the use of computational systems to (probabilistically)     disprove, or suggest a proof of, the Jacobian Conjecture on polynomial     automorphisms of affine spaces (this will require the use the new floating     point algorithms).  Other areas where new algorithms can make an impact     include the study of numerical systems, fractions with specified types of     denominators, ideal factorization, systems where the multiplication of the     variables doesn't satisfy the commutative law, geometric optimization, the     analysis of observations of gene expression levels over time, and     bioinformatics.     Macaulay2 is part of the infrastructure that supports mathematical     research involving systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  The     study of such systems of polynomial equations is central in pure and     applied mathematics and in physics, with recent new impacts in such fields     as cryptography, robotics and string theory.  Increasing computer power     and the availability of programs like Macaulay2 are making a new level of     experimentation possible.  The experimental results found with Macaulay2     are helping in the formulation and development of tractable conjectures in     mathematics as well as in physics. A measure of Macaulay2's impact is that     at least 270 research papers have cited Macaulay2, several mathematicians     have contributed code, and books and course materials are now using it.     The PI's will develop the software further and will recruit developers     from the research community.  They will introduce graduate students and     mathematicians to the use of computers in research mathematics and the     requisite skills in programming and development of algorithms, through     workgroups at Berkeley and through the appointments of graduate students     as graduate assistants."
10862,NSF,HHS,"PI name: Kevin LanseyInstitution: University of ArizonaProposal Number: 0835930This award is an outcome of the competition as part of the Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (NSF 07-579) solicitation under the subtopic Resilient and Sustainable Infrastructures (RESIN).  The proposed project will advance engineering and scientific understanding and will develop new methods for integrated water and wastewater infrastructure planning. Over the next four years, the project aims to identify, design and evaluate water supply/wastewater treatment system configuration alternatives in the presence of complex, competing objectives and uncertainty. Each configuration will include all major conveyance facilities (pumps and pipes), storage, and treatment facilities for water and wastewater. Alternative facilities plans will be evaluated based on the triple bottom lines consisting of: (i) economic, (ii) environmental, and (iii) social values. The major intellectual innovation is the proposed approach to optimize a sustainability objective function that embodies the triple bottom line with components representing capital, operation, and maintenance costs; greenhouse emissions and depletion of ecosystem water allocations; social and institutional defined limits on water reuse and decentralized wastewater treatment; and risk as penalties arising from failure to meet system sustainability and resilience objectives. In addition to the innovations in the encompassing effort, novel approaches will be developed for dual water distribution system planning and design and new computational algorithms will be developed to optimize the resulting models. Frameworks for assessing social and institutional preferences, in the short-term for existing infrastructure and reuse options and in the long-term as co-evolving with conjunctive systems will be established.Multiple factors combine to increase the complexity and urgency of water/wastewater facilities planning, as addressed by this project: (i) water scarcity and the need for efficient and sustainable use of every available water resource; (ii) increased population and thus, increased demand for water; (iii) general deterioration of water supply and sanitary infrastructures that are reaching the end of their lifecycles; (iv) heightened public awareness of the quality of water consumed; (iv) interdependence of water supply goals and other, sometimes competing objectives such as in-stream uses for reclaimed water and minimization of greenhouse gas emissions. These factors necessitate an urgent consideration of infrastructure system sustainability and resilience in the presence of supply and demand uncertainties. In short, water supply based solely on engineering judgment must be transformed to operate in an increasingly complex planning landscape.  Moreover, the proposed research directly addresses the recently identified  National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenge  of restoring and improving urban infrastructure and wastewater systems. The systems analytical tool will generate impact, not only in the southern Arizona growth corridor but also nationally as a result of its generic approach. It will allow planners to objectively approach decisions regarding sustainable water/wastewater systems integration, degree of decentralization of new wastewater treatment facilities, timing and scale of new facility addition, and (where system extension is contemplated) apportionment of costs among existing and proposed facilities. The application of the tools to real systems and generating guidance for the applicability of decentralized dual water supply system will lead to the much broader impact of altering the present water supply paradigm that treats wastewater as a disposal issue rather than a resource. Our approach considers an integrated water and wastewater infrastructure system that is advantageous in meeting expanding water demands while accumulating the benefits of lower energy consumption and cost, a reduced carbon footprint, and better overall water quality. The project also has significant public awareness and education activities on water reuse at many levels, including key institutions (e.g., regional players such as Tucson Water) and K-12 education. Workshops will be held at AWWARF and WERF meetings. Innovations from the work will be published in peer-reviewed journals, disseminated to practitioners, and incorporated into engineering and public policy curriculum. Efforts will be made to expand the role of under-represented groups in this area through project participation."
10980,NSF,HHS,"Technology is advancing rapidly in such areas as genomics, bioinformatics, and imaging, but not all species of plants and animals that are currently being studied for important biological questions can be used with the latest technology. This workshop will explore the need and importance of developing tools for new or emerging model systems that will enable scientists to address specific questions appropriate for understanding the complexity of life. This workshop will facilitate the achievement of this goal by identifying the  toolmakers  in the scientific community and the resources needed to develop important tools for a broad range of species that are best-suited for studying biological systems in a modern, integrative manner. At a broader level, this workshop will bring together researchers from many different disciplines to discuss what kinds of new tools and resources are needed. These discussions will result in the formulation of a broad and coherent set of goals to advance many different fields of biology. This workshop will include a great diversity of scientists in terms of their rank, areas of expertise, and institutional types and locations. In addition, scientists from groups underrepresented in Biology will be represented at the workshop."
10995,NSF,HHS,"Engineering Other - (59)With the rate of technological change growing rapidly and technological systems becoming increasingly complex, engineers capable of designing adaptable systems from both a systems level and a component level are needed for the US to remain competitive. Addressing this problem requires a transformative change in engineering education. Thus, a long-term goal of this project is to make this transformation a reality across the nation. Short-term goals of the project include the development of Technology Leaders, a transportable interdisciplinary program that will prepare engineers and technicians to lead geographically-distributed teams in the designing and building of multiscale agile systems.  Building on prior work at the University of Virginia, Central Virginia Community College, and the Learning Factory at Penn State, the Technology Leaders program will integrate three elements: a new interdisciplinary, design-focused undergraduate curriculum; the hands-on Multiscale Agile Systems Technology Lab (MAST Lab); and applied summer educational experiences for students."
10996,NSF,NSF,"This project capitalizes on a recently introduced revision of the University of Washington's teacher preparation program,  Teachers for  New Era , and is benefiting from existing collaborations among science and mathematics departments in the Colleges of Arts and Sciences and of Education, and three of the largest school districts in Washington: Seattle, Highline, and Renton. Thirty-six scholarships are being awarded, 9 each year over 4 years, balanced between mathematics and science majors. The maximum amount of yearly scholarship support is $15,000, to cover tuition and stipends for four quarters of full-time graduate study leading to certification at the secondary level for either mathematics or science. Participants may continue for an additional quarter to receive a Master's in Teaching degree. The program offers one year of subject-specific induction following graduation.Intellectual Merit: The Noyce Scholars Program is serving as a national model for attracting, preparing, and retaining outstanding STEM major as teachers in high-needs schools. The program benefits from years of intensive and broad based data collection about the education, support, and retention of teachers. The extended support for the Noyce Scholars after graduation is designed to offer a set of induction experiences that helps ensure that these teachers remain in the profession, refine their practices, and foster high levels of achievement in a cadre of young students over time. Broader Impact: The four cohorts of secondary science and mathematics teachers trained by this project will be placed in high-needs schools giving students from largely underrepresented groups access to excellent instruction. Because of the continued involvement of faculty in collecting data on the effectiveness of a range of features of teacher training (e.g., selection of candidates, methods of instruction, analysis of pupil data, induction support) this project is contributing substantially to what is known about the design of preparation experiences and induction experiences. Insights gleaned from this project are being shared with colleges of education across the nation. Models for preparation and induction support are being widely disseminated across a spectrum of national audiences, educators, researchers, and policymakers."
11019,NSF,NSF,"Delayed benefits are usually valued less than immediate ones, for several reasons. Such a reduction in value can be viewed as the result of applying a temporal discount factor. There have been many studies of the observed discounting of future receipts of money. For example, if a decision maker judges that $100, to be received in 2 years, is equal in value to $70 right now, the observed discount rate for this decision is about 30% for 2 years (or about 16% per year). However, people also pursue goals other than money, including good health, safety, leisure, belonging, status, well being of others, and a stable and attractive environment. Such non-monetary goals may also be valued less if their achievement is delayed, so the concept of a temporal discount factor can be extended to these other goals. Different discount factors may apply for different goal categories, and this, in turn, would affect how people make tradeoffs among goals attained at different points in time. For example, if a decision maker judges an environmental improvement 2 years hence to be almost as valuable as the same improvement achieved now, the discount rate might be only 3% per year for the environmental goal even though it is 16% per year for a monetary gain of $100. A person who is unwilling to give up $100 now, for immediate attainment of the environmental goal, might be willing to make a binding commitment to give up $100 with a delay of one year (worth only $84), in order to achieve the same environmental goal with a delay of 1 year. Thus, it is important to know how human temporal discounting varies across goal categories in order to analyze the long-term benefits of public policies relating to health, safety, and environment.Our previous research showed the importance of affiliation and social goals (such as status or adherence to group norms) for decisions concerning environmental goals. Our new research will determine the best ways of measuring temporal discount factors for different goal categories, and will then quantitatively compare discount rates for a variety of economic, social and environmental goals. We focus both on typical responses and on individual and cultural variation. The research will advance the theory of decision making in social and group contexts (temporal discounting of social goals has not previously been considered), will develop methods for assessing temporal discount factors, and will lead to better analysis of public policy costs and benefits. For example, we will assess discount rates for some costs and benefits of measures to prevent global warming, using a diverse national sample, to inform policy on this critical issue. A field study will test applicability of our findings in an international population and will provide data on effective means of encouraging energy conservation."
11090,NSF,NSF,"The continent of Africa faces numerous socio-economic and public health challenges, including newly emerging or rapidly changing diseases; quickly changing ecological systems resulting from climate change; exploitation of natural resources; the need or desire to conserve disappearing ecosystems and wildlife; the challenge of resource management in the context of limited resources; changing agricultural practices and their impact on human health; and the effect of health events and changing climate and ecology on social structures, economic systems, and political stability.  Research and training in biomathematics can lead to substantial inroads in addressing these challenges. Addressing them is of importance not only to Africa but also to the rest of the world, including the US. The problems of Africa present particularly exciting and complex challenges for mathematical scientists, ranging from issues of mathematical modeling to issues of data analysis and interpretation. To allow US scientists to best help tackle these challenges, which range from issues of mathematical modeling to issues of data analysis and interpretation, partnerships are needed between US and African mathematical scientists so that US scientists can get first-hand understanding of the problems of Africa and the data they need for their models. Many of these challenges fall at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences. Dealing with these challenges requires a large number of researchers working on and trained in biomathematics and prepared to deal with specific biomath challenges arising from problems of Africa. Thus, it is important to enhance development of biomathematics and to train US mathematical scientists to work in biomathematics and in international venues with international collaborations.  The project features three US-Africa research workshops in Africa, focusing on challenges arising from Africa whose solution requires serious mathematical components:  (1) conservation biology and creation of ecological reserves and related issues of risk of extinction and risk of invasive species; (2) economic aspects of epidemiology;  and (3) the use of genetics to control diseases of humans and crops. The first two workshops will be preceded by an Advanced Study Institute (ASI), aimed at preparing graduate students to participate in the workshop, in follow-up research projects, and in long-term international collaborations. Small research projects catalyzed by the ASIs and workshops will involve US and African participants.  Because successful model development should never be divorced from data but sometimes is, a biomath modeling clinic with a data analysis emphasis is planned. Because it is important to train some African students in more depth than is possible in the planned ASIs, the project will host African graduate students for year-long visits, in the process exposing US graduate student and postdoctoral biomathematicians to the problems of Africa in a longer, more extended mode than is possible with a two-week activity.  African faculty will also come as visitors to engage in joint research projects. Materials arising from the ASIs and workshops will be widely disseminated through books, articles, websites, CDs, and reports, so others can copy these activities. Project results will be used in a separately-funded program that brings current research into the undergraduate classroom. International partnerships with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), the South African Centre of Excellence for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), the African Mathematical Institutes Network (AMI-Net), the African Mathematics Millennium Science Initiative (AMMSI), and the Canadian Network of Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS) will enhance the program.This project is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities."
11110,NSF,HHS,"Chemistry (12)This project creates and implements workshops for chemistry graduate students and postdoctoral associates in which the participants are introduced to Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) and the supporting research knowledge base. The workshops are developed and conducted by the PI, who is a current member of the POGIL Project steering committee and an experienced POGIL instructor and workshop facilitator. He is assisted by an experienced member of the POGIL network, and by a graduate student with experience in working with first-year college students. None of the current POGIL projects target graduate students or postdoctoral associates.  While POGIL is used as an organizing pedagogic structure, the workshops also discuss other curriculum models such as inquiry-based instruction in general, Peer Led Team Learning, and the use of technology such as  clickers  and tablet PCs.  The workshops are hosted at three research-intensive chemistry departments and include up to 35 participants, including interested faculty.  Host departments are ones that have not already provided similar opportunities for their students.  Workshop participants are learning POGIL by doing POGIL from the moment the workshop starts. They explore the model, its rationale, and student outcome data; they explore extant POGIL materials used in college chemistry instruction; they investigate a rubric-based process for assessing the strength of POGIL materials; and they consider implementation in different classroom settings. Through the POGIL project network and website, maintained at Franklin & Marshall College, participants have a means for staying connected and for increasing their involvement. The workshops are marketed to PhD students and postdoctoral associates in chemistry, particularly those who intend to seek academic positions. The intellectual merit of this project is that it brings chemistry graduate students and postdoctoral associates to a consideration of how the cognitive and social sciences can inform chemistry pedagogy. This is a scholarly approach to instruction which encourages potential future faculty to assume a similar approach in their own teaching. Information is being obtained through evaluation regarding the knowledge and skills needed by future faculty, barriers to their professional development, and their perspectives on the opportunities for becoming active members of a curriculum network at an early stage of their careers. The broader impact of this project is that the workshops are available to any graduate student or postdoctoral associate at the selected institutions.  The workshops enrich the knowledge and experiences of those students, and link them to the POGIL project through its database. The workshops increase the number of future faculty who are poised to engage in research-based college instruction, and ultimately should promote stronger student learning outcomes. As new faculty members, these participants will be a resource for their departmental colleagues regarding inquiry-based learning.  The evaluation is collecting information about whether these workshops plant seeds for future investments in this kind of professional development within the host departments."
11129,NSF,HHS,"This proposed four-year effort envisions a new approach to promoting science literacy through science journalism as a subject of study. It is premised on a critical set of assumptions: (a) Most citizens have the need to interpret scientific information found in popular media (e.g., newspapers, magazines, online resources, science-related television programs); (b) science journalism provides reliable, well-researched science information; (c) authentic science writing provides motivation to learn; and (d) standards and rubrics specifically developed for evaluating students' science-related expository text do not exist. Thus, the project approaches science journalism as a means to assist students to investigate and coherently write about contemporary science and to learn to base assertions and descriptions on reliable, publicly available sources. To this end, the project aims to develop, pilot, and evaluate a model of instruction that focuses on the following aspects: (a) Identifying questions of both personal and public interest; (b) evaluating contemporary science-related issues; (c) making available highly regarded sources of information as exemplars (in-print, online, interviews); (d) synthesizing information; (e) assessing information based on fact-checking using the five Ws (who, what, where, when, and why); and (f) coherently explaining claims and evidence. A hypothesis and a set of research questions guide this effort. The hypothesis is the following: If participating students successfully attain the fundamental elements of the proposed model, then they will become more literate and better critical consumers and producers of scientific information. The main guiding research question of the proposed activity is the following: Does the teaching of science journalism using an apprenticeship model, reliable data sources, and science-specific writing standards improve high school students' understanding of science-related public literacy? Secondary questions include (a) Is the teaching of science journalism an efficacious, replicable and sustainable model for improving science literacy?; (b) How useful are science-related standards and rubrics for scaffolding and evaluating students' science writing and science literacy?; and (c) What is the nature of the engagement in science that this apprenticeship invites?"
11149,NSF,HHS,"This project will study ophiolites (fragments of oceanic lithosphere) in the South Eastern Desert of Egypt and use this information to better understand economically significant mineral deposits. Previous efforts have shown that application of the fore-arc ophiolite mode to be very useful for understanding the ophiolitic assemblages in the Central Eastern Desert, and the PIs propose to similarly study ophiolitic rocks in the southern Eastern Desert. Emphasis will be placed on understanding ophiolites associated with the best defined suture zone in Egypt, the Allaqi-Heiani-Gerf suture, which can be continuously traced from Lake Nasser to the Red Sea just north of the Sudanese border. The Broader impacts include societal relevance since the scientific objective supports an economic objective of understanding what if any controls the ophiolite exerted on the type and location of economic mineral deposits.  Additionally there will be a diverse scientific benefit to the broader MARGINS community.This project is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering."
11150,NSF,HHS,"The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Brandeis University supports innovative research and education in an exciting subject at the interface between materials science and biology. The major research theme of the Center is to develop fundamental understanding of emergent properties of materials due to constraints similar to those occurring in biological systems, and in understanding the role of constraints in the structure and function of cells and cellular components. This is an interdisciplinary Center with twelve senior investigators from four departments at Brandeis University, and one each from Brown University and Olin College of Engineering. The MRSEC provides a multidisciplinary education for students in physics, chemistry and biology, that will contribute to the workforce at the research frontiers and to the needs of emerging biomaterials industries. Other educational programs include research experiences for undergraduates, and pre-college outreach through teacher training. The MRSEC offers a program targeted to inner-city minority science undergraduates at Brandeis. Scientists at the Center work with the Discovery Museums in Acton, MA, to develop interactive exhibits in the area of biological physics and materials science. The Center provides novel facilities for research in the emerging area of microfluidics and is collaborating with industry to develop microfluidics technologies. Research at the Center is organized as a single Interdisciplinary Research Group with three main thrusts that explore how the addition of constraints typically found in biology - confinement, crowding, and local forces that compete with and sometimes frustrate long range order - leads to emergent properties, in the realms of both structure and dynamics.   The research thrusts are structure and dynamics of long polymer molecules, such as DNA, in tightly confined volumes; self-assembly of  chiral  or twisted molecules that lead to unusual structures; and  active matter  composed of organized assemblies of self-powered particles that move in space or oscillate in time."
11166,NSF,NSF,"Intellectual Merit: This proposal addresses a topic of national interest about the effects of revising high school graduation credit requirements in mathematics and science.  The aim is to provide policymakers with information about how mathematics and science courses are adjusted at the district and school level following policy mandates.  The proposal will also address policy as it applies to graduation requirements for students historically underserved in STEM fields.  It will also provide insights about conflicting research relative to the effect of these policy revisions on school funding, shortages of mathematics and science teachers, special students populations, dropouts, and career-technical education.  Research questions will include:(1) While all states are seeking generally more study of mathematics and science and better student achievement, what more specific purposes do states have in legislating revised graduation requirements for mathematics and science (if any)?(2) In district responses to policy changes, what is the range of implementation plans with respect to funding, mathematics and science courses offerings, staffing, addressing impacts on various student populations, etc?(3) How do implementation plans and their effects vary with the types of policy, i.e. unit-based versus content-based requirements, and the range of different content-based requirements?(4) How well does actual implementation at the school level conform to the intended policy outcomes with respect to key aspects like course offering and content, and student? course taking and achievement?This proposer will analyze and synthesize data about these questions along four constructs: (1) empirical and descriptive studies published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) research published via other venues including online; (3) published expert knowledge and advice located in periodicals or on websites; and (4) current practice-based knowledge acquired through online experts.  The synthesis methods will allow the proposer to systematically and intensively evaluate the methodological integrity and evidentiary utility of each research construct.Broader Impacts: This proposal will advance knowledge in the field by becoming the first synthesis study of the impact of increased policy changes on the number of mathematics and science credits required for graduation in high schools across the nation.  Therefore, this study could be transformative relative to how policy changes impact STEM education and will add significantly to the limited studies about this topic.  An advisory board with strong representation in STEM education, the arts and sciences, and research and evaluation will assist with implementation.  In addition to traditional pathways, dissemination will be augmented by other outlets such as R& D Alerts newsletters to policymakers, coverage in Education week, and through collaboration with the National Commission on Teaching and America?s Future that has agreed to include the results of the study in the Weekly News Digest, an e-bulletin to thousand of policymakers and education leaders."

The approach is to develop a theoretical foundation of interaction of nuclear particles with fluids in metastable states. Prototype device designs will be fabricated and assessed experimentally versus state-of-the-art systems for sensitivity and selectivity for neutron vs. gamma vs. alpha vs. fission product detection. Qualification of operation under American National Standards Institute standard test environments will be performed.The main intellectual merit of this project will be a transformation in highly enriched uranium and other special nuclear materials detection methods by paving the way to novel, low cost, compact to large, high efficiency, readily adaptable and portable detectors. Scientific merit will be attained through the advancement of the fundamental understanding of tensioned fluids and detection techniques.Addressing the broader impact, the diverse research group includes two major university systems, a Historically Black Colleges and Universities institution and an inner city high school. The project will provide training and educational experiences to students from high school to PhD. Benefits to the society include progress in addressing the problem of nuclear threat detection and strengthened partnerships for teaching and research. The new knowledge and equipment will be employed in academic courses. As allowable, research results will be disseminated through journal and conference papers and student presentations ."
11175,NSF,NSF,"e propose to hold a symposium on memristor and memristive systems in fall 2008 by inviting experts to discuss scientific principles, experimental findings, and potential exploration of related topics. The importance of this field initially pioneered by Leon O. Chua in 1971 and by Leon Chua and Sung-Mo Kang in 1976 was reaffirmed recently by unveiling of a two-terminal nanoscale device presented in Nature by Stanley Williams and his collaborators at HP Labs.Potential development of more compact low power memory chips and realization of neuromorphic computing hardware among other possibilities has been suggested by the most recent experimental results. This workshop will potentially help accelerate significant progresses in this newly emerging field."
11203,NSF,NSF,"Intellectual Merit: A major challenge in Nanoscience is the design of synthetic molecular devices that run autonomously (that is, without externally mediated changes per work-cycle) and are programmable (modi&#64257;able behavior without full redesign). DNA-based synthetic molecular devices have advantages of simplicity of design and engineering, due to predictable secondary structure and well-established biochemistry. Tasks: The main Task is optimized design and experimental demonstration of molecular devices composed of DNA strands and DNAzyme. with unique advantages of being autonomous and programmable, requiring no protein enzymes. The experiments will be executed in carefully stages of increasing complexity. First to be demonstrated is a limited ability computational device, termed a DNAzyme calculator. Next to be demonstrated is a &#64257;nite state automata device, DNAzyme FSA, which executes &#64257;nite state transitions using DNAzymes. Further demonstrations will be extensions to probabilistic automata and non-deterministic automata. The keystone demonstration is a DNAzyme doctor device giving transduction of nucleic acid expression: programmed to respond to under-expression or over-expression of certain nucleic acid strands that may indicate a disease, and providing a response release of appropriate strands that can act as a drug remedy. Secondary Tasks are computer software for optimized design/simulation using realistic stochastic models and correlated to laboratory tests. Broader Impact: The development of autonomous and programmable molecular devices has a vast number of critical applications in the assembly and control of molecular scale devices. Although this work will be limited to the test tube to demonstrate fundamental capabilities, the impact of a DNAzyme doctor operating in vivo could be enormous in medicine. Important educational impact of the proposed research includes the highly interdisciplinary training of graduate students and postdocs."
11272,NSF,NSF,"The objective of this research is to develop the theory and advanced computational tools for a modular decomposition and analysis of complex gene networks.  The key challenge to overcome is that biological networks are high-dimensional coupled stochastic nonlinear systems with uncertain components.  The approach is to employ tools and expertise from computational and experimental systems biology, stochastic dynamic nonlinear networks, and control theory to systematically decompose the network into simple modules whose dynamic properties can be understood in isolation and then related to the behavior of the network.The research has the potential to provide a framework that (a) enables the decomposition of complex biological networks into modules; (b) identifies the essential characteristics of each module necessary to account for its role in the network's behavior; and (c) provides the analytical and computational foundation for the analysis and synthetic construction of networks of modules.  The systematic approach explicitly accounts for network dynamics, the stochastic nature, and uncertainty of biological networks.  Development of the framework is guided by and validated through carefully selected biological experiments.The research has the potential to provide new tools to help scientists reverse-engineer complex biological networks, leading to a deeper understanding of biological function.  Such understanding is a key step in the rational design of therapies.  Research and educational activities are tightly integrated to train a diverse cadre of scientists and engineers who are adept at employing computational thinking in multi-disciplinary research.  Recruitment of women and students from under-represented groups through summer internships, campus programs, and special institutional partnerships is central to the investigators' strategy for achieving diversity."
11281,NSF,HHS,"Each year, about one fifth of all of the carbon dioxide that is emitted to the atmosphere through human activities around the world comes from the clearing and burning of moist tropical forests.  During years of severe drought, large areas of forest catch fire, doubling these emissions.  Once burned, forests are more likely to burn again in a vicious cycle of forest degradation that further increases carbon emissions to the atmosphere as it damages rainforests.  This research will shed light on the processes that determine the response of forests to fire, and the likelihood of large-scale  savannization  of the Amazon - the transformation of rainforest into fire-prone brush vegetation.   It will achieve this through field experiments and measurements of burned forests that determine the effects of Amazon forest fire on subsequent invasion by flammable weeds and tree death - two factors that strongly influence the risk of further burning.  The data obtained will be used to modify a vegetation model of the Amazon that will be used to predict the likelihood of large-scale savannization and its potential contribution of carbon to the atmosphere.  Currently, models that predict the future of tropical forests in a warming world do not include fire, weed invasion, and land use.This research will fill an important gap in knowledge of how tropical forests in the Amazon will respond to climate change and growing economic pressures on tropical forests.  This project also will support international education student exchanges and public-outreach activities aimed at environmental literacy."
11306,NSF,NSF,"The self- and directed- assembly of colloidal (nano- to micro- scale) particles into structures within materials and devices is an emerging paradigm with wide-ranging technological impact.  However, the ability to create a target structure with an acceptably small level of defects is still lacking; systems too easily become dynamically arrested in undesired disordered, or defect-rich, states.  Our research will synergistically combine recent advances in digital microscopic imaging techniques and free energy calculation methods to address this problem.  Emerging microscopic imaging tools, including techniques such as confocal and total internal reflectance, provide unprecedented high-resolution, real-time, three-dimensional visualizations of colloidal assembly processes.  The key is to mine the tremendous amount of digital data produced in these experiments to identify successful pathways to particle assembly.  Theoreticians have traditionally approached such problems using the energy landscape (EL) paradigm, wherein one maps data from the high-dimensional configuration space (of order N, the number of particles in the system) to an EL in a low-dimensional set of key descriptors. This EL is the quantity of direct relevance to engineering of the process of interest; it contains the information (peaks, valleys, saddles) to quantify the equilibrium states and transition rates between them.  In this research we will (1) develop a close coupling methodology between digital optical microscopy experiments and particle-based simulation to compare measured and predicted ELs, and (2) use the resulting ELs to engineer (design, control, optimize) two applications: the self-assembly of photonic crystals and operation of electronic nanowire devices.Particles with sizes on the order of nanometers to micrometers immersed in fluid, commonly called colloids, can serve as the building blocks of interesting new products.  Examples include photonic band gap materials (e.g. for computers that operate with light instead of electrons) and dynamically reconfigurable nanowires (e.g. for tunable RF devices).  Under certain conditions the colloidal particles will spontaneously assemble into such useful materials, or they can be induced to do so through the application of external stimuli such as electric fields or temperature gradients.  However, the pathways to creating desired structures with acceptably low levels of defects are not well understood.  This research employs a combination of modern digital imaging techniques and theoretical tools from the field of statistical mechanics to measure, quantify, and control the assembly process.  We will develop knowledge of engineered pathways to low-defect structured particulate materials that can be systematically implemented in the manufacturing processes of the future.  Furthermore, we will use the rich visual data generated in experiments (e.g. images, videos), simulations (e.g. renderings, animations), and analyses (e.g. dynamic, multi-dimensional plots) to provide intuitive educational experiences for students at all levels (K-postgraduate) and in outreach programs to the general public."
11317,NSF,HHS,"With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering, Professors Laren Tolbert and Clifford Henderson at the Georgia Institute of Technology will work with collaborators Professors Klaus Mullen and Andreas Hirsch at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research and the University of Erlangen, respectively, on the synthesis and characterization of graphene nanoribbons. Graphene, a two-dimensional planar allotrope of carbon, has attracted considerable excitement as an electronic material beyond conventional silicon and compound semiconductors. A new bottoms-up oligomer approach to the synthesis of graphene ribbons on solid surfaces is proposed, free of structural defects, based upon oxidative aryl-aryl coupling reactions and Diels-Alder chemistry. Graphene nanostructures will be created directly through a novel  hot-tip nanolithography  technique, which uses a resistive heater within the atomic probe tip to locally convert graphene precursors into functional nanostructures on a surface. This technique will take advantage of the tremendous success and extensive literature in synthesizing free-standing graphitic molecules by a number of groups, including the collaborators on this project, as well as the exciting new hot-tip nanolithography methods pioneered by Professor Henderson and his collaborators.This proposal will use the unique but complementary capabilities of the group of four international investigators, each of whom supplies a critical piece of overall technology, to bring to bear the power of systematic organic synthesis. This potential breakthrough technology may open up a new and potentially transformative approach to nanocircuit design and strengthen the ties among several heretofore unlinked groups. The international collaboration will provide a unique educational experience for Ph.D. students and create a new interactive consortium. Moreover, Georgia Tech is one of the leading producers of graduates in science and engineering from underrepresented groups, and the groups of Henderson and Tolbert have an extensive record in the education of these students. Such groups will be targeted in soliciting candidates for participation in this project."
11322,NSF,HHS,"The focus of this project is on providing a molecular level understanding of photochemical reactions occurring inside secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles.  SOA contributes to both direct and indirect radiative forcing of climate, and affects air quality in the urban and remote atmosphere.  The primary goal of this research is to understand the photochemical processing of SOA derived from the oxidation of isoprene and selected monoterpenes by ozone or the nitrate radical (NO3).  To achieve this goal, model SOA will be prepared and the absorption spectra and photodissociation spectra of the resulting SOA material will be investigated using the method of aerosol photodissociation spectroscopy.  In parallel, the composition of model terpene SOA will be analyzed in detail using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry before and after the SOA is exposed to simulated solar radiation.  In addition, absolute quantum yields for photolysis of several model carbonyls embedded in SOA-like materials will be measured.  This information will be used to estimate rates of photochemical reactions occurring inside atmospheric SOA particles.The interaction between solar radiation and organic materials is directly relevant to several areas of research, including the photodegradation of organic polymers and coatings, photochemistry of soil organics and dissolved organic matter, organic photochemistry, and water purification.  This research will also provide information useful for predicting the health effects of aged organic particulate matter.  Two graduate students will be supported through this award."
11358,NSF,NSF,"Insect flight is a complex system comprised of multiple interacting elements.  Despite recent progress in understanding the underlying unsteady aerodynamics, which are notably different from conventional aerodynamics, relatively little is known about how insects execute flight maneuvers and far less is known about the main mechanisms that determine the diverse behaviors seen in natural flight. We propose an integrated approach to the study of insect flight that incorporates high resolution kinematics of freely flying insects, aerodynamic analysis of wing and body motions, and dynamical systems analysis of these data that will lead to reduced order models. Specifically, we propose three high risk pilot studies: 1) develop automated tracking techniques for 3D flight data that will be essential for aerodynamic and statistical analysis of cross-species comparison of free flight behaviors, 2) provide for the first time a direct connection between the internal muscles to the external observables in free flight through aerodynamics analysis and direct measurements, and 3) perform novel mathematical analysis of stability of free flight and build tools for constructing data-driven reduced order models.We expect that this unprecedented integration of large experimental data sets and numerical analyses will transform research on insect flight. Our work will provide new tools to investigate fundamental issues relating to efficiency, stability, and control in animal locomotion. The techniques, algorithms and routines we develop will be distributed and made available to the research community through our web sites. The PI's will continue with their outreach activities which include: giving public lectures, providing K-12 teaching support, and organizing workshops."
11445,NSF,HHS,"This project proposes to use magnetostratigraphy and single crystal argon dating methodologies to more precisely constrain the age of floras in the Warner Mountains in northeastern California.  These floras are believed to record climatic deterioration from the late Eocene to early Oligocene. A refined geochronology of the Warner Mountains will help resolve whether or not Late Eocene/Early Oligocene boundary cooling was abrupt and synchronous both within the North American continent and globally, and whether it correlates with the Early Oligocene cooling seen in marine oxygen isotope curves. This, in turn, will help the community to better understand the nature of climatic change across North America during the transition from the greenhouse climates of the Eocene to the icehouse climates of the early Oligocene, and should be of broad interest to a wide spectrum of paleontologists, geologists, biologists, and paleoclimatologists.  Outreach efforts by the PI continue to be extensive and will include training undergraduate students in both field and laboratory geology.  The PI has, to date, published peer-reviewed scientific papers with more than 30 of his undergraduate students.  Many of these students have gone on to successfully pursue the PhD at graduate institutions."
11450,NSF,NSF,"Magnetic reconnection is an important physical processes in many areas of plasma physics.  It is especially important in the solar corona, at Earth's magnetopause, and in Earth's magnetotail.  It is thought that anomalous resistivity associated with plasma turbulence plays a significant and perhaps critical role in the physical processes by which magnetic reconnection takes place.  Anomalous resisteivity has been examined many times in terms of quasi-linear theory but a detailed non-linear theory has yet to be found.  This project will develop a fully non-linear theory of anomalous resistivity that arises from the Buneman plasma instability.  There is a significant risk of failure associated with the research, but if successful a non-linear theory of anomalous resistivity has the potential to be transformative."

University of South FloridaBecky Smerdon, Academy for Educational DevelopmentPROJECT SUMMARYThis research project would investigate the determinants and consequences of student enrollment in a new Florida program of high school  career academies  intended to integrate rigorous academic curriculum with industry-driven careers.  The researchers have created some specific hypotheses about curriculum and school organization and their relationship to choosing STEM careers that can be tested with the study they have designed.  The study will use statistical analysis models of existing administrative statistics from the State of Florida to test the influence of attending special  academies  at the high school level to encourage students into STEM fields.  They will test the idea that students attending a special academy had already chosen a particular career before attending the school.  Students attending special schools are likely to have selected the school because of their background.  This study will measure the extent to which Florida students chose their career fields based on the school they would attend or the extent that the school changed their career choice.  Through qualitative analysis they will identify new factors of the schools that affect choices of students to attend them.   The trends study will indicate whether attending these special schools increase STEM course taking among underrepresented students.  The researchers will analyze existing data using a multilevel model to account for both teacher and student variances, will conduct surveys of students in some schools, and will conduct qualitative analysis of course taking."
11496,NSF,HHS,"An award has been made to the University of California at Berkeley under the direction of Dr. Chelsea Specht to study the diversification of floral form and the classification of a family of tropical plants known as heliconias.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop an understanding of the evolutionary history of Heliconiaceae, an ecologically and economically important family of tropical plants. The family Heliconiaceae (heliconias) comprises approximately 215 species (190 currently recognized with an estimated 25 remaining to be described) in the single genus Heliconia, distributed primarily in the neotropics. While heliconias are grown as tropical ornamentals throughout the world, the native range extends from central Mexico to central South America including the Caribbean, with a group of six closely related species native to Indonesia, New Guinea, and several South Pacific islands. Although heliconias are frequently cultivated as ornamentals, there have been no well-supported hypotheses on relationships among species of Heliconia, primarily due to similarities in flower traits that are specific to hummingbird pollination. Species have been divided taxonomically into subgenera based on morphology, but this classification has not been tested.  Heliconia species each maintain intricate and specialized evolutionary relationships with pollinating hummingbirds and herbivorous rolled-leaf hispine beetles, as well as other mutualistic, parasitic, and predatory partnerships. A comprehensive, well-supported phylogeny is necessary to determine species-level relationships within the family and to understand the evolution of floral and vegetative characters involved in such complex interspecies interactions. This phylogeny will be used to (a) reconcile and revise the taxonomy of the family using evolutionary relationships to determine specialized features of subgeneric groupings and (b) interpret evolutionary trends in pollination relationships, herbivore interactions, and tropical biogeography. Training will take place at both graduate and undergraduate levels, incorporating students into all aspects of the research, including field collections, phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses, and the description of new species and higher-level taxonomic groupings."
11507,NSF,NSF,"Distributed collaborative science requires new and powerful technologies to support communication, data sharing and aggregation, access to remote instruments, and large-scale data analysis. The infrastructure necessary to support this kind of science is called cyberinfrastructure. There has been increasing recognition of the importance of the human infrastructure to cyberinfrastructure, the arrangements of organizations and actors that must be brought into alignment in order for work to be accomplished. Infrastructures are complex systems that present challenges that cannot be addressed by either technological or social development alone. A sociotechnical systems approach is necessary to understand how to create long-term, sustainable cyberinfrastructures in order to advance scientific knowledge and practice. This project will address these challenges by undertaking a comparative ethnographic study of two large cyberinfrastructure building and research and learning organizations. Each of these organizations hosts and participates in multiple cyberinfrastructure projects of varying size and complexity. Qualitative research methods will include participant-observation and semi-structured interviews to understand how work practices change and develop over time. The proposed research will: 1) describe how human and technical resources are synergistically re-used across cyberinfrastructure projects, groups, personal networks, and organizations; 2) describe how reuse is encouraged or discouraged by particular social or technical arrangements; 3) describe and analyze how these organizations manage their identities, structures, and boundaries to support organizational learning and innovation; and 4) develop new conceptual models that frame the relationships among organizational-level structures, interpersonal networks, and the production of cyberinfrastructure. Empirically this project will provide an understanding of how cyberinfrastructure centers are approaching the challenges of designing for the emergent, distributed, and long-term. Conceptually this project will develop a framework for understanding: 1) the incremental alignment and realignment of people, processes, and tools; and 2) how these alignments play out: within cyberinfrastructure building organizations, between cyberinfrastructure building organizations, and in collaborations between organizations (or organizational sub-groups), specific projects and their domain communities. In regards to broader impacts, by contributing to a more sophisticated understanding of cyberinfrastructure development, this research will stimulate and support the development of future cyberinfrastructure. Collaborations among institutions conducting work on social aspects of cyberinfrastructure will be established to more efficiently define common concerns. This project will provide opportunities to train a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers by involving undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students. To make innovations more broadly useful, findings will be presented at multi- and interdisciplinary conferences and workshops and published in formats that will be useful to policy-makers."

This project could expand how solid-state chemists, condensed matter physicists, and materials scientists will consider using X-ray diffraction and band theory. In addition, these proposed studies may provide important insights into the structure and electronic characteristics of quasicrystals.  The project could provide unique opportunities to the students participating in this program in experimental and theoretical approaches of materials science. The outreach activities could have tremendous impact on the society with books and TV series about sciences and chemistry in particular.

11533,NSF,HHS,"This proposal extends current research in creating a query languagefor provenance to a broad range of application domains by designing,developing, and evaluating a general-purpose query language forgraph-oriented data.PQL, the path query language, was designed to address the challengesencountered in expressing queries on provenance or lineage data,but it was conceived to be the foundation for a general purposedata model and query language for manipulating any type ofgraph-oriented data.  Graph-oriented data arises in many disciplinesincluding computer networking, information retrieval, biology, websearch, social networking, genealogy, etc.  A characteristic thatunites all these domains is that need for expressing queries onpaths through a graph.  Most existing solutions today have eithera weak or non-existent notion of paths as first-class entities thatcan be named, compared, manipulated and constructed.  PQL addressesthis problem.Derived from the semi-structured database language, Lorel, PQLoperates on semi-structured data, which can be viewed as a collectionof objects linked together.  In PQL, these links are unidirectional,although we support both forward and backward queries across theselinks.  Queries are expressed by selecting and filtering one ormore paths in the graph, where paths can be described by regularexpressions.  Thus, in the provenance domain, one can talk about,''all paths in the graph between invocations of a compiler and theresulting executables.'' In biology, one might pose a query about,''all paths from a particular combination of gene expressions toresulting insulin production.''The work described in this proposal extends PQL to include updatesyntax and semantics and the ability to produce query results thatare graphs constructed from components of the original.  The resultof this work will be captured in both a machine-checkable formalspecification of the language and an open source PQL implementation,complete with a (replaceable) back-end implementation.Further information on the project can be found at the project web page:http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~syrah/pass/"
11597,NSF,NSF,"AbstractAward:  DMS-0805785    Principal Investigator:  Alexander A. VoronovThe goal of the project is to solve a number of importantproblems in the rapidly developing fields of Topological FieldTheory (TFT), Symplectic Field Theory (SFT), and Gromov-Wittentheory. The first part of the project will span from highercategory theory, to cobordisms and to quantum field theories. Theplan is to place cobordisms of manifolds with corners within anappropriate n-category framework and describe TFTs as n-functorsfrom the n-category of cobordisms to that of n-vector spaces, aswell as show that physical models, such as gauge(Wess-Zumino-Witten), Yang-Mills, Chern-Simons, Seiberg-Wittentheories, and sigma-model may be described as such higherTFTs. The second part of the project consists in bringingtogether algebraic geometric and symplectic methods to constructa full solution to the so-called Quantum Master Equation inGromov-Witten theory. This equation describes the topology of themoduli spaces of holomorphic curves and relevant algebraicstructures, providing important invariants in symplectic andalgebraic geometry. The third part of the project aims at liftingGromov-Witten theory to the (Floer) chain level and developing acombinatorial version of Gromov-Witten theory, thus bridging theareas of enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic Floer theory,and graph homology. The last, SFT part of the project will resultin constructing a new compactification of the moduli space ofRiemann surfaces, which would govern the algebraic operations andinvariants arising in SFT.  This compactification will be an SFTanalogue of the Deligne-Mumford compactification relevant toGromov-Witten theory.The project aims at discovering and studying new algebraicstructures in topology suggested or motivated by mathematicalphysics, in particular, string theory, Symplectic Field Theory,and Gromov-Witten theory.  Another long-term goal is to build abridge between several mathematical cultures working on problemsrelated to mathematical physics. These cultures includealgebraists, algebraic topologists, symplectic geometers,algebraic geometers, and geometric topologists, to name afew. The algebraic structures is a mathematical reincarnation ofsuch fundamental structures of physical theories as correlatorsand relations between them (Ward identities). Understanding thisstructure is crucial for understanding the physical theory. Fromthe point of view of mathematics, the project leads to newmathematical ideas, new algebra, geometry, and topology,motivated by physics."

11718,NSF,HHS,"0802187BociuThe International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Lorena Bociu to work with Dr. Jean-Paul Zolesio at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut Non-Lineaire de Nice, Sophia Antipolis, and with Dr. John Cagnol, at Pole Universitaire Leonard de Vinci, in Paris, France.The proposed research is focused on wellposedness and stability of finite energy solutions to nonlinear structural acoustic models with curved walls. Structural acoustic interactions are described by a system of coupled equations: the wave equation, which models the acoustic medium in a 3-D chamber, and the dynamic shell equation, describing the flexible wall of the chamber.  In turn, the motion of a dynamic shellis described by a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, both of hyperbolic type: an elastic wave for the in-plane displacement, and a nonlinear Kirchhoff equation for the scalar normal displacement.  Structural acoustic models, due to their large spectrum of engineering applications, have received a lot of attention in engineering and mathematical literature. However, most of the analysis has been performed on linear models with flat walls. The main novelty of the proposed research is that it will account for nonlinear displacements of the curved wall (i.e. fully nonlinear shell) in a coupling with a nonlinear acoustic medium (nonlinear wave equation). Thus, both nonlinear (topological) and geometric aspects will be at the focus of the proposed research, with Euclidean flat geometry being replaced by Riemannian geometry.  More specifically, the following issues, recognized as open problems in the literature, will be addressed:   First, for a nonlinear shell with nonlinear boundary sources: local and global existence (or blow-up in finite time), uniqueness and regularity of finite energy solutions.  Second, for a 3-D structural acoustic nonlinear model with viscous damping and involving shells on the interface between the media: (i) Hadamard wellposedness of finite energy solutions driven by critical and supercritical sources, along with stability of solutions in the presence of boundary (geometrically restricted) damping, and (ii) quantification of the level of nonlinearity of the damping that is sufficient to ensure that finite energy solutions be global. Thus, nonlinearity of the damping is at the heart of the problem. The solution to this problem will not only provide a novel and important contribution to PDEs and their control, but will also have far-reaching potential for transferable research into engineering-based design.  The project will use the dynamic shell model based on intrinsic geometry developed by M.Delfour and J.P.Zolesio, which offers great advantages for an analytic formulation of the problem. Host J.P.Zolesio is also an expert in analysis and control of interactive structures - a dominant theme in the proposal. The project will also benefit from strong interaction with J. Cagnol, who is well experienced in shell analysis, including computations with intrinsic geometry-based codes.  The proposed research will provide a mathematical solution to a physical problem that is fundamental in application (noise suppression in an acoustic environment). It should also stimulate new approaches in engineering design, eventually impacting society.   The proposed methods could be applied to other PDE models sharing common properties: propagation of singularities, finite speed of propagation and supercriticality. Moreover, good wellposedness theory is fundamental for control theory methods to be applied."

These organisms control the rate of nitrification during which ammonia is converted to nitrate. This often results in nitrogen loss from an ecosystem, because nitrate is leached much more readily than ammonium and nitrate may be converted to gaseous forms of nitrogen, including nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms are very difficult to isolate from environmental samples and consequently the environmental parameters that control their growth have not been identified. A new technique, stable isotope probing with 18O-labeled water, has been developed that does not require cultivation of ammonia oxidizers to study their growth in soil. In this new approach the DNA of only growing microorganisms is labeled with 18O from 18O-water added to soil. The 18O-labeled DNA can be separated from non-labeled DNA so that the abundance of DNA sequences unique to ammonia-oxidizers may be quantified in the labeled DNA fraction. This abundance represents the growth of ammonia oxidizers in soil. The impact of nitrogen source, temperature, plant litter, water, pH and soil bulk density, on growth of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms will be investigated in semi-arid soils in northern Arizona, where mean annual precipitation ranges from 141 to 558 mm.This project will also encompass several important educational initiatives. Native American high school teachers will be offered opportunities to gain research experience in microbiology in order to help them develop curriculum regarding the impact of reclaimed water on the San Francisco Peaks, a sacred site to many tribes in northern Arizona. In addition, an established collaboration with the Center for Science Teaching and Learning at Northern Arizona University will be enhanced by the development of a new course in the Master of Arts in Science Teaching program. The course will focus on how microbiology can be used to teach Arizona content standards in high schools. Finally, each year an undergraduate and a graduate student at Northern Arizona University will be educated in environmental microbiology and will be funded to conduct research."
11787,NSF,NSF,"0528847  Bonner  This project will develop two aquatic particle sensors, test anti-fouling materials, and develop sensor deployment systems and integrated sensor network technology to characterize particles in shallow embayments and other near-shore environments. Both particle sensors will employ flow cytometry principles. The first sensor will be more sophisticated and will provide counts, sizes, and size distributions. It also will discriminate between organic and inorganic particles, abiotic and biotic particles, and live and dead biotic particles. The second sensor will be a less expensive particle-size analyzer. The team of investigators will develop an innovative approach to minimize the biofouling problem that has plagued past efforts to maintain observing systems in highly productive subtropical waters. A robotic system that autonomously lowers the profiler into the water and removes it from the water for cleaning after each set of measurements may provide a simple solution to an important problem."
11803,NSF,HHS,"The objective of this research is the discovery, investigation, and application of low loss, high dielectric constant artificial electromagnetic materials at high frequencies. Of particular interest are materials that can be printed with low temperature methods enabling their direct integration into a wide range of electromagnetic devices. The approach is based on a comprehensive plan of theory, simulation, fabrication and measurement of these materials to prove their properties.Intellectual Merit: The main focus of this research is on multi-scale artificial dielectric materials. Potentially transformative properties of this new class of materials for RF/microwave circuits are obtained through simultaneous incorporation of multiple dielectric enhancement effects on different length scales resulting in a very large effective dielectric constant with small loss tangent. The key attributes of these multi-scale artificial dielectrics that distinguish them from others are low loss and printability. Using these properties and their spatial tailorability, the new artificial materials will be applied to (1) planar antenna miniaturization and gain enhancement, and (2) microwave filter performance enhancement and miniaturization.Broader Impacts: It is anticipated that this new technology will have broad engineering application with special benefit to society. Wide utilization of this technology is foreseen in industrial and academic labs that can benefit from such artificial materials but have been prevented by complexities in designing, manufacturing, and integrating these materials into their devices and subsystems. The research will include both graduate and undergraduate student participation. The research findings will be integrated into two graduate courses and parts disseminated via the internet."
11827,NSF,NSF,"The focus of this proposal is to evaluate the use of instantaneous, chip-wide global information for increasing performance and reducing power and cost in large-scale, chip multi-processors (CMPs).  Using global information contradicts conventional thinking because it has been assumed that traversing the entire chip requires many clock periods.  Recently developed circuits, however, enable single-cycle, chip-wide signaling, suggesting new possibilities of combining global and local information simultaneously.  Further, similar ideas have not been previously implemented in large, traditional multi-chip systems because design flexibility, interconnect configurability, and transistor performance improvements exist only on chip.Preliminary exploration has identified both the required interconnect circuits and opportunities for hardware and software to take advantage of up-to-date global information. The research plans to exploit new circuit techniques that will enable the proposed network-on-chip (NOC)with hybrid interconnect (NOCHI) architecture, which has both a data plane using conventional interconnect techniques and an ultra low-latency control plane with a global interconnect. Because NOCHI ignores established design patterns, understanding the circuit properties is essential for the architectural studies, which include: new algorithms that can better control and regulate power consumption within the network and across cores; improved interaction of the cores with the off-chip memory system to reduce demands on on-chip network resources; the ramifications of global information on cache coherence and management; and software controlled, ultra low-latency efficient synchronization for multicores."
11892,NSF,NSF,"In order to determine where best to deploy limited resources for mitigating earthquake loss in the US, we need to understand when and where earthquakes may occur and how intense their accelerations can be. Every time an earthquake occurs, we gain more understanding of the earthquake problem through measurements of ground motion and modeling of seismic sources. In addition to information derived from earthquakes, we can also benefit from improved understanding of the seismic source through laboratory measurements and modeling, to anticipate what may occur in future earthquakes. One of the great gaps in our understanding of source processes is how shear resistance varies on a fault during rapid co-seismic slip and what this implies about the magnitudes of stress drops and near-fault accelerations. In our proposed work plan we will continue our studies on dynamic friction in rocks and analog materials to better understanding thermally-induced slip weakening processes and their consequences for earthquakes, focusing on studies of flash heating/melting at asperity junctions, and fault zone rheological response when there is rapid change in normal stress. We will employ the plate-impact pressure-shear and the modified torsion Kolsky bar experimental configurations. These experimental techniques, developed in our laboratory at CWRU, have been shown by us in pilot experimental studies funded by SCEC, to provide friction data in the slip-speed and normal stress range of relevance to earthquake physics. Besides being useful in the study of dynamic friction at coseismic slip rates, these experimental configurations allow transients, including sudden alterations in both normal stress and shear loading, to be produced to investigate their effects on the fault strength. These studies will be carried out at both room and higher than room test temperatures. The intellectual merit of this proposal is strengthened by the fact that it addresses some of the outstanding problems in earthquake-physics, including the influence of slip, slip velocity, and alterations in normal stress on fault strength during a typical fault rupture process. The broader aspects of our proposal are strengthened by noting that our proposed research will contribute directly towards reducing losses due to earthquakes in the US in a variety of ways. We will acquire data that are essential for creating realistic models of the earthquake process. Moreover, the proposed program provides exciting opportunities for interdisciplinary research and educational interactions. It involves faculty from two universities?Vikas Prakash from Case School of Engineering, CWRU, and David Goldsby from the Department of Geological Sciences at Brown University. The proposed research program will involve one post-doctoral student and undergraduate students at CWRU. These students will receive valuable and unique interdisciplinary exposure to various aspects of earthquake physics, and will benefit from training in diverse areas such as fault mechanics, fracture mechanics, stress wave propagation, experimental diagnostic techniques, and analytical modeling. The available facilities at CWRU represent the state-of-the-art in high-speed friction testing thereby offering the students involved a unique experimental environment. The University is strongly encouraging the involvement of undergraduate students in cutting edge faculty research, and this would occur for the proposed work as well. Special attention will also be given to recruitment of underrepresented minority students for the project. Dissemination of research results is planned by conference presentations and publications in relevant peer-reviewed journals. Topics in the area of earthquake physics and fault mechanics will undoubtedly enter the departmental seminar series. The PIs will also employ internet and mass-media-based information dissemination to increase awareness of the potential impact of the proposed research in earthquake hazard mitigation. This resource will be available to university level and K-12 students as well as the general public."
11905,NSF,HHS,"Since 1990, Palmer LTER (PAL) research has been guided by the hypothesis that variability in the polar marine ecosystem is mechanistically coupled to changes in the annual advance, retreat and spatial extent of sea ice. Since that time, the hypothesis has been modified to incorporate climate migration, i.e. the displacement of a cold, dry polar climate by a warm, moist climate regime in the northern component of the PAL region, producing fundamental changes in food web structure and elemental cycling. The observed northern changes are affecting all trophic levels and elemental cycling, and the primary mechanism of change involves match-mismatch dynamics. The proposed research builds on previous findings, with a new emphasis on process studies and modeling to elucidate the mechanistic links between teleconnections, climate change, physical oceanographic forcing and ecosystem dynamics. The proposed research will examine the hypothesis that regional warming and sea ice decline associated with historical and on-going climate migration in the northern part of the study area have altered key phenological relationships, leading to changes in species distributions, increasing trophic mismatches and changes in habitat, food availability, ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemical cycling. Through targeted process studies linked to numerical model simulations, the research also will test the hypothesis that deep cross-shelf canyons characterizing the core study region are focal areas for ecosystem processes that result in predictable, elevated food resources for top-predators. The effort includes the addition of 3 new PIs: a zooplankton ecologist with expertise in biogeochemical fluxes, a phytoplankton ecologist focusing on bio-optics and autonomous observations using gliders, and a numerical simulation modeler specializing in coupled global models of ocean circulation, plankton ecology and biogeochemical cycles. The program will add trace metal sampling and analysis, moored physical oceanographic sensors, a moored sediment trap in the south, drifting sediment traps and stable carbon (del 13C) and nitrogen (del 15N) isotope analyses. Missions lasting up to 45 days using gliders deployed before, during and after summer cruises will, along with moorings and satellite remote sensing of sea ice, ocean color, sea surface temperatures and wind fields, greatly extend the observational program in space and time. Since its inception, PAL has been a leader in Information Management to enable knowledge-building within and beyond the Antarctic, oceanographic and LTER communities. PAL has designed and deployed a new information infrastructure with a relational database architecture to facilitate data distribution and sharing. The Education and Outreach program capitalizes on the public's fascination with Antarctica to promote scientific literacy from kindergarten students to adult citizens concerned with climate change and environmental sustainability. Through communicating results to the public and working with scientific assessment bodies (e.g., IPCC) and Antarctic Treaty parties to protect Earth's last frontier, PAL researchers contribute to the national scientific agenda and the greater public benefit."
11922,NSF,HHS,"This grant provides funding for the investigation of theory and computational strategies for solving dense mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. Prior work has focused on sparse MIP problems, but in many applications of MIP technology, the MIP models are often dense.  The research will investigate the facial structure of the independent set polytope via the construction of high-dimensional conflict hypergraphs. Specifically, various structures such as hyper-cliques, hyper-odd holes, hyper-odd antiholes, hyper-webs and hyper-antiwebs will be identified on the conflict hypergraph, and valid inequalities and facet-defining properties will be derived. To investigate the complexity, there will be an analysis on the ranks of the cutting planes associated with the hypergraphical structures. For computational strategies, the research will generalize a separation algorithm for identifying odd holes in hypergraphs, develop fast heuristics for generating the hyper-cliques, and implement the associated cutting planes within a parallel cutting plane and branch-and-cut environment to gauge their effectiveness and performance.If successful, the results of the research will advance the frontiers of knowledge in integer programming in several areas. First, it will lead to fundamental theoretical advances. Second, from a computational standpoint, it will offer new directions of research related to separation strategies for hypergraphic structures. The research will also have an impact in several application areas.  Dense MIP problems arise naturally in many medical applications, including constrained discriminant analysis for medical diagnosis; brachytherapy cancer treatment; and medical imaging. The ability to solve the associated MIP problem instances will help to advance the medical frontiers. The research will also lead to advances in finance and business, including market-share problems, and the wide range of applications that involve classification (constrained discrimination), such as credit lending prediction, market trends, and consumer preference prediction."
11961,NSF,NSF,"The GEMS (Get Educators in Mathematics and Science) project at Florida International University (FIU) is building a model for recruiting, preparing, and successfully inducting STEM discipline majors into the teaching profession. FIU's status as a minority-serving institution offers the unique opportunity to develop this model within a diverse community of traditionally under-represented minorities and women. GEMS is opening new pathways into science and mathematics teaching while supporting 7 undergraduates per year (totaling over 34 during the lifetime of the project). Most GEMS graduates teach in South Florida's diverse public school districts, where they have a significant impact on high needs schools.  GEMS is recruiting talented undergraduate Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics majors into the teaching profession. In addition to providing strong pedagogical content knowledge, the project offers the Noyce fellows further incentives through stipend support and an integrated pre- and in-service support community, ensuring a high likelihood for success and retention in the profession.  As a member of the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC),  FIU's Physics Department and College of Education are deeply engaged in the enterprise of producing more and better-prepared elementary, middle, and high school teachers who are committed to interactive, inquiry-based approaches to teaching. The GEMS  program offers Noyce fellows: (1) a mentor network including faculty mentors at FIU and in-service teachers in local public schools; (2) enhanced early field teaching experiences both on campus and in high school classroom; (3) dedicated on-campus space serving as a central meeting place for the fellows' community; (4) access to guided inquiry-based workshops as part of ongoing in-service teacher programs; (5) regular meetings and events for pre- and in-service teachers; and (6) web-based community access email lists and central web resources for asynchronous support.  The project is investigating factors that bring participants to the program, critical factors for teacher preparation, and factors necessary for successful induction into the teaching profession.  GEMS is providing insight into basic education research topics such as the benefits and challenges of implementing a new teacher education program in a diverse urban environment, the pedagogic development and shift in attitudes towards K-12 teaching by STEM discipline majors, and the changes by faculty in their engagement with and beliefs of supporting teacher education programs.  The project's broader impact includes building an effective model for universities contributing to the production of K-12 STEM teachers, strategies developed within that model, as well as the direct impact of the scholarship recipients on their future students."
11963,NSF,NSF,"This project will address an imbalance in the study of the American postwar physics community. Currently, the historical study of this period revolves mainly around two topics: particle physics theory and experimentation, and relationships between the Cold War military-industrial complex and the academic physics community. Developments in physics outside of these areas have received comparatively little attention. Due to vast expansions in the physics community during this period, the social and intellectual development of this community cannot be easily traced through singular narratives. This project proposes two means for undertaking and encouraging new avenues of analysis: the creation of an internet resource and the undertaking of a research initiative. Both revolve around a reconsideration of the nature of the physics elite. The project will accumulate information on an elite sub-community of roughly 600 members self-selected by the broader physics community (through prizes, appointments, and membership in elite organizations) from 1945-2008. This information will offer insight on the social and intellectual dynamics of the broader community encompassing all of its intellectual, pedagogical, infrastructural, administrative, and advisory facets. With the aid of a Project Assistant, a historical research tool will be created by placing this information on the internet in an Interactive Guide to the American Postwar Physics Elite (IGAPPE). IGAPPE will feature profiles of institutions, lines of research, as well as the ca. 600 aforementioned individuals. The profiles will emphasize precise information (e.g., dates of residency) over commentary; they will be hyperlinked to each other, and will contain references to archives and secondary literature, and links to relevant online resources (many hosted by the American Institute of Physics). IGAPPE will also serve as a pedagogical resource for historians gaining familiarity with this expansive community, and for physics students wishing to understand the background of their own research and discipline. The research initiative component will entail a prosopographical analysis (a collective study of the lives of members of a group that aims to determine patterns of relationships and activities), and it will focus on the information gathered for the assembly of IGAPPE. That study will result in scholarly articles and eventually a book. These will make assertions concerning the nature, role, and attainment of elite status in this period and historiographical representations thereof; they will identify previously neglected nodes of elite activity; and they will speculate on how classes of elites (as opposed to elite individuals) impact the nature of physics and its role in society. The resulting internet reference tool and scholarship from this project will advance broader aims. It will foster new historiographical currents in the study of postwar physics, identify and preserve vital records, and better equip researchers to discuss a broader range of issues of concern to them. The project can be expanded in the future to encompass broader swathes of physics and other scientific communities."
12002,NSF,HHS,"This dissertation research will improve current understandings of regional adaptation to climate change, a problem increasingly recognized as critically important by scientists and policymakers. It will integrate climatology, hydrology, and decision analysis to address a current debate about the importance of risk and risk aversion in climate change assessments. Risk aversion (the desire to manage events so as to avoid risk), is common in human decision-makers, but to date modeling of water resources and climate change have implicitly assumed risk neutrality (indifference to risk). The proposed research will incorporate risk and risk aversion into an integrated assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies in water resources in California's Central Valley. The analysis will proceed in four steps. First, an integrated hydrology and water operations simulation model will describe three basins in California's Central Valley. Second, re-sampling synthetic historical weather time series (and perturbing them based on downscaled GCM data) over many model runs will generate probability distributions for water supply reliability at each demand node in the model. Third, economic techniques for utility function elicitation will be used to determine the risk preferences of water organizations in the study basins. Combining these utility functions with probabilistic output from the hydrology model will allow estimation of expected utility. Finally, scenarios of management options for adapting to projected changes will be analyzed under different assumptions of emissions trajectories, allowing for comparison of the expected utility to each water organization under each modeled scenario. The result will be a clearer understanding of impacts and adaptation than existing studies. The project will make contributions to the study of water resources in the fields of physical geography and risk analysis. First, it will take up theoretical challenges to the widespread assumptions by water planners that future climate will closely resemble that in recorded history. It will produce a method to more clearly articulate the hydrologic risks faced by water managers. Second, in the field of risk analysis, the research will challenge the implicit assumption of risk neutrality in the water resources and climate change literatures. Given that climate change will likely involve increased extreme events and uncertainty about water supply, its projected impacts will likely be significantly greater when risk aversion is explicitly acknowledged. By applying both risk and risk aversion to regional scale climate impacts assessment, this research will produce a set of products that are greater than the sum of the individual parts. The tools produced by this research will have direct application in this and other water resource systems. The hydrology/water operations model will be a more transparent, accessible tool than those that currently exist for modeling water operations in California. In the short term, the model will be useful for sensitivity analysis by stakeholders who currently lack access to such planning tools. In the longer term, the model will be connected with others to form a statewide representation that integrates new functionality, including a dynamic representation of physical hydrology appropriate for climate change assessment. Additionally, this general tool can be applied to topics ranging from environmental assessments to water supply reliability analysis. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."
12029,NSF,HHS,"Aircraft-generated contrails and their resulting cirrus clouds may exacerbate climate warming in those areas characterized by frequent commercial flights. For the United States, the majority of persisting contrails occur as clusters, or  outbreaks , which can persist over relatively large regions (i.e. U.S. Midwest) for many hours. In particular, contrail outbreaks occurring in otherwise mostly clear skies significantly modify radiation and energy budgets, and help reduce the range of temperature in the lower atmosphere between day and night. Their study would allow for evaluating human influences on climatic factors. Recently, some airline companies and foreign governments have expressed a desire to reduce aviation impacts on the environment and climate, including those related to contrails. Realization of this goal requires both a fuller understanding of the space and time-scale characteristics of outbreaks, and an ability to forecast their occurrence in a timely manner, thus potentially permitting horizontal or vertical diversion of high-altitude flights around such areas. This research will determine the geographical and meteorological space and time scales of clear-sky contrail outbreaks through analysis of high resolution satellite imagery with data from composites of key meteorological variables near aircraft cruising altitudes stratified by season and by U.S. sub-regions. These analyses will form the basis for predictive (statistical) models of outbreaks with an eye towards their eventual use in operational forecasting. Geographic Information Systems will be used for both statistical model development---using conventional meteorological data, satellite cloud and moisture retrievals, and aviation data---and for validation of outbreak events conducted on independent data and time periods. Advanced geostatistical techniques will be applied to the imagery containing the outbreaks to simulate their removal and estimate resulting impacts on the radiation and energy budgets and surface temperature. The research also will further clarify the impacts of contrails on Earth surface temperatures and will demonstrate the potential value of implementing the models by focusing on an optimal subset of outbreaks for case study investigation."
12072,NSF,NSF,"The PI's request funding to investigate and quantify the high pressure double pulse LIBS through studies of bubble dynamics and plasma behavior. This effort will guide apparatus and methodology improvements with the goal of increasing the pressure where double pulse LIBS can be effectively used to 250 bar or more. The proposed work will also provide important information about matrix effects at high pressure. The ultimate goal is sufficient understanding of high pressure LIBS to allow its use from an ROV or submersible, and the production of a conceptual design for that purpose.Broader Impacts: One reviewer said that by significantly advancing our abilities for in situ and continuous chemical analysis of the oceans, the proponents are enhancing society's abilities to understand the ocean. The proponents do this while promoting teaching and learning for graduate students in their pursuit of graduate degrees.  Another said that the authors are involved in training students in the LIBS technique and its applications. This is extremely important for a new technique. A useful technique like LIBS will only gain its full advantage as young people grow into the technique. The authors also demonstrate a great record in terms of publication and disseminating information on their work, so I have high hopes that they will continue this good record with the continuation of this work."
12077,NSF,NSF,"The PI's request funding to develop ELISA methods for determination of vitamin B12 in coastal seawater and sediment pore water using both steady and time-resolved fluorescence technologies. A flow injection immunosensor based on immunoaffinity solid-phase extraction will allow rapid in-situ measurement of ultra trace B12 in seawater either by remote control technology, or on board ship. A new fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) planar immunosensor, optimized based on the overlying water methodology, will be utilized for in-situ mapping of 2-dimensional vitamin B12 distribution and transport patterns in bottom deposits.  Vitamin B12 is a microbially produced compound specifically required by phytoplankton for primary production in aquatic systems. It is representative of multiple trace organometallic compounds essential for biological growth and functioning, and has major sources from heterotrophic microbial communities in sediments. Its importance in phytoplankton ecology is just beginning to be understood, and the distribution, transport and factors controlling production patterns of B12 and other biogenic organometallics in marine sediments are essentially undocumented due to lack of suitable analytical tools. The capability for rapid and accurate quantitative or qualitative reconnaissance of vitamin B12 in situ would significantly advance knowledge of biogeochemical cycling of vitamins and related compounds, further reveal the influence of B12 on primary productivity and phytoplankton growth, and provide an enhanced basis for conceptual models and practical management decisions related to nutrient cycling in coastal environments.  The PI?s request funding to develop ELISA methods for determination of vitamin B12 in coastal seawater and sediment pore water using both steady and time-resolved fluorescence technologies.

Broader Impacts:   The proposed work could revolutionize the way we analyze small biomolecules, and may have important applications in fields outside of chemical oceanography, like chemical ecology.  This project has the potential develop a novel sensor that if successful would contribute significantly to our understanding of the influence of B12 in marine systems. These novel technologies (flow immunosensor, planar fluorescence) would be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate curricula, as well to local high school outreach programs to highly motivated students."

12106,NSF,HHS,"Tides rival winds as an energy source for mixing in the deep ocean, yet the pathways of energy transfer from basin-scale tidal flows to turbulent mixing scales are not well understood. Over the past decade, many observations have shown barotropic tidal flow over steep, tall mid-ocean topography generates low-mode (large-scale) internal tides. Most of the energy lost from barotropic tides at these sites is carried away by internal tides with decay scales of O(1000 km). With few in situ observations away from internal tide generation sites, the ultimate fate of these low-mode internal tides and their energy is uncertain. This project will examine how topographic scattering of internal tides from large to small scales dissipates their energy via micro-scale mixing. Topographic scattering may also be a sink for wind-driven near-inertial internal waves. Hutchinson Seamount in the Line Islands Ridge will serve as an ideal test site, which lies in the path of energetic mode-1 internal tides emanating southward from the Hawaiian Ridge. Numerical models show the conversion of energy from a low-mode structure to a localized beam of energy with enhanced vertical shear and mixing. Altimetry provides unambiguous support for the model predictions of energy transfer from mode 1 to 2 downstream of the seamount. This project will observe the internal tide scattering process, quantify the associated mixing relative to the temporal and spatial structures of the scattered waves, verify model predictions, and improve model capabilities. Moorings will be deployed upstream (with respect to the incoming internal tides), on top, and downstream of the seamount for 150 days. A survey on R/V Revelle will provide spatial coverage at 19 stations with lowered acoustic Doppler current profiling/CTD/micro-structure to map 1) the incident and scattered wave fields near the seamount and 2) mixing via direct measurements, Thorpe scales, and fine-scale parameterizations. The mooring time series will isolate the tidal signal from background variability. A new numerical modeling study of the scattering will help refine the sampling plan and interpret the data. Internal tides impact the magnitude and inhomogeneity (in time and space- vertically and laterally) of diapycnal mixing. The meridional overturning circulation is likely not a heat engine, but is driven energetically by deep-ocean mixing. The relevance of global models, most with uniform mixing, of past or future climate is at issue if they are tuned to reproduce present observations, but do not include spatially and temporally inhomogeneous diapycnal mixing. Internal tide scattering is important where baroclinic tides are large and topography is tall and steep, such as in the Western Pacific and at mid-ocean ridges. The investogators will validate their numerical models against their experimental results for 2D and 3D topography in linear and nonlinear regimes. Graduate students and interns will gain experience with state-of-the-art instrumentation. Results will be broadly disseminated to the public by developing in cooperation with other researchers a Wikipedia entry on internal tides, their importance in mixing, and relevance to global circulation and climate. This website is often top ranked in internet searches and has the potential to reach millions of interested people in the general public as well as students. Publication of results in popular science magazines and websites will be sought via a press release from the Scripps Communications Office. Results will be disseminated in the oceanographic community by presentations at the International Union of Geophysics and Geodesy meeting in 2011 and the Ocean Sciences meeting in 2012 and by publishing in peer-reviewed journals."
12156,NSF,NSF,"The investigators will study new methodology in multiple testing in the case where test statistics are dependent.  The objective is to provide extensions of the multiple residual down method (MRD) developed by these investigators.  The extensions encompass important topics such as pairwise comparisons, contrasts, a variety of exponential family distributions, and tests for independence of collections of contingency tables embedded in a large contingency table.  The new methodology and its extensions are expected to have several desirable advantages over current methodology.  Multiple testing is one of the most important practical areas of statistical inference.  Here is a list of areas in which multiple testing is utilized and has impact:  (i) microarray analyses ? the identification of which genes are related to cancer,(ii)monitoring spatial and temporal abundance of bacteria in air samples in US cities, (iii)identifying successful mutual funds, (iv)identifying individual or groups that are vulnerable to disclosure risk, (v)identifying changes in quality in production processes, (vi)determining which blood analytes remain unchanged when new and more efficient blood collection tubes are used, and (vii)identifying which schools are not meeting expected standards. In addition, applications of multiple testing have been used in imaging, analysis of proteins, and numerous other branches of medicine.  Research can provide better and more efficient methodology, which can greatly benefit all those cognate fields."
12174,NSF,HHS,"The research objectives of this award are to 1) develop and calibrate new fiber optic sensors that are fireproof and sensitive to temperature and strain, 2) develop an integrated sensing system and a decision-making tool based on measured strains and temperatures, and 3) validate and demonstrate the developed system in a high-temperature environment for the assessment of the progressive collapse mechanism of steel structures. Building frame models, representing a reduced-scale substructure of the 3-story steel building frame used in SAC Steel Project after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, will be tested under gravity loads at elevated temperatures. To simulate various earthquake effects, the frames will be first subjected to different inelastic stresses with a lateral load. It will then be tested at elevated temperature. As the temperature increases, the steel column degrades (softens) and its ability to carry the dead weights decreases gradually. The progressive collapse of the frame will be monitored with fire-resistant sensors and predicted in real time using the finite element model updating technique.This award results from a collaborative effort of faculty from electrical and civil engineering, thus providing an interdisciplinary training opportunity to participating students in structural health monitoring and condition assessment. If successful, the new sensor technology will enable researchers to measure data at fire-structure interfaces that are critical to fundamental understanding of the fire-induced structural degradation process in post-earthquake fire environments. The developed decision-making tool with FEM will allow a real-time monitoring and assessment of the structural condition of steel buildings in post-earthquake fire environments. Research findings will be integrated into the teaching of an undergraduate senior course that will attract students from a broad range of backgrounds including electrical, civil, and mechanical engineering. The enabling technology will be demonstrated to federal agencies such as FEMA for potential deployment in future disaster responses."
12180,NSF,HHS,"AbstractProposal Number:  ECCS-0821918Proposal Title: Electromagnetic Scattering from 3-D Objects Buried in Layered Lossy Earth with Multiple Rough InterfacesPI Name:            Xu, Xiao-BangPI Institution:  Clemson UniversityThe objective is to investigate scattering of 3-D objects buried in stratified earth with multiple random rough interfaces. The approach is to develop and then employ an efficient hybrid numerical technique based on pseudospectral time-domain method with Monte-Carlo simulation.Intellectual Merit: The proposed research is more advanced than the previously published work by considering stratified media with multiple random rough interfaces, which can more faithfully model the earth and other realistic layered structures that may be encountered in practical subsurface investigations. The proposed numerical technique is based on the pseudospectral time-domain method, which is more efficient than the conventional finite-difference time-domain method, due to its significantly less computer time and memory requirement for the same or even higher accuracy, as illustrated by many published numerical experiment results. The pseudospectral time-domain technique can also deal with complex geometry with a great flexibility, and has potential for parallel computations.  Broader Impacts: The proposed research may benefit the society through a number of important potential applications in various areas including: detection of subsurface targets such as landmines for protection of our troops; geophysical exploration of mineral deposit, petroleum, and alternative energy resources such as geothermal spots; locating buried hazardous waste for environment protection; nondestructive testing of underground pipes and other underground facilities; microwave imaging of abnormal area embedded in multi-layer biological structures for detection of cancers; and modeling of indoor wave propagation through multi-layer walls for wireless internet planning. The research will also enhance three graduate courses and train five students."
12195,NSF,HHS,"The ability to develop legged robots that can effectively run over flat, inclined, uneven and deformable surfaces is critical to a wide range of civilian (e.g., search and rescue) and military (e.g., reconnaissance, mine detection) applications. This task has proven particularly problematic to traditional control strategies, yet many animals, unlike their synthetic counterparts, are able to transcend complex environments such as jungles, caves, deserts, buildings, and piles of rubble with remarkable ease. Despite their miniscule size, insects can function in almost any environment by means of their ability to climb, crawl, or run as the situation demands. Although recent progress has been made in the development of bio-inspired robots capable of locomotion over uneven ground, and others that can (slowly) climb sheer surfaces, no legged machines currently exist that can dynamically operate in a combination of vertical and horizontal regimes.  The recent discovery that rapidly climbing cockroaches and geckos utilize their legs to actively pull the body toward the feet, rather than pushing the body away as in running, has inspired a new dynamic model for vertical running and the construction of the first dynamic climbing robot. The salient feature of this climbing model and robot is the intentional utilization of large lateral pulling forces when rapidly climbing. Since these pulling motions observed experimentally do not appear to provide an obvious energetic advantage, we hypothesize that this type of side to side climbing is driven primarily by stability considerations. This project pursues an integrated study of insect biomechanics, dynamic modeling, and robotic synthesis to determine the importance and proper utilization of lateral oscillations in running and climbing over various degrees of incline. The study seeks to answer these questions not only to provide insight into animal biomechanics, but also to produce guiding principles that can be utilized to develop the next generation of dynamic legged robots.  In particular we aim to understand the connection between neuromuscular control strategies in insects and functional performance in changing environments (i.e. slope and substrate), develop reduced order models to determine how lateral motion pattern contribute to improved stability and locomotion performance, and develop a novel robotic test platform to empirically test the predictions of the bio-inspired locomotion models and provide insight into how lateral dynamics can be explicitly utilized to improve the mobility of legged robots over varying terrain and substrates."
12196,NSF,NSF,"Across all science and engineering disciplines, research is conducted in theoretical, experimental, and computational modes.  In some disciplines, such as meteorology, the dominant mode of research is computational.  Yet extant instructional materials for responsible conduct of research focus on ethical issues that arise in experimental research, and do not address specific issues that arise in computational modeling and research.  In this project which encompasses a combination of research and education, the PIs will determine empirically the ethical issues and accepted standards for the responsible conduct of computational modeling and research, in a form suitable for teaching graduate students.  Specifically, the PIs will articulate the standards for model integrity and validity, model robustness, representations and visualizations, data and code integrity, and intellectual property.  They will develop instructional materials, case studies and associated commentaries to teach these standards to graduate students in science and engineering, will assess the quality and effectiveness of the instructional materials, and will disseminate them through conferences, journals, and the Web.  The expertise of the project team includes computational dynamics, computational biomechanics, engineering ethics, instructional design, and educational assessment.Broader Impacts:  In collaboration with both graduate and undergraduate students, the PIs will develop cases based on actual situations, and commentaries on the cases for teaching the professional standards of computational modeling to graduate students in science and engineering.  These materials will be tested and assessed with students and instructors in two institutions, and with professionals at technical conferences.  The materials will be disseminated through academic conferences and archived at the Online Ethics Center of the National Academy of Engineering.  The standards will be proposed for inclusion in the publication guidelines of research journals."
12197,NSF,HHS,"As safety-critical systems become increasingly more complex, statutory certification organizations are increasingly mandating that formal techniques be used to prove that such systems meet their specifications. Techniques from real-time scheduling theory are commonly applied during this proof process to demonstrate compliance with temporal specifications.  This project focuses on the emerging field of meta-real-time scheduling theory.  Meta-scheduling theory attempts to understand those properties that cause certain scheduling-theoretic techniques to be more successful than others in designing and implementing real-time systems, and seeks general principles that are common to such successful techniques.  The objective is to identify several such principles and establish that scheduling techniques complying with these principles are more likely to yield error-free real-time systems. We will seek methods of deriving scheduling techniques that are compliant with these principles. Using these techniques, the project seeks to provide theoretical foundations for the analysis of timing constraints in such systems, and obtain new methodologies for obtaining system designs that are provably correct by construction (thereby concurrently obtaining both correct designs and their formal proofs of correctness). Broader impacts include joint research with industry colleagues, building on strong expressions of interest from system designers in the topics and possible outcomes of this research.  All tools and development platforms implemented as part of this project are being made public, and can be used by other institutions for research and teaching purposes."

12209,NSF,NSF,"Proposed research will improve the accuracy and efficiency of numerical simulations in unbounded domains. Investigations in two important areas of fluid dynamics are pursued. The first is the development of absorbing boundary conditions based on the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) technique for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent flows. Following recent successes of extending the Perfectly Matched Layer methodology to the nonlinear Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, further development of the PML technique for Large Eddy Simulation of turbulent flows is proposed. Formulations of absorbing equations for LES, as well as other turbulent flow simulation, such as the time-dependent Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations, are proposed. The second area of research is the development of non-reflecting boundary conditions for numerical schemes for the Boltzmann-BGK equation in gas kinetic theory. Proposed work will develop, analyze and implement the absorbing boundary condition based on the Perfectly Matched Layer methodology. Implementation and analysis of PML absorbing boundary condition in the Lattice Boltzmann Method will also be carried out in proposed research.Due to the ubiquity of non-reflecting boundaries and the importance of Large Eddy Simulation in the computational studies of complex turbulent flows, proposed work will have a direct impact on the quality and efficiency of a broad class of numerical simulations in computational fluid dynamics and computational acoustics, such as in the reduction of airframe and jet noises, in studies of turbulent combustion in reactive flows, and in numerical models for weather predictions. The PML for the Boltzmann-BGK equation developed in proposed research is applicable to a diverse field of scientific investigations that employ the kinetic theory, such as multiphase and multi-component flows, microfluidics in nanotechnologies, particle suspensions and microflows in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)."
12228,NSF,HHS,"This project will start to integrate what we know about the challenging task of recognizing objects from visual inputs, by drawing on the highest-performing artificial neural network systems, new models of deep belief learning from cognitive science, and new experiments on the visual cortex. The most transformative aspect of this work is that it will aim at decisive experiments which challenge traditional assumptions about purely local feedback in the learning system as such, assumptions which are prevalent in today,s mathematical models of learning in neural circuits. Many engineers and more classical systems neuroscientists believe that these assumptions are obviously false, but a decisive set of experiments would be crucial in encouraging new types of computational models of the brain, including models which fit with what actually works in image processing in technology. On the other hand, if the experiments begin to show how such learning capabilities are actually possible within the traditional paradigm, that would be equally transformative. Brain-like capabilities in image processing are an additional goal of this work; image processing is a large and growing part of the nation's cyberinfrastructure."
12234,NSF,NSF,"The value of computer-generated protein structural models in biological research and practice relies critically on their accuracy. However, development of high-resolution computational approaches that can reliably produce protein structural models with or close to experimental quality remains an unsolved problem, though significant advances have been made in the past ten years. The main difficulties include the tremendously large and complex protein conformation space and, more importantly, the absence of scoring functions with satisfactory accuracy as well as sensitivity. In this project, the research seeks to answer a challenging question ? can one still model protein structures with high accuracy using the existing scoring functions which are potentially insensitive and inaccurate? Different from the common approaches of globally optimizing a scoring function describing the conformational energy, the investigators explore a new direction to model protein structures via efficiently sampling the common low score regions in multiple carefully-selected knowledge-based, physics-based, or regression-based scoring functions. This new approach addresses the scoring function insensitivity problem based on the assumption that the native or native-like conformations should satisfy most of the existing good scoring functions by yielding low score values. Sampling multiple scoring functions allows toleration of insensitivity and deficiency in individual scoring functions and identification of conformations that can best satisfy most scoring functions, which will eventually lead to significant resolution improvement.  The investigators verify this sampling strategy by applying it to a proof-of-concept ab initio protein loop structure prediction problem. The work involves integrating multiple scoring functions, including triplet torsion angle score, physical energy, distance-based potential, loop closure score, and others, into the sampling scheme with the goal of reliably predicting loop backbone structures with near experimental resolution. The computational tools for loop structure prediction are being made available as a software package to the protein modeling research community."
12241,NSF,NSF,"Kevin C. Nolan, under the supervision of Dr. William S. Dancey, will examine the pattern of environmental exploitation and the village structure at the Fort Ancient (AD 1000-1650) Reinhardt site. Recent investigations shed light on important aspects of local variability for the Fort Ancient Tradition and other Ohio Valley Late Prehistoric groups. However, there is a paucity of investigated Late Prehistoric sites in the Central Scioto Valley. This investigation will add valuable knowledge about the variability of the human condition during the Fort Ancient period.First, Nolan will examine the availability and use of resources by the Reinhardt inhabitants. The subsistence choices of the villagers will be reconstructed by recovery of floral and faunal remains from a sample of remote-sensing identified features. The recovered material will be compared against expectations based on the distribution of habitat types and the availability of specific resource types. This will allow examination of relative procurement costs incurred by the village inhabitants for specific resources and may give clues as to resource stress.Second, this project will contribute to understanding the range of variability in Fort Ancient settlement organization. Knowledge of community organization is important for evaluating intra-community social relations. Fort Ancient sites have been argued to exhibit variability in settlement structure through time. However, many investigations expose only small portions of sites. Specifically, previous studies in the Central Scioto Valley have either exposed small portions of the village or were conducted prior to modern excavation and recording methods. As a result, there is little data on the organization of Fort Ancient communities in the Central Scioto Valley and no concept of variability. This project provides an opportunity to document the site structure of an Early Fort Ancient site in the Central Scioto Valley through a combination of geophysical survey, intensive surface collection, shovel test sampling, and feature excavation.This project contributes to current trends towards documenting local cultural variability. The appropriate starting point for such an analysis is the individual site. This project will build a model of Fort Ancient subsistence and settlement structure that captures spatial and temporal variability. This model is built from the site outwards, combining the Reinhardt site results and several recent projects utilizing the digital state site records database. Understanding of variability and persistence are crucial to building theoretically informed narratives of cultural change over time.In addition to helping Nolan to complete his doctoral degree, this project will inform local educational outreach efforts. Nolan already incorporates current archaeological knowledge into public outreach presentations and has funding to facilitate the production of pamphlets to accompany these outreach presentations. The pamphlets and the future presentations will present a nuanced illustration of Ohio Late Prehistory that is understandable by the general public and embraces the goals of public education. In addition, this project will facilitate preservation planning by and for the City of Columbus, Ohio. NSF support, coupled with funding already obtained, will aid in the preservation, education, and presentation of significant cultural remains for the people of Ohio."
12273,NSF,NSF,"PROPOSAL NO: 0429924INSTITUTION: Georgia Tech Research Corporation - GA Institute ofTechnologyPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Manolios, PanagiotisTITLE: System-Level Processor Verification Using RefinementAbstract:The objective of this proposal is to develop a formal refinement-based methodology for term-level microprocessor verification and to apply it to complex designs. State-of-the-art microprocessors are extremely complex and industry estimates of validation costs, as a percentage of the engineering effort required to develop a new product, range from 30% to as high as 70%. Even with such resources allocated to validation, bugs are common and the trend toward more complex designs will exacerbate the problem. Current validation efforts focus on checking low-level properties of small components. However, it is difficult to imagine a set of properties that captures system-level correctness, which is why the project advocates a refinement-based approach, where the instruction set architecture is the specification. This means that to an external observer, the processor behaves in a fashion that is consistent with the instruction set architecture, with respect to both safety and liveness properties. The project proposes to develop a theory of refinement for system-level verification and to apply it to complex term-level designs. The refinement-based approach will be part of a design-for-verification methodology that complements the design cycle, that can be automated in a compositional, scalable way, and that is generally applicable across a wide spectrum of designs."
12279,NSF,HHS,"The research focuses on stochastic analysis for systems with fractional Brownian motions with particular application to control problems. Since the available results for the solutions of stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motions are very limited, the investigation of explicit solutions of multidimensional bilinear equations and the existence and uniqueness of solutions of nonlinear equations is proposed. The explicit solutions for bilinear equations requires a combination of Lie theory and stochastic analysis and the explicit solutions provide an important method for solving various stochastic problems for bilinear equations. These stochastic differential equations should provide useful models for many physical phenomena. The stochastic optimal control of multidimensional linear systems driven by fractional Brownian motions and a quadratic cost functional for a finite time interval is proposed. Furthermore this controlled system with an ergodic cost is also proposed for study. In both cases the optimal control uses a prediction of the increments of a fractional Brownian motion. The ergodic control problem is the natural setting for an adaptive control problem for these linear systems. The adaptive control problem requires the identification of the unknown parameters of the linear system and the construction of a self-optimizing adaptive control. Some parameter identification schemes are proposed such as a weighted pseudo least squares algorithm to obtain strongly consistent estimators of the parameters.The proposal describes the investigation of some stochastic models that use a family of stochastic processes called fractional Brownian motions which arose empirically in a model for the rainfall along the Nile River. The potential usage of these processes has been demonstrated for economic data, telecommunications, device noise, and medicine. To have useful stochastic models with fractional Brownian motions it is necessary to have information about the solutions of the equations. This is one goal of the proposal. Many stochastic models are also controlled and with a cost criterion an optimal control is sought. In the research some control problems for linear systems with a quadratic cost functional will be studied. Often some parameters of the system are unknown and it is also required to control the system. These problems require that the parameters are identified and a control is determined based on the estimates of the parameters. Such problems with controlled linear systems and fractional Brownian motion will be investigated."
12294,NSF,NSF,"The advent of multicore platforms has led to renewed interest in multiprocessor real-time systems, with considerable recent work directed at scheduling issues.  Unfortunately, the equally-important topic of synchronization, in comparison, has been somewhat neglected.  Indeed, the most influential work on this topic was done decades ago, at a time when multiprocessor real-time applications were deemed to be mostly of  academic  interest only.  The objective of this project is to re-visit the issue of real-time synchronization in light of the ongoing multicore revolution, with the goal of devising mechanisms that can be practically applied.  The fundamental thesis of this project is  simplicity wins.   Specifically, real-time synchronization mechanisms, though generally applicable, should be designed with common-case scenarios in mind, using simple techniques that can be reasonably analyzed.  This begs the question: What is the common case? To determine this, trace data is collected in this project concerning the synchronization behavior of a wide range of real-time applications.  This data is then being used to produce real-time synchronization benchmarks, which will guide development efforts.  These efforts consider: real-time multiprocessor locking protocols; techniques for supporting read-mostly synchronization; the use of transactional memory and non-blocking synchronization in real-time applications; and synchronization techniques that can be applied in settings where both real-time and non-real-time components co-exist.  Broader impacts include joint research with industry colleagues at AT&T, Honeywell, IBM, Intel, and Sun, and the development of publicly-available open-source software that can be used by other institutions for research and teaching purposes."
12338,NSF,NSF,"This award is an outcome of the NSF 08-519 program solicitation George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research (NEESR) competition and includes the University at Buffalo-SUNY (lead institution), University of California, Berkeley (subaward), University of Washington (subaward), California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (subaward), and the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (subaward). This project will utilize the NEES equipment sites at the University at Buffalo and the University of California, Berkeley.  Structural walls are widely used as seismic lateral-force-resisting components in buildings and nuclear facilities. Since most building structures are low-rise with columns spaced at approximately 30 feet on center and walls cast between columns, most structural walls are squat with aspect ratios of 1.0 or less. Conventional walls are constructed of reinforced concrete (RC). Currently, the design of these walls is based on demand/capacity equations addressing shear strength and prescriptive detailing requirements, which were developed for tall (high aspect ratio) walls, to ensure ductility. However, analysis of squat wall test data shows that current design equations result in a significant bias and scatter in the ratios of estimated to measured strength. As such, squat walls stand out among RC structural elements because of the large uncertainties in characterizing their behavior. Such bias and uncertainties are unacceptable for modern performance assessment methodologies for which unbiased estimates of strength and stiffness are needed as a function of deformation and load history. The goal of this project is to fill the substantial gaps in knowledge noted above by developing curated numerical and visual experimental data on the seismic response of large-scale squat reinforced concrete wall specimens, validated tools for simulation of the seismic response of squat reinforced concrete walls, code-oriented design equations and improved prescriptive details to achieve specified levels of performance, fragility data suitable for immediate use in performance-based seismic assessment and design of conventional and nuclear structures, and teaching tools to effectively explain the resistance and failure mechanisms of squat walls. The unique experimental capabilities of the NEES equipment sites at Buffalo and Berkeley will be used to execute the large-scale cyclic and hybrid-simulation experiments that must be performed to develop the datasets required to prepare robust numerical simulation, design guidance, and loss modeling tools. Other researchers will be able to use the curated experimental results to further advance understanding with alternate theories and numerical models. Physical experiments followed by numerical simulations will  be used to develop guidance for structural engineers and loss/risk modelers on how squat reinforced concrete walls in buildings and nuclear structures perform during earthquakes.  This project will advance fundamental science and knowledge in engineering with substantial intellectual benefits to the structural engineering and loss modeling communities. Both disciplines will contribute to and benefit from the integrated physical and numerical simulation studies. The project will also train Ph.D. students, bring in undergraduate students from a teaching university, engage underrepresented students, impact building code development and performance-based seismic design, and outreach to a broad spectrum of end-users in the United States and abroad via web-accessed media, a Virtual Annual Meeting, and a Practice Committee composed of expert design professionals.  Data from this project will be made available through the NEES data repository (http://www.nees.org)"
12344,NSF,HHS,"Energy efficiency is rapidly becoming a key constraint in the design of enterprise systems. By 2011, yearly data center energy consumption in the United States is projected to grow to over 100 billion kWh at cost of $7.4 billion. As much as 40% of this energy is consumed by DRAM and disks. Portable consumer devices, where battery life has long been a key concern, instead use faster and more energy-efficient Flash storage. Flash is non-volatile, has near-zero standby power draw, and each Flash read requires 30x less power than a DRAM read and three orders-of-magnitude less power than a disk access. Moreover, Flash provides far lower access latency and higher bandwidth than disks, approaching DRAM performance levels.  Enterprise storage vendors have recently announced products that replace traditional disks with high-capacity Flash solid-state disks (SSDs). However, because they are accessed through interfaces optimized for legacy rotating disks, SSDs fail to fully-exploit the low latency and high bandwidth Flash can provide. Furthermore, replacing conventional disks with SSDs does not address the growing power consumption of severs' DRAM. In this project, we examine further opportunities, beyond SSDs, to save energy with Flash in enterprise systems by integrating Flash throughout the servers' storage and memory hierarchies.  The long term goal of our research--to improve data center energy efficiency--has the potential to drastically reduce the carbon footprint of data centers and the need for additional power generation capacity."

12355,NSF,HHS,"Abstract for NSF Proposal 0802803  Global invariants for complex varieties with isolated singularities and applications       Yau's research proposal contains projects in seven areas:(1) Fundamental problems in complex geometry on complex varieties and on    C^N and their relationship.(2) Higher order Bergman functions and their explicit computation.(3) Explicit computation of biholomorphic maps between complete Reinhardt    domains in complex varieties with only quotient singularities.(4) Construction of infinitely many continuous numerical invariants for    complete Reinhardt domains in complex varieties with only quotient    singularities.(5) Construction of the moduli spaces of complete Reinhardt domains or    strictly pseudoconvex domains in complex varieties.(6) Geometry of the moduli spaces of complete Reinhardt domains in    complex varieties.(7) Rigidity of CR morphisms between compact strongly pseudoconvex CR    manifolds.Yau introduces higher order Bergman functions for domains in complex varieties with only isolated normal singularities. These Bergman functions are invariant under biholomorphic maps. He intends to use these Bergman functions to study the problem of biholomorphic equivalence of domains in complex varieties. Yau observes that his higher order Bergman functions put a lot of restriction on biholomorphic maps between two complete Reinhardt domains in a variety, from which these biholomorphic maps can be determined explicitly. He develops a new technique to construct a family of infinite number of continuous numerical invariants on complete Reinhardt domains lying in the same variety. He shows that this family of infinite number of continuous numerical invariants is actually a complete set of invariants for either the set of all strictly pseudoconvex complete Reinhardt domains in the variety or the set of all pseudoconvex complete Reinhardt domains with real analytic boundaries in the variety. In particular, the moduli spaces of these domains in the variety are constructed explicitly as the images of this complete family of numerical invariants. He illustrates how this works in a concrete example of A_1-variety. It is well known that A_1-variety is the quotient of cyclic group of order 2 on C^2. Yau proves that the moduli space of complete Reinhardt domains in A_1-variety coincides with the moduli space of the corresponding complete Reinhardt domains in C^2. Since his complete family of numerical invariants are computable he has solved the biholomorphically equivalent problem for a large family of domains in C2. He proposes to continue his work for any quotient singularities. He also proposes to study the rigidity problem of CR morphisms between two strongly pseudoconvex compact CR embeddable manifolds of the same dimension. If the dimension is at least five and the codimension of the target manifold is relatively small, he shows that non-constants CR morphisms are necessarily CR biholomorphisms. He plans to prove the most general rigidity theorem of CR morphisms between two strongly pseudoconvex compact CR embeddable CR manifolds of the same dimension.    It is well known that singularities theory plays an essential role in main stream of mathematics as well as many branches in Science. For example, by taking a cone over a projective manifold, one can get an isolated singularity at the origin. The classification of projective manifolds can be achieved via the classification of islated singularites.Therefore in some sense algebraic geometry is contained in the theory of singularities. The Black Holes can also be viewed as singularities of our universe. We encounter singularities in our daily life. Anythings which are not smooth (for example table corner) can be think of as singularities. Hence it is very important for us to understand singularities structures. This project proposes a new way to understand the global structures of singularities. Yau's NSF grant was used to partially support the Midwest Workshop on Complex Analysis and Complex Geometry, April 13--15, 2007 at University of Illinois at Chicago. There were 11 speakers, two of them are female. Yau and Song-Ying Li have organized a Special Session ``Analysis and CR Geometry'' for AMS meeting at De Paul University Oct. 5--6, 2007. There are 23 speakers. The P.I. was the adviser of a high school student Letian Zhang who was selected as the final 40 in the Intel Science competition. Yau and Zhang paper was published in Math Research Letter. Currently the P.I. is advising two high school students for the Intel Science Competition. One of them is a female student. Yau has a female student who finished her Ph.D. this year.He still has 7 graduate students working for their Ph.D., one of them is an African American.

12374,NSF,NSF,"As the evolution of living species is determined by few basic mechanisms, such as genetic heritage, genetic variation, and natural selection, it may be that the evolution of large-scale internetworks is similarly determined by simple, but still unknown, principles.The investigators aim to discover the fundamental character of network evolution, the laws that describe it, and ways in which networking researchers or innovators can effectively influence this process.This research can cause a paradigm shift in the way we understand the Internet and on how we attempt to introduce new features and correct its problems. The project also has a significant education component, including a new course that is cross-listed in the computer science and biology graduate programs of Georgia Tech. The first thread of this research focuses on the evolution of the Internet Autonomous System (AS) ecosystem. The goal is to better understand this complex and dynamic ecosystem, the behavior of entities that constitute it, and the nature of interactions between those entities. ASes attempt to optimize their utility or financial gains by dynamically changing the ASes they interact with, and thus by changing the organization of their ecosystem.In the second research thread, the focus is on the evolution of network design and architecture and on the laws and principles that determine the evolution of large-scale internetworks. The investigators will explore questions about the price of evolution in network design, the trade-offs between evolutionary and clean-slate architectures and the evolutionary implications of layered network organization. The objective is not only to understand the evolution of the Internet, but also to provide concrete guidelines for the design of evolvable architectures for the Future Internet."
12387,NSF,NSF,"This project explores an architecture, mechanisms, and interfaces for helping users manage access control in the digital home.The home is a challenging, yet critical, target for usable security.It requires abstractions that are intuitive for laypeople, interfaces that allow users to manipulate those abstractions, and access-control and storage infrastructure that can support the abstractions.  Without a holistic, usable approach to access-control management, adoption of new technology in the home will be slowed and there will be no effective data security once the transition inevitably occurs.  Based on their early experiences with home storage, the PIs seek to adapt and integrate:(1) the semantic query as an abstraction for describing a set of files to which a specific policy applies;(2) the Expandable Grid as a visual interaction technique for creating, editing, and viewing security policies;(3) logic-based access control as a rigorous foundation for specifying and implementing policies.User studies, surveys, and test deployments are a core component of the project; they are used to discover needs of users in the digital home and users' ability to effectively apply approaches developed.The project has several forms of impact.  First, it develops tools and techniques that can significantly simplify the use of access control in the digital home.  Second, it increases understanding of user behavior and access-control needs in the emerging home storage environment.  Third, it enhances education at CMU and elsewhere, as new insights are embedded into storage systems, distributed systems, and computer security classes taught by the PIs."
12398,NSF,NSF,"When systems rely on a  human in the loop  to carry out a security-critical function, cyber trust indicators are often employed to communicate when and how to perform that function.  Indicators typically serve as warnings or status indicators that communicate information, remind users of information previously communicated, and influence behavior. They include a variety of security- and privacy-related symbols in the operating system status bar or browser chrome, pop-up alerts, security control panels, or symbols embedded in web content. However, a growing body of literature has found the effectiveness of many of these indicators to be rather disappointing. This research is systematically studying the effectiveness of cyber trust indicators and developing approaches to making these indicators most effective and usable.  The researchers are using cognitive psychology's  mental models  approach to study how both expert and non-expert personal computer users understand common cyber trust indicators. They are also using the  Communication-Human Information Processing  (C-HIP) model from warnings science to structure their evaluation and provide insights into the human information processing steps at which a warning is mostly likely to fail. Using an iterative design process, they are developing improved indicators for several common applications and evaluating the effectiveness of these indicators. The expected results include a set of specific recommendations for improving a set of common cyber trust indicators, a set of design patterns for designing effective cyber trust indicators, and a curriculum module for teaching students how to design effective and usable cyber trust indicators."

12463,NSF,NSF,"Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to develop ultra-sensitive and compact magnetometers, featuring the direct on-chip integration of magnetoelectric sensors, with advanced microelectronics, for non-invasive medical imaging. The approach is based on the potential of picoTesla magnetic sensitivity using integrated magnetoelectric composites. This research aims to further improve the sensitivity beyond those based on the direct stress mediated magnetoelectric coupling by improving the mechanical impedance match between the constituents, by exploring totally new magnetoelectric coupling, and by incorporating MEMs-based structures as resonant moving gates of MOSFETs for further amplification. Intellectual Merit:  The demonstration of a heterogeneous integration strategy at the devices and circuits level that seamlessly merges microelectronics with sensors holds great promise of enabling transformational shifts in the semiconductor and sensor industry. Further, the proposed research will provide fundamental understanding on the magnetic energy transfer efficiency between the constituents of the composites. The research will also provide insight into design and fabrication of resonant moving gate transistors that markedly improve the sensor performance.Broader Impact:  The successful development of chip scale magnetic sensors will revolutionize the field of biomagnetic field detection and imaging. Moreover, the availability of low cost diagnostic tools will greatly facilitate early disease detection. On the education and outreach font, this research will foster an interdisciplinary educational program that will inspire students to understand fundamental materials science and device physics and incorporate them into solid-state device fabrication to address complex detection and diagnosis problems in the life science and biomedical imaging area."
12479,NSF,HHS,"This award is an outcome of the NSF 08-519 program solicitation George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research (NEESR) competition and includes the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) (lead institution) and Harvey Mudd College (sub-award). This project will utilize the NEES equipment sites at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The research outcomes will allow engineers to appropriately and economically account for seismic loading on wind turbines. This will further facilitate expansion of a main source of Green renewable energy, and ensure minimal disruption to the critical resource that wind power provides. The project will be conducted in collaboration with industry representatives in order to further focus the research effort on the most significant practical needs today. Related educational outreach activities will allow undergraduate students to participate in the utilization of the involved NEES world class testing facilities. In addition, the project team will develop related internet dissemination applications for K-12 and undergraduate students.  In the United States, the 2006 investment in wind turbines was on the order of $4 billion. This growth shows no sign of slowing with the Department of Energy (DOE) goal of expanding the number of wind turbines fivefold by 2015. A significant portion of this growth is in earthquake prone states. For instance, more than a quarter of the new capacity installed in 2005 and 2006 was in the seismically vulnerable States of California and Washington.  New wind turbines are also becoming increasingly taller and heavier, standing vertically in excess of 200 feet (taller than a twenty-story building), and thus increasing the significance of potential earthquake loads. If seismically vulnerable, numerous turbines of a given vintage in a large wind farm may be damaged, leading to substantial economic consequences. In order to address this challenge, the proposed research will utilize NEES facilities to provide the needed experimental data and insights for developing validated rational analysis and design procedures.  The NEES equipment operated by UCLA will be used to conduct a comprehensive field investigation to quantify the dynamics of actual operating wind turbines. Experiments using the outdoor UCSD NEES shake table will provide insight into the potential damage modes of wind turbines when subjected to earthquake shaking. Findings from these tests will be used to construct and validate computational models that will further extend the testing results. These models will be used to develop a framework for seismic analysis and design of wind turbines. Intellectual merit in this effort stems from providing the first experimentally validated seismic design procedure for wind turbines worldwide. Data from this project will be made available through the NEES data repository (http://www.nees.org)."

The researcher will examine how urban renewal experts and squatter settlement residents reconcile conflicting notions of spatial usage and habitation when public housing is constructued within squatter spaces.The research will be carried out in Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third largest city. During the first phase of the project, the researcher will conduct archival research to become familiar with the history of housing policies, urban renewal, and squatter settlements (favelas) in Belo Horizonte.  In the following phases, the researcher will conduct in-depth interviews with urban renewal experts and favela residents before and after relocation to new public housing units, and observe at participatory planning meetings where both experts and residents are present.  The researcher also will collect visual documents, such as hand-sketched drawings of houses, photographs of interior domestic spaces, and aerial maps, which he use to elicit ideas about the city and use of space from informants.The research will shed light on how governments can work more effectively with residents of squatter settlements, and whether relocation to public housing provides a channel for traditionally marginalized residents to acquire more rights and legitimacy as citizens. It thereby will contribute to social science theories of place, space, urban governance, and citizenship. The research also will contribute to the education of a graduate student."
12488,NSF,HHS,"AST-0807830BaragiolaThis research addresses radiation effects on surface ices in outer solar system objects using laboratory techniques.  Effects that alter the appearance of the ices are of special interest because they are significant for remote sensing of icy satellites, planetary rings and trans-Neptunian objects.  Effects being explored include: a) the stability of molecules trapped in ice subject to ultraviolet solar radiation and magnetospheric ion impact; b) the relative efficiency of photons, electrons, light and heavy ions in affecting crystalline ice; and c) the electrostatic charging of surface ice by energetic particle impact.  The research will use a unique combination of experimental techniques: exposure to ion, electron and laser beams and vacuum ultraviolet light, optical spectroscopy and interferometry, and microgravimetry and mass spectrometry at cryogenic temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum.Broader impacts include inspiring students and educating them in the characteristics needed for quality research, professional development of early career scientists, and increased participation of under-represented groups.

12498,NSF,HHS,"The goal of this project is to develop a stream processing system that captures data uncertainty from data collection to query processing to final result generation. This project focuses on data that is naturally modeled as continuous random variables. For such data, it employs a principled approach grounded in probability and statistical theory to capture data uncertainty and integrates this approach into high-volume stream processing. The first contribution of the project is to capture uncertainty of raw data streams from sensing devices. Since the raw streams may not present data in a format suitable for query processing and can be highly noisy, this project employs probabilistic models of the underlying data generation process and machine learning techniques to efficiently transform raw data into a desired representation with an uncertainty metric. The second contribution is to capture uncertainty as data propagates through various query operators. To efficiently quantify result uncertainty of a query operator, this project explores various techniques based on probability and statistical theory to reduce statistics that input streams need to carry and to expedite the computation of result distributions. This project integrates research and education through curriculum development and enables broader participation of women in research through college outreach and CRA's distributed mentor program. This project also includes software release and real-world deployments in domains such as object tracking and monitoring and hazardous weather monitoring, resulting in significant scientific and social impacts.

12533,NSF,NSF,"This research project examines fundamental issues in the current Internet architecture, namely  routable identity , explicit trust/reputation control, and security/privacy considerations for online social networks such as Facebook and SecondLife. It posits a dramatic change in Future Internet/networking design   to facilitate future social communication systems.  The research builds and evaluates this new design, and examines the potential social impacts and insights from it.  The following research objectives are being studied: (1) Can a social peer generate, manipulate and protect all layers of routability toward his/her own identity? (2) How should the notions of trust and reputation be explicitly and formally represented and embedded in a large-scale communication architecture? (Trust/reputation become central in a network architecture based on social identities). (3) What are the trade-offs between the utilization of the social information by the network and the privacy protections needed for it? For evaluation and validation, a social-network based communication system, named Davis Social Links (DSL), is being built, over Facebook, both to mimic the human communication model and to integrate social trust relationships into the network service infrastructure.  Among its benefits, due to the routability design, the DSL architecture will offer a new take on prevention of unwanted traffic (denial of service and so on), a costly and urgent problem in the architecture as it is now.  The DSL project additionally investigates the communication model and its security and safety issues under virtual reality social systems such as SecondLife. The ultimate goal of the DSL project is to study a dynamic, scalable, trust-based, decentralized communication system/architecture for large-scale networks (10 million ~ 10 billion nodes).This multi-disciplinary project is a joint effort among academic researchers and industrial collaborators from computer science, sociology, statistics, and techno-cultural studies. The broader impacts of the research advance potentially both the understanding and the innovation of communication networks. As communications networks exist to support social purposes, the DSL research team carefully examines a number of implications regarding societal relationships and how the Internet user community can directly benefit that relationship."

12596,NSF,HHS,"0754493/0754922 Dabiri and Freund  This project will combine new experimental and computational tools in the design and optimization of biologically-inspired propulsors. For engineering technology to successfully replicate the observed performance of biological systems requires understanding the dynamical role of propulsor flexibility and nonlinear elasticity, characteristics that are ubiquitous in biological propulsion systems. Toward this aim, the PIs will investigate jellyfish swimming as a model system for biological propulsion in general. These animals are a compelling model because they represent one of the simplest examples of a biological propulsor and yet exhibit coupled fluid-structure interactions, large deformations, and nonlinear elasticity. Furthermore, a recently compiled morphological database of over 600 species of jellyfish is available to compare the results of the engineering design optimization with the solutions found in nature. The project objectives are made possible by the recent development of a fully-coupled, two-dimensional, large-deformation, fluid-structure solver that functions within a novel paradigm: material properties and actuation forces are specified instead of propulsor kinematics or inflow boundary conditions. The numerical method will eventually be extended to axisymmetric and three-dimensional configurations. Experimental tools will provide essential new data for validation and refinement of the numerical model, initial inputs to the design optimization, and evaluation of the optimal solutions. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) measurements will be collected both simultaneously and sequentially in multiple planes of the flow field created by free-swimming jellyfish. These data will be evaluated using traditional velocity and vorticity metrics as well as by using new Lagrangian tools from dynamical systems. The collaboration will enable co-design of the experiments and simulations to maximize their mutual utility for understanding biological propulsion and optimizing biologically-inspired engineering designs. A recently developed course on  Biological Propulsion  at Caltech, taught by one of the PIs, will serve as an educational outlet for this research. In order to reach a broader audience, the Illinois group will set up a user-friendly version of the developed code for use in instruction. The Caltech investigator will also continue in his role as Coordinator of the Freshmen Summer Institute (FSI) Research Program at Caltech, which introduces underrepresented incoming freshman to the environment of a research university. Finally, both PIs will mentor undergraduate and graduate students in the day-to-day research activities."
12605,NSF,HHS,"CBET-0828820NeitzelThis research seeks to apply knowledge gained through previous federal support to lab-on-a-chip processing (Bousse, et al. 2000, Whitesides & Stroock 2001). These miniaturized microfluidics devices transport minute liquid samples and reagents from point to point for testing purposes. Typically, such a microfluidics device consists of an array of micro-machined channels or capillaries through which the liquids are forced in a variety of fashions (Stone, et al. 2004). In many 'pumping' strategies, a large pressure difference is created between the ends of an isolated droplet to simply push the droplet through the capillary inversely proportional the capillary radius to the fourth power. The intellectual merits of this work centers on developing and using a novel optical/thermal strategy for droplet transport and mixing using 'permanent nonwetting', using thermocapillary convection to keep liquid samples from contacting solid surfaces, although they are in close proximity. These levitated droplets translate above a solid surface with very low friction, enabling the movement of liquid from point to point with little force, and in shorter time, improving device throughput. Transport of aqueous droplets (of greatest interest for bio-chip applications) will be facilitated by encapsulating the aqueous droplet within immiscible oil. The vigorous internal convection driven by thermocapillarity promotes merging of encapsulated samples as well as mixing of the contents, otherwise difficult with most low-Reynolds-number schemes. The proposed encapsulated-droplet-transport mechanism will also inhibit sample-to-sample contamination. The broader impacts of this research include benefits to the medical-device industry, among others. As part of this research, a partnership has been established with the Fernbank Science Center, a division of the Dekalb County (GA) Board of Education, to develop an ensemble of experiments to stimulate interest in droplet dynamics and fluid physics in secondary school students. These experiments, more than simple demonstrations, require students to collect and analyze data as part of the exercise. The PI will endeavor to promote this exciting research and stimulate minority students to consider graduate study in engineering by giving lectures to undergraduate students in schools of the Atlanta University Center (Morehouse & Spellman Colleges; Clark-Atlanta University)."

The indirect spectroscopic techniques have proven to be successful at finding extra-solar planets and the technology to be developed in this award will permit the spectral line positional changes of the parent star, which infer the existence and mass of a planetary companion, to be measured to significantly higher accuracy than before, thereby extending the technique to lower mass planets. The award will demonstrate that comb lasers can be used for this application and the technology and techniques will be distributed to the general community.  In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will undergo training in instrumentation.  This is a very topical field and the existence of extra-solar planets, especially those resembling the Earth, will capture the public imagination."

The research objectives are to 1) synthesize anisotropic nanoparticles using colloidal directed assembly within GXLs, 2) demonstrate effective methods for the rapid size-fractionation of anisotropic nanoparticles and deposition into uniform, ordered arrays using GXLs, and 3) gain a fundamental understanding of the interparticle interactions and surface forces that govern the synthesis and processing of anisotropic nanoparticles in GXLs.  Previous work has investigated the use of GXLs (low-pressure mixtures of CO2 and organic solvents) and other tunable fluids for the synthesis and processing of ligand-stabilized, spherical metallic nanoparticles.  Here tunable fluids, specifically GXLs, will provide sustainable means for the production of unique nanomaterials for diverse applications.  Gold and silver nanorods in GXLs will be produced by developing a seed-mediated growth processes; coupled with GXL mediated processing to yield uniform nanorod populations and long-range, ordered nanorod arrays.   Advanced characterization techniques and thermodynamic modeling will be employed to gain a fundamental understanding of the anisotropic nanoparticle synthesis and directed assembly to further enhance production and processing capabilities.If successful, this work will advance knowledge in the field of nanomaterial synthesis and manufacture by campaigning two specific philosophies: 1) Sustainable methods of nanoparticle synthesis and processing are achievable and have significant advantages over conventional methodologies for large-scale, economic, and green nanomaterial production.  2) The fundamental driving force for the synthesis of anisotropic nanoparticles is kinetically controlled processes that result from directed assembly rather than conventional colloidal template mechanisms."

12748,NSF,HHS,"Structured hidden databases are widely prevalent on the Web. They provide restricted form-like search interfaces that allow users to execute search queries by specifying desired attribute values of the sought-after tuples, and the system responds by returning a few (e.g., top-k) tuples that satisfy the selection conditions, sorted by a suitable ranking function. Although search interfaces for hidden databases are designed with focused search queries in mind, for certain applications it may be advantageous to infer more aggregated views of the data from the returned results of search queries. Such aggregated information will facilitate learning data distributions or building mining models, which can then be used to power and optimize a multitude of emerging data analytical applications. This research involves developing effective techniques for performing data analytics, especially sampling, over hidden structured databases via their public interfaces. The outcomes include efficient algorithms for sampling hidden databases with a heterogeneous mix of data types, achievability results for sampling different types of search interfaces, and a prototypical toolset which demonstrates the sampling of real-world hidden databases. The ability to pose high-level analytical queries over hidden databases is needed by knowledge workers in a wide variety of corporations, governments, and security agencies.

12836,NSF,HHS,"According to United Nations projections, over half of the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip relies on international humanitarian assistance, and dependency on outside aid continues to rise.  This project provides an innovative examination of the conception, organization, and institutionalization of humanitarian measures in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  It analyzes the role of international humanitarian aid in managing Palestinian displacement and the socio-political effects of prolonged humanitarian relief on the Palestinian refugee population.  In particular, it traces humanitarian policy through a transnational network of coordinated sites from United Nations Headquarters in New York City, to United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Headquarters in Amman, and finally to UNRWA's largest field site in the West Bank -- Balata Refugee Camp.  This research draws from a political geographic framework and employs a mix of archival research, ethnographic methods, and data analysis.  This mixed-method approach allows for in-depth study of UNRWA's humanitarian activities as they are intended by international aid institutions and experienced by aid-recipients. A joint-theoretical approach will be utilized to understand the interplay between discursive and material processes in shaping identity formation, as well as the daily lives and experiences of Palestinian refugees.  Specifically, this project is guided by the following research objectives: (1) to determine how UNRWA's humanitarian policies and projects translate across various geographical scales and cultural contexts into institutional structures and modes of governance in Balata Refugee Camp, and (2) to determine how categorical distinctions instituted by UNRWA ( refugee  and  non-refugee ) intersect with articulations of Palestinian political identity, and assess how Palestinian refugees are negotiating these identities in their everyday lives. This research provides an integrated view of the relationship between humanitarian institutions, aid recipients, and the wider social context within which humanitarian activity is taking place.  Such a study has the potential to highlight critical disjunctures between humanitarian policies as they are intended and conceived by donor institutions and their manifestation on the ground in conflict-zones.  More broadly, this research has the potential to transform the ways in which humanitarian measures are conceptualized and practiced in war-torn societies, especially when this assistance becomes woven into the institutional structures and social fabric of the field site. From this type of assessment, improved humanitarian models, policies and practices can be devised to more effectively align humanitarian activities with the needs of aid recipients, as well as decrease chances that humanitarian measures contribute to or prolong military conflict.  Such research has the potential to advance humanitarian theory and practice and influence international humanitarian policy, both as it relates to the Israel-Palestinian conflict specifically, as well as to war-torn societies more broadly."
12854,NSF,NSF,"The objective of this project is to understand evolutionary principles by which biological networks have acquired their modular architecture, robustness and preservation of diverse functions to sustain life. While much is known about the general rules of natural selection, an analysis of the large-scale properties of networks is necessary to reveal other relevant patterns that emerge through evolution. The difficulty in describing systems in biology, from protein-protein interaction networks to metabolic pathways, on a theoretical level has hampered the development of our understanding of biological networks. The goal of this project is to tackle the theme of emergent phenomena in biological complex networks with novel concepts from non-equilibrium systems and complexity, and to systematically transform these theoretical concepts into practically applicable models of functional modules. In order to achieve this goal, the PI will study functional modules (clusters of proteins cooperating towards achieving a given function) by clustering and renormalization methods. The intellectual merit of this project rests on the unique quantitative methodology, based on the self-similarity measure, developed to elucidate the evolutionary principles embodied at the level of networks of constituent molecules. This novel mathematical scheme will find wide applicability in the newly rising interdisciplinary fields at the interfaces of biology, sociology, and computer sciences. The broader impacts of this project include curriculum development, involvement of underrepresented minority students, and international and interdisciplinary collaborations. Promoting the involvement of minority undergraduate and graduate students in research environments will be a priority of this program. The project will also bring together international leading groups in Complexity and Statistical Physics, Bioinformatics, and Biology."
12888,NSF,NSF,"Accretionary prisms form as sediments are collected (i.e., accreted) and complexly deformed at the down-going edge of a subducting oceanic plate. Accretionary prisms provide evidence of convergence in the geologic record and are a significant mechanism for the growth of continental crust. Some accretionary prisms in subduction zones experience long periods of erosion, rather than accretion, which has led the PIs to propose investigating the triggers for accretion vs. erosion. The Chugach terrane in Alaska has long been considered as a type example of an accretionary prism. The PIs will relate rock-type variations in the accretionary prism to major tectonic events in North America. Structural geology and detrital zircon ages will be used to determine if these variations represent distinct accretionary episodes or a continuum of accretion.  They will study the flysch to constrain its accretionary history using regional geology as a proxy for sediment supply. This project will elucidate processes of subduction erosion that impact general models of geochemical cycling in the Earths interior.  Geologists have long realized that many of the features of the Earth, as well as the causes of natural hazards, are related to the processes by which the large tectonic plates move into the interior of the Earth during subduction.  Subduction leads to volcanism, such as that seen in the Cascades, and subduction caused the largest earthquakes ever recorded, such as in Alaska in 1964. Studying the sediment accreted above the subducting plate will help us understand this subduction process.  In addition, accretionary prisms have the potential to host mineral deposits and could provide a source of methane that would enhance global warming. This project will also help us to understand the history of Alaska and provide for the education of undergraduate and graduate students at minority-serving institutions in the southwest U.S."
12892,NSF,HHS,"Innovations in computing technology, decreasing costs, and advances in miniaturization have made it physically and economically possible to incorporate computers into a wide variety of devices ranging from diminutive wireless sensors to large consumer appliances.

These devices in combination represent a computational fabric which has the potential to enable an ambitious new class of applications that can exploit the resources in the physical world and also affect the environment around them. At present however, devices exist in isolation because their software and hardware architectures are incompatible and they have not been designed with interoperability in mind. This project envisages the design and implementation of a software system that (1) will allow large collections of heterogeneous devices to interoperate via the use of standard interfaces, (2) will enable the representation of a (potentially changing) set of such devices as a single composite device to simplify programming, and (3) will support the construction of complex applications from small modular pieces that run across multiple devices. If successful, the project will achieve a seamless integration of the computing and physical worlds in a manner that is highly sensitive to the needs of individual, groups, and organizations. Intellectual advances associated with the project will be incorporated into the computer science curriculum and will be disseminated as open source software."
12896,NSF,NSF,"Serious new technical challenges are barriers to advances in microelectronics technology as technology scaling comes up against fundamental limits of material properties and lithography. Large process variations and other random performance and power constraining imperfections are now being observed as microelectronic devices are scaled down to atomic dimensions.  This requires that module level performance in electronic designs be pessimistically guardbanded to ensure proper overall system level functionality, forcing systems to operate at performance levels far below the inherent capability of the underlying design fabric.  In addition, embedded DSP systems must be designed to work under worst case operating conditions resulting from ill-conditioned input signals. Wider guardbands from increasing performance and input signal variability in future technologies can negate most of the performance benefits of scaling, stalling a key payoff from Moore?s Law for embedded systems. In  such an environment, introduction of new scaled devices will be cost-effective only if the guardbands can be controlled down to acceptable margins, despite the presence of these uncertainties. This remains a major unsolved challenge, especially for embedded DSP processors that must be concurrently optimized for system level power, performance and reliability. To address these problems, this project is developing the concept of test, diagnosis and continuous signal monitoring enabled dynamic circuit-architecture-algorithm co-modulation (or co-tuning) for both static (procees) and dynamic (input signal) uncertainties. Under this new design paradigm, feedback driven reconfiguration control mechanisms involving circuitry and software (?tuning knobs?) are designed into the IC to support power-performance trade-off and reliability recovery post manufacture. The research pursues vertically integrated circuit-architecture-algorithm tuning methods that offer 10X benefits over optimizations performed at a single level of the design hierarchy. The diagnostic information generated is used to dynamically optimize (post-manufacture) individual module level behavior to optimize system level performance, power and reliability metrics via specially designed hardware and software control mechanisms. In this way, each instantiation of a design adapts to the maximum performance, power, and reliability levels it is capable of in the presence of process variations and adverse operating conditions. Graduate students working on the project receive a unique kind of training in this multidisciplinary research, which together the fields of digital design and test, control systems, embedded digital signal processing architectures, and algorithms. The students participate in summer internship programs with industry. Through joint efforts at Georgia Tech, Auburn University, and Tuskegee University, this project also actively supports the goals of recruiting more U.S. citizens, women and minorities to graduate programs."

The CMPR consists of sites at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of California, San Diego. The proposed center will develop, test and optimize prototype formulations of computationally intensive applications and systems relevant to industry and government partnering sponsors on emerging multicore processors.  The proposed work addresses a real-world problem, and there is a number of processor-intensive computer processes that can benefit immediately from this technology.  The unifying theme uniting these separate research institutions into a Center for Multicore Productivity Research is their synergistic computational research endeavors in multicore computing, available multicore processor resources and the expertise of their staffs to support the computer science inherent in the parallel processing algorithms that are required to optimize the performance and scalability of intensive computations.The broader impact of CMPR addresses the future needs of the computer industry as this new multi core processor technology evolves. Breakthroughs in multi core productivity will enable real-time use of more sophisticated artificial-intelligence based control systems, providing additional productivity savings to multiple manufacturing and process industries. All CMPR sites are incorporating multicore computing into their core course curricula, and CMPR plans to significantly expand the number of industry or government organizations sponsoring relevant student research.  CMPR also plans to capitalize on its relationships with local schools to provide opportunities for high school educators and students to participate in projects at the center.  The collaboration with Maryland public schools and the charter school at UCSD are highly innovative.  The Meyerhoff program and the Georgia Tech interaction with Atlanta area HCBUs should provide an excellent source for research students."
12966,NSF,NSF,"Nurturing Multiplicative Reasoning in Students with Learning Disabilities in a Computerized Conceptual-Modeling Environment (NMRSD-CCME) is a five-year research and development project that will augment teaching practice by providing the tools to analyze student conceptions and enact best-practice on an individual, student-needs basis.  The purpose of this project is to: (a) create a research-based model of how students with learning disabilities (SLDs) develop multiplicative reasoning via reform-oriented pedagogy, (b) convert the model into a computer system that dynamically models every student's evolving conceptions and recommends tasks to promote her/his advancement to higher level, standard-based multiplicative structures and operations, and (c) study how this computerized teaching tool impacts student outcomes, including diminishing the gap between SLDs and their normal achieving peers (NAPs).  The PIs draw upon universal design and three research-based frameworks: machine (or statistical) learning from computer sciences, generalization of word-problem underlying structures (story-grammar) from special education, and a constructivist view of learning from mathematics education. The latter consists of recognizing teaching can promote transformation of students' available mathematical conceptions into intended ones via tasks that orient student reflection on activity-effect relationship and content-specific constructs informed by established research. The development is done in three stages.  The first is a teaching experiment to determine learning trajectories for multiplicative reasoning with SLDs.  The second is the development of a computerized modeling system to support students' construction of multiplicative reasoning (includes alpha, beta and pilot testing).  The final stage is the evaluation of the system by comparing the learning process and outcomes of 15 SLD students with 15 non-SLD to judge the effect of the system on closing the achievement gap. In addition, the effect of the system on SLDs' performance will be compared to the effect of traditional teacher-delivered instruction on SLD. The products include software that is flexible and adaptive to the learner and protocols for teachers.  The project also tests the viability of dynamic recommendation algorithms, which is likely to be important in other domains beyond multiplicative reasoning and with other students who have difficulties learning mathematics concepts."
12976,NSF,HHS,"This project will investigate whether learning in the visual arts, a discipline in which students continually practice visualization, leads to improvements in geometric reasoning. This longitudinal, quasi-experimental study will compare high school students with and without extensive exposure to the visual arts. Geometric reasoning will be assessed at baseline and after one and two years of study, as will visualization skills in art, general spatial visualization, and control tasks not related to visualization. If the study supports the hypothesis that students in the arts group will show greater improvement in their geometric reasoning, future research will examine transfer between visual arts training and other STEM areas that depend on visualization such as physics, chemistry, biology, and additional areas in mathematics. This study promises to extend the boundaries of our understanding of the relation between visual-spatial thinking in mathematics and the visual arts and add to our understanding of the conditions under which near and far transfer may occur. It also has implications for increasing access to higher-level mathematics for students, particularly those students who have traditionally been underserved educationally, by increasing the number of students who succeed in geometry, and thereby increasing the numbers who stay in the mathematical pipeline."
12990,NSF,HHS,"Engineering Other -(59)Microfluidics is a branch of physics and biotechnology that studies the behavior of fluids at the microscale and the design of Micro-Electronic Mechanical Systems (MEMS) that takes advantage of such behavior. Fluids on these small scales behave differently than do fluids at the macro-level because factors such as surface tension, energy dissipation, inertia, and electrokinetics begin to predominate. The objective of this project is to adapt and implement an undergraduate course on microfluidics at partnering institutions.  The course consists of inquiry-based modules supplemented with lectures and reading materials employing educational uses of technology exploring the latest research in microfluidics. The courses will be offered in a variety of engineering programs including the electrical, mechanical, and biomedical disciplines. Students are collaborating on a group project that follows the full-cycle microfluidic system design approach. The course materials are being compiled to produce a textbook on microfluidic theory and practice that is suitable for undergraduate instruction. In addition to the textbook, the results from this project will be disseminated through several engineering education venues."
13002,NSF,HHS,"The mobile phone network is emerging as the largest sensor network on the planet.  Mobile phone users, however, are generally unaware of the dual uses of this network, in which their communication devices are also information gathering devices.  In participatory urban sensing, everyday mobile devices become a platform for coordinated investigation of the environment and human activity.  But transforming phones into data collection instruments raises both technical and ethical challenges.  The PI believes that researchers should utilize this network of sensors with the consent and active participation of users.  Facilitating responsible, socially trusted, and participatory ethics for data collection and analysis with urban sensing systems remains an open problem, and is the challenge undertaken in this research and education project.  In this project, the PI and her team will formalize and qualitatively assess an important test case in participatory ethics: a participatory approach to managing privacy in urban sensing applications.  They will create both an immersion curriculum (using a hands-on laboratory approach) and an interdisciplinary seminar-style curriculum to teach participatory ethics for urban sensing to diverse STEM undergraduate and graduate students, and will evaluate these curricula and synthesize classroom findings into best practices which will then be disseminated for education in participatory urban sensing ethics to urban sensing, ubiquitous computing, and broader technology education communities through white papers, guest lectures, video presentations and discussions, and an active website.Broader Impacts:  This work will benefit many areas of mobile and ubiquitous technology research.  The multidisciplinarity and rapid pace of system development, the social diversity of users, and the diversity of urban sensing applications are exhilirating yet pose significant challenges to developing a participatory ethics framework.  Much as traditional human subjects research guidelines apply to a broad and diverse research scope, the PI believes that similarly powerful principles can be specified for human sensing research.  The pedagogical tools developed in the education phase of this project will train a diverse group of STEM students to align technological advances with human practices and ethics.  Involving students in discussions and practical implementation of participatory ethics will integrate considerations of values into their research and design practice.  Students and researchers trained in participatory urban sensing ethics will design systems that reflect participatory ethics and balance technical and human values.  Students will also bring the ethical thinking and value commitments formed during their education to careers in academia, technology industries, and policy arenas.  As a critical test case in participatory ethics for urban sensing, formalizing and refining participatory privacy regulation will contribute to fields struggling with meaningful privacy design, including mobile and ubiquitous computing, social networking, and web community systems design."
13008,NSF,NSF,"The intimate connection between source coding (data compression,quantization) and simulation (the generation of a signal with prescribed distributions from a purely random mechanism such as coin flips) has been known for over three decades.  Recent results suggest even deeper connections with potentially significant implications for the related problems of compression code design, modeling random processes for the analysis and design of signal processing and coding systems, and understanding the nature and structure of mathematical models of random processes capturing the important properties of signals arising in the real world. This research is concerned with developing precise results characterizing and applying these connections to obtain new insight, theory, and algorithms.In 1977 the performance of an optimized source coding system was shown to be bounded by the quality of a constrained simulation of the source, with equality under certain conditions.  In 2008 this connection was strengthened by a precise formulation and proof of an information theoretic ``folk theorem'' stating that source coding systems performing near the Shannon optimum yield bit streams that are ``nearly coin flips'' in the rigorous sense of closeness in Ornstein's d-bar process distance. Together these results imply that source coding systems --- including digital speech, audio, image, and video communication and storage systems --- and simulation systems --- comprising stationary codings or filterings of iid bits --- are mathematically approximately equivalent systems, and hence the theory and design algorithms appropriate for one yield corresponding results for the other. This project exploits these connections to develop new theory and design algorithms for codes for compression, simulation, and modeling based on known distributions and on distributions learned from data."
13028,NSF,HHS,"Alternative oxidase (AOX) is a heme-independent terminal oxidase present in the respiratory chains of all plants, as well as in certain fungi, protists, animals, and bacteria. Unlike other respiratory oxidases, AOX does not directly contribute to the generation of a proton motive force. With the exception of thermogenic plants, where AOX is used to generate heat during flowering, its function is uncertain, although in eukaryotes it may contribute to metabolic homeostasis, protection from oxidative stress, or virulence.  The role of alternative oxidase in bacterial physiology is unclear.  A recent survey of the sequence databases revealed numerous bacteria and marine metagenomic samples whose genomes encode an AOX-like protein.  A model organism for studying the role of AOX in bacterial physiology is Vibrio fischeri, a bioluminescent marine bacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with the Hawaiian bobtail squid.  In V. fischeri, microarray and reporter assay results have identified a link between aox gene expression levels and nitric oxide (NO).  The overall goal of the research is to investigate the physiological link between AOX and NO.  First, quantitative PCR will be used to assess NO-induced changes in aox transcript levels, and second, the effect of NO on the function of terminal respiratory oxidases in V. fischeri will be investigated.  This work will provide novel information related to the function of AOX in bacterial physiology, an area that is largely unexplored, but has implications for understanding bacterial contribution to marine ecosystems. The studies will provide a foundation for future exploration of the role of AOX in diverse bacteria and ultimately a better understanding of the link between bacterial respiration and ecosystem function. In addition, training opportunities will be provided for one graduate and two undergraduate students in basic microbiological techniques, molecular biology, bacterial physiology, and related instrumentation techniques."
13030,NSF,NSF,"Exurban residential development is widespread, constituting one of the major forms of land-use and land-cover changes in the Eastern US and elsewhere.  This sprawl has large impacts on natural and rural landscapes, ecosystem services, and quality of life for millions of people.  This project investigates the processes linking dynamics of land-atmosphere carbon budgets in exurban residential areas, preferences for land-cover types and patterns on these lands, and land-management activities of residents and developers. The goal of the project is to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationships between carbon dynamics, land-management activities, and market and non-market values of land-uses and land-covers ? focusing on how carbon dynamics might respond in a non-linear fashion to various management and policy options for land-cover management.  Building on the extensive data resources developed under a precursor project, the researchers will use dynamic agent-based models (including a new land-market sub model) to examine a range of exurban land-cover patterns that might be expected to result from market and policy drivers These models will be linked to homeowner preferences and landscape management behaviors from surveys. The outputs of the models will be coupled with a spatially explicit model of biogeochemistry, with inputs derived from remote sensing and field-based sampling within Southeastern Michigan. The researchers will explore the relationship between decision processes by various actors and the resulting changes in biogeochemical processes. We will look for the existence of ecologically significant thresholds (e.g., large, nonlinear land-atmosphere carbon exchange in response to small changes in policy, preferences or behaviors) that are revealed in the coupled system. The study will identify both modeled micro-level dynamics and macro-level patterns in space and time, building on data and model resources developed from previous projects, while creating a complementary new dataset to support modeling of land-market interactions that includes land transactions, biogeochemical processes, cultural preferences and management practices affecting land covers, The complex feedbacks explored in this project, that both drive and result from exurban sprawl, will provide new insights into how policy can be used to guide and manage this landscape change.  Coupled  computer models will be used to evaluate policy scenarios that may be spatially-targeted (e.g., zoning) or aspatial (e.g., carbon credits) and are designed to affect carbon dynamics through mechanisms built on an understanding of the incentives created by markets and preferences and behaviors of residents, developers, and local governments.  Field and modeling work on soil and vegetation carbon dynamics will provide much needed insights into the effects of exurban development on carbon storage, which, given the growth of exurban development, has important implications for the atmospheric carbon budget. The project strengthens scientific capacity and integration by bringing together scientists from a wide range of fields including landscape architecture, ecosystem science, economics, geographic information science, and complex systems science.  The project will produce results that improve our ability to model (a) carbon cycling in the heterogeneous landscapes that humans inhabit, (b) the economic incentives inherent in our management exurban landscapes, and (c) the linkages between peoples? preferences and their behaviors and ecological landscape function.  Models developed for the project will be used to generate both formal and informal educational materials for both graduate and undergraduate instruction on environmental science, policy, and design, in order to improve student understanding of how complex coupled human-environment dynamics can complicate decision making about ecosystem services, and how spatial and dynamic modeling can improve our understanding of alternative options in such settings."
13052,NSF,HHS,"Funding is provided to develop a network of inter-annually resolved proxy records of precipitation from the core monsoon zone of India using the oxygen isotope composition of stalagmites from strategically located caves throughout the core monsoon zone of India.  The ultimate science goal of the research is to develop a composite record of monsoon rainfall variability of the past 2,000 years as a 'paleo-equivalent' of the All India Rainfall time series.  This will serve as a benchmark to assess the variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and to place its 20th century precipitation variability in the context of the past 2,000 years. Additionally, monsoon proxy data sets resulting from this research will be compared to the instrumental and proxy data sets of last 2,000 years to examine variability in coupled atmosphere-ocean modes such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the El Nino- Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  This research will help improve Indian monsoon predictive capabilities on inter-annual to decadal timescales.The broader impacts involve a strong educational mentoring portion and an equally strong intellectual portion.  The proposal supports undergraduate students at a primarily undergraduate-centered institution.  The revised project includes support for a senior thesis.  The science goal of helping to develop a better understanding of the ISM is an important scientific aim in itself but especially since the monsoon system directly and indirectly affects such a large number of people."
13062,NSF,HHS,"It is well known that neritic regions of subtropical oceans experience episodic occurrences of pelagic tunicate blooms. However, little is known regarding the processes that regulate these populations or their ecological significance. Based on sporadic field observations and a relatively small number of laboratory studies, it is understood that theoretically blooms of the Thaliacea, specifically the doliolids, may be particularly important because of their enormous and rapid asexual reproductive capacity. Blooms of over 1,000 zooids m-3 are reported from most of the world's continental shelves. Large blooms of doliolids have the potential of restructuring the trophic structure of shelf pelagic ecosystems by limiting copepod production via consumption of eggs and shunting primary production to the benthos and the microbial loop via fecal production. Although much has been learned via careful laboratory studies, investigation of the processes that govern the development of doliolid blooms cannot be satisfactorily simulated in the laboratory and, until recently, methods to investigate key aspects of trophic interactions between zooplankton, their prey, and their predators in situ have been lacking. In this project the investigators will conduct a field-based study in which classical and proven zooplankton ecology methods will be merged with new molecular based approaches for assessing gut contents to address several fundamental questions concerning doliolid trophic interactions during summer blooms on the South Atlantic Bight continental shelf.Two aspects of the project may be considered potentially transformative. First, it will be among the first to systematically apply zooplankton molecular gut content analytical methods in situ, potentially revolutionizing the field of zooplankton ecology. It is of note that the need for new tools to investigate zooplankton trophic processes has been clearly identified by the science community as a major limitation to the field. Second, the project will explore a paradigm shifting hypothesis that doliolid blooms are controlled not by direct predation, nutrient limitation, or advective oceanographic processes, but by a changing food particle environment.The research focuses on a central theme, trophic interactions, within the diverse field of marine plankton studies, and therefore will be of interest well beyond the specific focus of the project. To a broader degree, the study will serve to help bridge the fundamental divide in modern biology that exists between molecules, organisms, and ecology. An important component of the project will involve training and increasing representation of underrepresented students in STEM fields. One graduate student and three undergraduate students will be supported and trained. Through well established relationships with two Historically Black Universities, both of which have Marine Science programs (Hampton University and Savannah State University), the investigators will aggressively recruit students. Additionally, one of the investigators is a young assistant professor at Hampton University and this project will provide her opportunities to advance her research career, improve research infrastructure at Hampton, and increase student exposure to research. Finally, this project will take advantage of established International relationships with Nordic researchers who are actively engaged in similar research but focused on Appendicularians and other gelatinous pelagic species. The project will also support the participation of US marine scientists in the upcoming Molecular Trophic Interactions II symposium being organized in Savannah in 2009."
13069,NSF,NSF,"The long-term response of large lakes to climate change is not well understood. Recent observational results have shown that winter ice cover plays a vital and previously underappreciated role in determining thermal conditions the following summer; the concentration of high albedo ice determines the timing of the spring overturn, which in turn affects summer temperatures. A long-term trend towards lesser ice cover in Lake Superior is causing a sustained and more effective warming season that is contributing to a rise in summer lake temperatures in significant excess of the rise in air temperature. However, the role that ice plays in this phenomenon and the ability to predict the thermal response of the lake to climate change is poorly understood. In addition, the thermal response of the lake to winter ice cover is critical to its carbon cycle, because temperature is perhaps the single most important determinant of biogeochemical reaction rates. Rates such as nutrient uptake rates by phytoplankton and bacterial respiration rates work in synchrony to regulate the lake carbon cycle. Nevertheless, little is known about what effect steadily rising lake temperatures may have on the long-term stability of biochemical cycles within large lakes. This project will fill in these gaps in knowledge and to gain a fundamental understanding of the role of ice in determining the full annual and interannual cycles of temperature and carbon in large lakes. The following questions that pertain to Lake Superior?s physics and biogeochemistry will be addressed: 1) What is primarily responsible for setting the amount of ice formation? 2) What role does the spatial and temporal variability of ice formation play in determining lake-wide summer conditions? 3) What are the trends in mixed layer depth? 4) Are increased temperatures and reduced ice cover playing a role in the long-term mass balance of the lake, and contributing to the general trend of lower water over the last few decades? 5) How much ?information? regarding heat and carbon, if any, is passed from one year to the next? 6) What is the impact of a progressively earlier ice melt, higher summer temperatures, and stronger thermal stratification on biological production and carbon cycle? The project will improve our understanding of lake levels, a significant factor to the shipping industry. The unprecedented dataset will be available to a variety of lake modelers. Expertise in ice and biogeochemical modeling will also be broadened."
13092,NSF,NSF,"The integrated observing systems that comprise the EarthScope Facility can be used to address fundamental questions at all scales?from the active nucleation zone of earthquakes, to individual faults and volcanoes, to the deformation along the plate boundary, to the structure of the continent and planet. EarthScope data will be openly available to maximize participation from the national and international scientific community and to provide ongoing educational outreach to students and the public.  The intellectual merit of the EarthScope Facility is derived from its link to the support of fundamental research throughout the earth sciences. Through an ambitious data collection scheme and broad geographic coverage, the EarthScope Facility will provide the observational resources to encourage cross-disciplinary investigations and stimulate the next generation of research scientists.  The design and implementation plan for EarthScope was developed through extensive, decade-long engagement with the scientific and educational communities.  Through numerous workshops and working groups, the research community, along with federal and state partners, defined the data and tools required for geoscience to take the next step in exploring the fundamental processes that shape the structure and evolution of our continents. As the MREFC- supported construction stage for the EarthScope Facility nears completion, exciting results are already emerging from the analysis of new EarthScope data, confirming the enhanced resolution provided by this powerful new suite of observational tools.     The broader impacts of EarthScope will be achieved through an integrated education and outreach program and applications in hazard assessment, land use, and resource management. While EarthScope is a national program, it is being operated and maintained at local levels through interactions with hundreds of universities, schools, and organizations across the nation. As EarthScope collects data and makes it available, students and the public will be introduced to key unanswered scientific questions and the role that their region or discipline plays in understanding the evolution of the North American continent and the active processes driving deformation and volcanic activity.  Improved understanding of the natural environment is the first step toward improved land use, environmentally sound development, and resiliency to natural hazards.  With over 3,000 geographical locations, the broad distribution of EarthScope facilities will engage traditionally under-represented groups, particularly students in rural areas that have under-resourced schools and Native Americans on tribal lands (where some of the EarthScope stations will be installed).  EarthScope will provide a unique opportunity for students and the public to observe geological processes in real time and to measure geological change within the time frame of an academic school year.  EarthScope is providing the public with practical examples of how science advances, as they see new data being collected and watch new theories being formulated and tested."

13134,NSF,NSF,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced and phosphorylated forms, NADH, NAD+P and NADPH, are among the most fundamentally important co-enzymes in all living cells.  From the study of NAD+, the nature of cell-free fermentation was demonstrated, functions of co-enzymes in enzyme-mediated transformations were elucidated, vitamins were identified, biosynthetic pathways discovered, and important new mechanisms of gene regulation uncovered.  NAD+ is now recognized not only as a co-enzyme for hydride transfer enzymes but also as a consumed substrate of enzymes found in all three domains of life.  NAD+-consuming enzymes include ADPribose transferases (ARTs), poly(ADPribose) polymerases (PARPs), sirtuins, and cADPribose synthases, which produce nicotinamide plus and an ADPribosyl product in the course of modifying proteins, forming ADPribose polymers, deacetylating protein lysine residues, and cyclizing ADPribose.  Thus, living cells have developed a variety of strategies to salvage NAD+ precursors and to synthesize NAD+ de novo to keep up with the vital demands of hydride transfer enzymes and NAD+ consuming enzymes.  Though many of the most famous vitamin, pathway and enzyme discoveries in the NAD+ field are associated with classic works from 1905 to 1958, a series of creative, original and potentially transformative discoveries in the last 5 years have led to recognition of nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside as additional NAD+ precursors in yeast that are converted to NAD+ via the nicotinamide riboside kinase pathway and also by nucleoside-splitting coupled to nicotinamide and nicotinic acid salvage.  In work that upsets the accepted view of NAD+ metabolism as a stagnant set of long-known reactions, new data indicate that there is a specific transporter for nicotinamide riboside import and there is a novel pathway induced by vitamins and regulated by glucose that breaks down NAD+ to nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside.  Aims:  1) The specific transporter for nicotinamide riboside will be identified and characterized, making use of a novel and general method to determine the copy number of any yeast protein.  2) A novel pathway that degrades NAD+ to nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside will be identified and the mechanism of its regulation by nicotinic acid, nicotinamide and glucose will be determined.  3) A 25 minute family educational experience using baker's yeast to demonstrate basic principals of bioscience will be developed and implemented at the Montshire Museum of Science.  This museum enrichment activity will develop expertise among museum staff, provide bioscience knowledge and encourage inquiry to museum visitors of all ages, and encourage science as a career choice to young, mostly rural, museum visitors.  Scientific Impact:  The function of redox enzymes, sirtuins and ADPribose transfer enzymes depends on import and metabolism of NAD+ precursors, regulation of which is under nutritional and developmental control in all eukaryotes examined.  Discovery and characterization of new, regulated steps in yeast NAD+ metabolism will enlighten the process by which this model eukaryote alters its metabolic biochemistry in response to changing nutritional conditions.  Broader Impact:  Dating back to the characterization of the first enzymes and co-enzymes, yeast has been tremendously important in elucidation of the chemical and biological principles of life.  By developing and implementing a museum-based learning experience on yeast as a living organism, this project will enrich the biology education of rural children, while also showing that graduate students of diverse backgrounds and learning styles make critical contributions to advanced knowledge."
13140,NSF,HHS,"Understanding the mechanisms of speciation allows us to understand how biological diversity has been generated in nature. This research will unravel the genetics of speciation by studying populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus. This species is an excellent model system in which to study the early stages of reproductive isolation, because it has populations that are dramatically genetically differentiated but can be crossed in the lab. Thus, they show only partial reproductive isolation and speciation is not yet complete. Two specific genetic systems will be examined, both of which play central roles in metabolism and energy generation in animals. The study will probe how interactions between genes can reduce fitness in hybrids and contribute to reproductive isolation. Understanding the genetic basis of reproductive isolation in Tigriopus contributes to understanding of speciation in general and improves understanding of the mechanisms by which interactions between proteins can change between diverging groups. The research includes both graduate and undergraduate training and will seek to involve underrepresented groups and females in the research process."
13213,NSF,NSF,"Collaborative Research:A Mathematical Framework for the Performance Evaluation of Large-Scale Sensor NetworksJeffrey P. Kharoufeh and Rusty O. Baldwin This grant provides funding for creating and analyzing mathematical models of large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs).  A WSN is a collection of sensing devices linked via a wireless transmission medium for the purpose of sensing and conveying information about objects, their surroundings, and their interactions, without human intervention.  When the information is time sensitive, the network?s performance capabilities are critical to meeting quality-of-service guarantees. However, assessing network performance is difficult because the location of the data is generally not known a priori, or it may not exist in the network at all, sensors have limited energy reserves and fail when these reserves are exhausted, sensors may fail due a harsh operating environment, and communication channel quality may vary with time, impacting the timely delivery of critical data.  These characteristics distinguish sensor networks from other communication networks and significantly complicate the task of modeling and predicting their performance over time.  If successful, the results of this research will lead to fundamental principles, effective algorithms and optimization schemes that will enhance the design, analysis, control and realization of WSNs.  Using a queueing network-based model, specific performance parameters will be investigated including the network energy expenditure, average time required to respond to queries and the query success rate (the proportion of queries that are answered on time).  The sensitivity of the network?s performance to query deadline distributions, sensor failures and the network?s environment will also be assessed.  Finally, optimization of the network?s parameters will be investigated to ensure resilience in various operating environments."

The AccessComputing alliance engages individuals with disabilities as well as those who support, serve, guide, educate, and employ them. Specifically, this extension will  (1) increase the capacity of postsecondary institutions, precollege educators, veterans associations, other projects that broaden participation in computing, and industry to fully include individuals with disabilities in computing fields; (2) create synergistic and lasting relationships among stakeholders to foster systemic changes toward inclusiveness in computing education and careers; (3) implement evidence-based practices (e.g., mentoring, internships) to increase the number of individuals with disabilities moving through critical junctures to computing careers; and (4)  expand an online resource center to share research and promising practices worldwide. Applying methods grounded in multidisciplinary knowledge management, collaboration, and social network theory and practice, the AccessComputing Extension will formalize earlier and new relationships into a multi-tier organizational structure of partners, collaborators, and affiliates. Outcomes for individuals with disabilities will be documented by tracking the progress of student participants as well as institutional enrollment and graduation data; results will be compared to local, regional, and national data with respect to the academic and career success of people with disabilities."
13310,NSF,HHS,"TechnicalThe late 20th century marked a renaissance in fundamental areas of tribology, sparked by new experimental and theoretical techniques capable of studying the force of friction in geometries which are well defined at the atomic scale. This project involves the use of one such technique, namely the Quartz Crystal Microbalance, to probe critical topics in this field.  A first set of experiments will explore how friction impacts directed transport of polystyrene microspheres, to document control of motion through variations in atomic-scale friction levels. The second involves studies of the impact of sliding on the two-dimensional melting point of monolayer thick Krypton layers, important for fundamental studies of temperature rise and heat transport.  The final set of experiments will document the manner in which magnetic fields influence the firmly established, yet still poorly understood phenomenon of superconductivity-dependent friction, for helium and oxygen films. The goal is to deepen our knowledge of electronic contributions to energy dissipation mechanisms in sliding friction. A complimentary educational component includes (1) ongoing participation of undergraduates in the research, and (2) direct dissemination of state-of-the-art information on friction to instructors developing curriculum on the topic, as well as to more general audiences through lectures and written reviews.Non-TechnicalBy most recent estimates, improved attention to friction and wear would save developed countries up to 1.6% of their gross national product, well over $100 billion annually in the U.S. alone. As the price of energy rises, and the need to conserve both energy and raw materials becomes increasingly urgent, physicists' rush to understand basic tribological processes can only be expected to accelerate. The late 20th century marked a renaissance in fundamental areas of tribology (the study of friction and wear), sparked by a number of new experimental and theoretical techniques capable of studying the force of friction in geometries which were are well-defined at the nanometer scale. This project involves the use of one such technique, namely the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM), (1) to explore the role of friction to control micron scale particles, an important feature in emerging nano-technological areas that include medical, electronic and manufacturing applications, (2) to probe the temperature of a simplified sliding contact, a quantity that has been exceptionally difficult to quantify from theoretical, experimental and computational approaches, and  (3) to explore the firmly established, yet still poorly understood phenomenon of superconductivity-dependent friction. The goal is to deepen our fundamental knowledge of how electrons contribute to energy loss.

13311,NSF,HHS,"This project will build a  Scientific Observations Network --as a multi-disciplinary, community-driven effort to define and develop a unified model for observational data, to enhance data sharing, merging and reuse in the earth and life sciences. This effort will coordinate work of a community of experts drawn from numerous disciplines, including ecology, hydrology, oceanography, geo-sciences, the geospatial community, and life sciences, working closely with computer scientists and information managers, to develop necessary specifications and technologies to facilitate intelligent interpretation and seamless integration of observational data. Advances in environmental science and ecology increasingly depend on information from multiple disciplines to address broad, complex questions about the natural world. Researchers are extremely challenged, however, in effectively locating, interpreting, and integrating data that might be relevant for these investigations. This is due to extreme variability in the structure and contents of the data that scientists collect. This project will support the growing interest in the earth and life sciences in the possibilities of describing data at the level of observation and measurement, rather than the traditional focus at the level of the data set, in order to achieve stronger data discovery and interoperability. The Scientific Observations Network will work to develop compatible, open-source, standards-based approaches to the semantic modeling of observational data. A key goal will be the development of a core conceptual data model for representing scientific observations. This core observations model will provide a common basis for developing, extending, and applying highly specialized scientific terminologies required for detailed descriptions of data relevant for environmental research. Subgroups of experts will engage in extending the core data model to include a broad range of specific measurements collected by the representative disciplines, and a series of demonstration projects will illustrate the capabilities of these approaches to confederate data for reuse in broader and unanticipated contexts. The scientific Observations Network will help to insure that scientific data, once collected, is put to the greatest possible use by the broadest group of users."
13314,NSF,NSF,"Daniel Neuhauser of UCLA is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for work to develop a theoretical methodology to understand molecular nanopolaritonics.  The project is intended to unify the treatment of radiation and matter in such a way as to efficiently and accurately describe systems of arbitrary physical geometry and electronic structure. Prior to this reseach, combined plasmon-matter studies typically utilized multipole mode expansions on the plasmon-carrying structure, which although simple, are unable to accurately capture arbitrary geometries or field singularities. Using TDDFT for the whole system, on the other hand, is prohibitively expensive computationally.  The PI is, thus, extending previous simulations, both in terms of method used and applications chosen for testing those methods.  The research starts with FDTD-type algorithms (to be modified for near-field applications), and continues on to discrete-dipole studies, and finally implements embedding formalisms using Hydrodynamic Tensor DFT. The molecular part is being described by a real-time TDDFT algorithm, and treated non-linearly as to capture the multiharmonic and frequency mixing characteristics of the system.The drive towards ever smaller scales for radiation features has led to the new field of plasmonics in which light transport along metal nanoparticle arrays and waveguides is studied at distances as small as a few nanometers (nm). At the same time, electronic structure calculations have also reached the nm size scale, so that the distinction between radiation and matter scale is being blurred out. This has led to a variety of studies where dipolar emission coupling of a few plasmons and excitons are considered, with interesting resonance, field- and spatial-dependence and more. Matter-radiation on the nanoscale (nanopolaritonics in short) is now ripe for a realistic description of both near-field radiation and molecules. The PI and his group are merging Maxwell's near-field description with modern studies of electronic dynamics, to simulate combined matter-radiation (plasmon-exciton, i.e., polariton) systems on the nanoscale. Some applications being considered are: gating of radiation transfer, specifically in large scale plasmonic systems with birefringence effects, including questions about whether molecules can control these systems, an application with possible use in imaging; nonlinear selective microscopy on the nanoscale -- a field with potentially huge impact for sensing applications from engineering to medicine; conversion of electromagnetic near-field energy to physical motion on the nanoscale, which will have practical importance in any field requiring motion control; photovoltaics where plasmons are hoped to reduce absorber sizes; matching of near and far fields, which could conceivably be affected by molecular motion; and the development of plasmon logic circuits ."
13325,NSF,NSF,"This research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program at NSF supports work by Professor Jeffrey Rack at Ohio University to investigate a new class of transition metal complexes that change structure and color when exposed to solar radiation (light). The emphasis of the study is the synthesis and complete characterization of photochromic ruthenium and osmium complexes, whose mode of action is associated with sulfur-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-sulfur isomerization of sulfoxide ligands bound to the metal in these chromophoric complexes. These studies will focus on discovering the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the action of this unique family of chromophores that utilize light to break and make bonds on a very fast timescale. Members of this new class of transition metal complexes will be employed in the fabrication of solar-driven nanoscale devices for information storage applications. Thus, both fundamental and applied aspects of this chemistry will be explored. Students associated with this project will be involved in a variety of outreach programs that engage male and female students from local area schools in chronically economically depressed Appalachia (Athens, OH).  The development of light-activated compounds and materials is important for both laboratory and industrial settings. The transduction of light energy to other forms of energy is of intrinsic interest and relevance in biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering. These molecules and these studies will reveal new strategies for the conversion of light energy into other forms of energy."
13330,NSF,NSF,"AbstractAntarctic notothenioid fishes have evolved in the Southern Ocean for 10-14 MY under an unusual set of circumstances. Their characteristics include the complete absence of the circulating oxygen-binding protein, hemoglobin (Hb) within the Channichthyid (Icefish) family of notothenioids. Moreover, some species within the 16 members of this family have also lost the ability to express the oxygen-binding and storage protein, myoglobin (Mb) in cardiac muscle.  Our previous work has determined that the loss of Hb and/or Mb is correlated with significant increases in densities of mitochondria within oxidative tissues, and extensive remodeling of these vital organelles. To date, nothing is known about how modifications in mitochondrial architecture of icefishes affect organelle function, or more importantly, how they affect organismal-level physiology. Most critical for Antarctic fishes is that mitochondrial characteristics have been linked to how well ectotherms can withstand increases in temperature. This collaborative research project will address the hypothesis that the unusual mitochondrial architecture of Antarctic Channichthyids has led to changes in function that impact their ability to withstand elevations in temperature. Specifically, the research will (1) determine if the unusual mitochondrial architecture of icefishes affects function and contributes to organismal thermal sensitivity, (2) identify differences in organismal thermal tolerance between red- and white- blooded notothenioids, (3) identify molecular mechanisms regulating changes in mitochondrial structure in icefishes. The results may establish channichthyid icefishes as a sentinel taxon for signaling the impact of global warming on the Southern Ocean. Broad impacts of this project will be realized by participation of high school biology teachers in field work through cooperation with the ARMADA project at the University of Rhode Island, as well as graduate education."

The overall goal of this project is to increase the awareness, motivation and self-perception of Arizona students in their formative middle school years to engineering opportunities and educational pathways that lead to successful engineering careers. In doing so, the State of Arizona will have in place a more socially-embedded comprehensive and effective educational pipeline that will provide the needed Arizona engineering workforce to compete in a global competitive high technology economy.

13360,NSF,NSF,"CBET-0833953Rowe Objectives: The use of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in commercially available products is rapidly increasing. There is, however, a dearth of information regarding the potential toxicity of these NPs to humans and the environment. In addition, because of their unique properties, some NPs have toxicity characteristics that are different from larger forms of the same material. This has prompted scientific journals, independent governmental reviews, and the popular press to call for a rapid and cost-effective method to determine NP toxicity. Current nanotoxicity tests utilize vertebrate systems that are expensive to maintain, have long data generation timescales, and do not address the potential of NPs to differentially affect different organisms. Here we propose a rapid, cost effective approach to determine the toxicity of manufactured NPs in a range of model systems.Approach: We propose to determine the toxicity of well-characterized NPs that are commercially available or produced at University of Dayton. Using a three-pronged approach we will 1) determine the toxicity of NPs to ecologically- and economically-important bacteria, 2) assess the acute and multi-generational effects of NP exposure using Drosophila melanogaster, and 3) determine the cellular fate of NPs and tease apart the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of NP exposure to mammalian cell lines.Expected results: The results of this project will fill a much-publicized void in information pertaining to the potentially toxic effects of manufactured NPs. These data will elucidate the cellular fate of NPs upon exposure to living organisms and determine the organismal level response to this exposure in different organisms. The increase in toxicity information generated by this proposal will greatly enhance the assessment of risk associated with products containing engineered NPs, and will improve consumer confidence in a technology that is estimated to surpass the impact of the industrial revolution.Supplemental keywords: Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, K12, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEF, mouse embryonic stem cells, MES,"

13414,NSF,HHS,"We are entering an Industrial Revolution in the production of information. While in the past data was  handmade  by typing on keyboards, today data are increasingly manufactured by machines: sensors, cameras, software logs, etc. When harnessed in a timely manner, these data can have significant positive impact in many contexts, including early warning and rapid response in natural disasters, air quality monitoring, and improved Internet security. To provide useful information in these contexts, computers in multiple locations must coordinate over networks, because the data are both widely distributed and massive, and cannot be  warehoused  at a single location in a timely manner. Worse, sensor data is typical  noisy  or erroneous in various ways, so statistical methods must be employed to convert the raw  evidence  data into probabilistically reliable information. In this project we develop new techniques to integrate statistical inference methods from AI with overlay network algorithms developed for peer-to-peer and wireless settings. We design new overlay network algorithms customized for distributed inference. We also develop network-aware inference algorithms that can trade off inference approximation quality for communication efficiency and robustness to network failure. Finally, we explore the use of a high-level declarative language for programming both the networking and inference logic. The high-level language enables us to investigate compilation techniques to co-optimize the inference and overlay network tasks for maximal utility. We prototype and evaluate our ideas via open-source implementations deployed on testbeds like Emulab and Planetlab. Software and research papers are disseminated at http://declarativity.net."

13500,NSF,NSF,"The Himalaya and Tibet stand as the type example of a continent-continent collision, thus the Indo-Asian orogen serves as a paradigm for collisional orogenesis and a testing ground for tectonic models. One overriding tectonic issue is what controls the structural evolution of an orogen. Classic models of thrust development (the critical taper model) do not preclude weak portions of the crust but suggest that these do not work in concert to induce flow; in contrast recent thermal-mechanical models (channel flow models) treat the middle and lower crust as profoundly weak and in concert with erosion dominate metamorphic and structural development. This project, carried out by researchers from the University of Alabama and Boise State University in collaboration with scientists at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, aims to discriminate between these two opposing views by exploiting the radically different pressure-temperature-time kinematic histories predicted by these models. Specifically, the team will carry out integrated structural, petrologic, stratigraphic, and geochronologic investigations in the Himachal-Uttaranchal in northwestern India to address three basic questions regarding Himalayan thrust transport and tectonic evolution: (1) How do stratigraphic and structural packages correlate along strike from Nepal? Field mapping and structural analysis will permit stratigraphic correlations from Nepal to India and define thrust geometries and shortening amounts via balanced cross sections. Thin section, Nd isotope, and detrital zircon analysis will help define major lithotectonic units, which is critical to accurate placement of different thrust sheets. (2) What was the pressure-temperature-time evolution of the major Himalayan thrusts? Petrologic and chronologic characterization of monazite grains via electron and ion microprobes will be related to the temperature-time evolution of each rock, yielding timing of thrust movement and rates of heating and cooling. New more accurate and precise trace element thermometers are use to determine peak pressure-temperature conditions and distributions and paths. (3) How does the kinematic history in Himachal-Uttaranchal compare with Nepal? The main purpose of this research is to address a fundamental and controversial question in modern tectonics: Is the overall behavior of the crust during mountain building better explained by the critical taper model or the more recent channel flow model. The critical taper theory argues that a wedge-shaped mass of deformed rocks develops in front of a rigid backstop resulting in forward propagating thrust faults. The channel flow model argues that focused erosion at the mountain range front forces deformation in a weak channel in the mid- to lower crust and partially molten rocks tunnel toward the mountain front. This project also support the research education of graduate and undergraduate students, fosters improved scientific collaborations among institutions both within the United States and in India, and supports an underrepresented group among the geosciences professoriate."
13540,NSF,HHS,"Scalable Parallel Algorithms for Partial Differential EquationsAbstractScalable algorithms for partial differential equations play a key role in Computational Science and Engineering. As the number of processors in today's supercomputers grows rapidly, scalability becomes one of the most important issues in algorithm design. Tremendous progress has been made in this research area in the past few years. The conference brings together experts in this field from all over the world to discuss the latest development of scalable algorithms, and to introduce junior researchers to this exciting research field. The conference also supports the participation of graduate students and provides them with a unique opportunity for exposing their research to a large audience and for learning from experts.The primary focus is on domain decomposition METHODS which COMPRISE by far the most common scalable paradigm for large-scale simulation on massively parallel distributed, hierarchical memory computers. In domain decomposition, a large problem is reduced to a collection of smaller problems, each of which is easier to solve computationally than the un-decomposed problem, and most or all of which can be solved independently and concurrently. Typically, it is necessary to iterate over the collection of smaller problems, and much of the theoretical interest in domain decomposition algorithms lies in ensuring that the number of iterations required is very small. Indeed, the best domain decomposition methods share with their cousins, multigrid methods, the property that the total computational work is linearly proportional to the size of the input data, or that the number of iterations required is at most logarithmic in the number of degrees of freedom of individual subdomains. Algorithms whose work requirements are linear in the size of the input data in this context are said to be optimal. Optimal domain decomposition algorithms are now known for many, but certainly not all, important classes of problems that arise in science and engineering. Much of the current research interest in domain decomposition algorithms lies in extending the classes of problems for which optimal algorithms are known. Domain decomposition algorithms can be tailored to the properties of the physical system as reflected in the mathematical operators, the number of processors available, and even to specific architectural parameters, such as cache size and the ratio of memory bandwidth to floating point processing rate."

13579,NSF,NSF,"Forest soils contain more carbon than the entire atmosphere and thus the exchange of carbon dioxide between forest soils and the atmosphere can influence the global carbon cycle and climate change.  Changes taking place in forests today, including shifts in the identity of dominant tree species and exotic earthworm species invasions, threaten to perturb the carbon balance of these ecosystems.  Unfortunately, the effect of these two disturbances on forest soil carbon storage is largely unknown.  The intent of this proposal is to study the influence of tree species and earthworms on soil carbon storage at a unique field experiment in Poland, where 14 different tree species were planted more than 35 years ago.  At this site, tree species are known to differ with respect to the earthworm populations they support and other qualities that could influence soil carbon, including leaf and fine root characteristics.  The research put forth in this proposal will relate these known species differences to new studies of soil carbon dynamics using advanced molecular and isotopic analytical tools.  By defining clear relationships between tree species, earthworms, and soil carbon storage, the consequences of changing tree species composition and earthworm invasions on the carbon balance of forests can be better understood.  This information could be used to manage the species composition of U.S. forests for the purpose of carbon sequestration, facilitating participation in economic and political pursuits aimed at carbon management and climate change mitigation."

Many scholars have argued that the end of discrimination against particular groups was caused by the global triumph of political liberalism and that powerful exemplars of liberal democracy shaped the policies of countries in their sphere of influence. And yet, if liberalism is incompatible with racism, why were the United States and Canada leaders in the spread of racialized policy restrictions in the Americas during the early twentieth century? Why did authoritarian Latin American regimes remove negative racial discrimination from their immigration laws around World War II, a generation before liberal-democratic states like the United States and Canada did the same in the 1960s? This study will answer those questions by creating an original database of racial and national origin preferences in the immigration and citizenship laws of 22 major countries of the Americas since 1850. A statistical analysis of time series data will test the extent to which specific political, demographic, and economic conditions explain levels of racialization in those policies. The quantitative analysis will be complemented by case studies based on archival materials and the secondary literature of the five primary countries of immigration ? the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba ? and Mexico as a negative instance of a country that sought, but failed to attract mass immigration.The intellectual merit of this project lies in (a) its cross-country comparisons and long time frame, and (b) a research strategy of using case-studies to address the puzzles and gaps that emerge from quantitative analyses. The systemic long-view proposed is potentially transformative because it shows how the internal inclusiveness of liberal democracy often rests on categorical exclusions of outsiders. The study?s broader impacts will include (1) lessons for contemporary immigration policy (whether the current stance against racist exclusion is historically contingent and thus reversible, how egalitarian laws may in practice discriminate by race, and if racialist exclusions may be giving way to more politically palatable, but still discriminatory categorical distinctions); (2) using an inquiry-based approach to train underrepresented students in a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies; (3) the integration of project data into the undergraduate curriculum and research mentorship, and the provision of research apprenticeships for graduate students. In addition, (4) findings will be disseminated to a wide audience of academics, policymakers, and other stakeholders through workshops, conference presentations, and publication of original data and results in high-profile Internet sites and academic publications. Finally, (5) it fosters collaboration across disciplines (sociology and economics) and types of research and teaching institutions (UC San Diego and Grinnell College) by, among other things, developing appropriate sharing technologies."
13653,NSF,NSF,"With the recent emergence of many severe human diseases (e.g., West Nile, SARS, Hantavirus), it has become increasingly important to understand the factors that determine whether pathogens evolve to become virulent or benign. The conventional wisdom states that a pathogen should always evolve towards a benign coexistence with its host. However, there is substantial evidence that pathogens sometimes evolve to cause severe disease, suggesting that high virulence may be advantageous in some cases. This is referred to as virulence trade-offs. In this project the fish virus IHNV and its rainbow trout host will be used to explore the evolution of virulence. Virus strains that differ in virulence will be tested in a novel system for quantifying viral fitness during infection in living juvenile trout. Results will be used to develop a population-scale model that will identify factors predicted to lead to increased virulence. Finally, the model predictions will be tested by comparing virulence of virus field strains that occur in different environments.The evolution of pathogen virulence has become a major field of investigation and numerous theoretical models have been developed invoking virulence trade-offs.  Progress in this field is hampered by a general lack of experimental data, particularly in vertebrate host-pathogen systems. In this project a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches will provide novel information on the existence and nature of virulence tradeoffs, enhancing our understanding of how important veterinary and human diseases emerge.

The desired result is to help PhD candidates make contact with cutting edge research, to see that their work can have broad appeal, and to encourage them to make their research accessible to those in other fields who could benefit from their work. As this workshop is designed around training graduates students in the HPS of genetics, one primary goal of this workshop is to create an environment where graduate students can feel comfortable participating as full members of the academic community. The organizers promote the use of  happy office hours  wherein faculty members make themselves available at a specific time and location such as a coffeehouse, restaurant, or classroom for students to drop in and make informal contacts or discuss research ideas. This effectively creates lots of time for interaction between student and faculty researchers for thinking together. In addition, the organizers are actively recruiting speakers from underrepresented groups, especially women. The inclusion of neuroscientists and psychologists in discussions with members of the HPS community promises an expansion of disciplines including new topics for discussion and new lines of research."
13767,NSF,NSF,"This effort will test the hypothesis that the loss of arctic sea ice and northern high latitude snow cover will invoke changes in the seasonality, spatial distribution and magnitudes of precipitation (P) and net precipitation (P-E) over the Arctic, which along with attendant changes in temperature, have ramifications for the freshwater budget of the Arctic Ocean and the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet.The researchers expect that: (a) sea ice loss will lead to an increase in available water vapor over the Arctic Ocean and peripheral seas, most pronounced in autumn and winter, when delayed ice formation and thinner ice will promote large vertical fluxes of heat and moisture into the atmosphere; (b) loss of sea ice and terrestrial snow cover will invoke changes in arctic circulation patterns and hence patterns of water vapor convergence, driven in autumn and winter by enhanced vertical heat fluxes and during the warm season by altered differential heating over the Arctic Ocean and surrounding land; (c) in lying  downwind  of the Arctic Ocean as well as adjacent to the (presently) partially ice-covered East Greenland Sea and Baffin Bay, the Greenland ice sheet will feel these changes both through impacts on accumulation and surface melt.The analysis tool will be Polar WRF, a recently developed regional climate model optimized for polar applications. Control simulations will be conducted for several arctic domains, focusing on recent years which are characterized by extremely low September sea ice extent, with lateral forcing supplied from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, and sea ice conditions prescribed from satellite-based observations. Generated fields of key hydrologic variables (precipitable water, precipitation, vapor flux convergence, net precipitation, temperature) and atmospheric circulation will be contrasted with those from a series of experiments with altered sea ice and snow cover. These will include simulations with climatological maximum winter ice extent and concentration through the annual cycle, prescribed reductions in ice extent and concentration larger than those observed, 100% and 0% terrestrial snow cover maintained over the annual cycle but with observed sea ice conditions, and observed sea ice conditions but with increased sea surface temperature over open water areas in summer."
13769,NSF,HHS,"SES-0802654Harvey MolotchJane JonesNew York UniversityThe discourse on wealth generally does not include African Americans (blacks), but does mention their lack of wealth. Conversely, the literature on race, particularly in regard to African Americans, has only recently come to include a substantive discussion of black members of the middle and upper middle classes.  This research is a sociological study of race, as well as class status and focuses on philanthropic practices amongst the black elite. There are two main questions that organize this project. First, what is the relationship between philanthropy and the social organization of the black elite? Second, what meanings and motivations do black donors bring to the practice of philanthropy? The first question lends itself to a group level analysis, while the second question requires an individual level analysis.  By conducting interviews with elite black donors in New York City, this study will evaluate how class and race interact in ways that influence black elites? subjectivity and identity.  The unique intersection of racial oppression and class privilege at which the black elite are socially located produces an experiential knowledge that informs the practices of this group. Broader Impacts: The broader implications of this work are both scholarly and practical. Empirically, this project opens up a new population to be studied ? the black elite. Theoretically, it bridges intersectionality theory and studies of power and privilege by looking at the consolidation of power within a marginalized group. More broadly, practitioners interested in developing relationships with African American donors will find this work useful. One broad implication of the changing nature of philanthropy is that African Americans will become a ?niche market? of sorts for fundraisers. If this is the case, then this study?s portrait of the patterns of giving among black elite philanthropists will be a useful guide. As society increasingly looks to the private sector for solutions to social inequality, the role of philanthropists will become even more important. Determining what types of organizations that black elites support, and why they do so, will provide useful knowledge about black elites? position in the philanthropic field"
13881,NSF,HHS,"CBET-0828903M. Plesniak, Purdue UniversityUnder this grant, modeling assumptions that are commonly applied in models of human phonation (fluid-induced vibrations of the vocal folds) will be systematically evaluated.  Because of the inaccessibility of the larynx, modeling has long been a primary component of voice research.  Speech models seek to simplify the complicated fluid-structure interactions of human voice production while still capturing the relevant physics.  However, untested modeling assumptions limit the accuracy of such models.  Ultimately, highly accurate models will be transformative to clinical diagnosis, treatment, and pre-surgical planning of voice disorders.  The prevalence of voice disorders in the general population is estimated to be as high as 30%, and is twice as high among professionals who lecture regularly, such as educators.  Each year, billions of dollars in lost productivity costs is due to vocal ailments. The goal of this project is to assess the validity of untested modeling assumptions that are routinely employed.  Fluid flow investigations will be performed in a 7.5 times life-size controllable dynamic model of the vocal folds.  Viscous flow phenomena within the glottis will be studied via spatial and temporal flow field data using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV).  Parametric structural analysis will be performed to determine the sensitivity of the vocal fold structure to eight geometric and six tissue parameters of several have never been measured.  The knowledge obtained from this study will increase the accuracy and validity of future models, eventually leading to the creation of clinically relevant models of human speech.  In addition to speech production, the results will be relevant to the more general fields of fluid-structure interactions, and biomedical engineering.The existing outreach programs at Purdue University will ensure that in addition to engineering and societal impacts, the research will have a broader impact on participation of underrepresented groups, undergraduate research participation, and K-12 outreach programs.  The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at Purdue University facilitates meaningful guided research for undergraduate students, in which female and minority participation is especially encouraged by Purdue's Minority Engineering organization.  Participation in engineering outreach programs such as  Imagination Station ,  Middle School Minds , and EPICS at Purdue University will facilitate the exposure of K-12 students to the excitement of engineering at a young age.  A functional model of the human speech process created in conjunction with EPICS will be used for instruction in undergraduate Speech Language and Hearing Research (SLHS) classes."
13889,NSF,HHS,"Hormones integrate behavior and physiology by responding to environmental signals and altering gene expression in target tissues in the brain and the body.  However, when the environment of a species changes, the most adaptive response might be to lose hormone sensitivity at some of the target tissues.  An open question is whether hormone-mediated traits can be decoupled in such a way.  This research will focus on the steroid hormone testosterone and its integrating effect on the behavior and physiology of males and females of a songbird species, the dark-eyed junco.  The relative importance of phenotypic integration or independence of hormonally mediated traits has significant implications for the evolution of life histories, sex differences, and the formation of new species.The research will help to train future scientists of diverse backgrounds in the conduct of laboratory and field research that combines techniques and perspectives from multiple disciplines.  Potential societal implications of the research include greater knowledge of the impact of hormonally active agents in the environment, and the ability of natural populations to respond effectively to environments altered by climate change."

13942,NSF,NSF,"Objective: This proposal seeks to study adiabatic wavelength conversion in active optical resonators, providing a rich research opportunity for two PhD students while expanding fundamental knowledge of the behavior of light.Intellectual Merit: Adiabatic wavelength conversion is a relatively unexplored area of optical physics that is expanding fundamental knowledge of the behavior of light and presenting new solutions for photonic routing, data management, signal processing, and pulse-shape control. Previous research is limited in the magnitude of wavelength change because it employed passive optical resonators with short photon lifetimes. The proposed research will make use of active optical resonators (resonators with gain) that exhibit much longer photon lifetimes and thus a larger magnitude of wavelength change. Theoretical investigations will model aspects such as gain saturation and spontaneous emission, and will be complemented by experimental studies in active Indium Phosphide resonators. This semiconductor platform allows control of wavelength conversion via auxiliary optical pulses having sub-milliwatt powers and telecommunication wavelengths.Broader Impact: The proposed activity will provide a rich theoretical and experimental research experience for two Ph. D. students and will train them in an area of national importance; equal opportunity will be given to interested female and minority candidates in the tradition of the University of Rochester. Emphasis will be placed on communicating research findings to the global scientific community through peer-reviewed journal papers and major international conferences. Results will also be integrated directly into graduate and undergraduate courses on optoelectronics and lightwave technology at The Institute of Optics."
13950,NSF,NSF,"A major deviation from the classical model of translation occurs for those mRNAs that lack a cap structure. These mRNAs possess a structured, non-coding region of 5' RNA known as an IRES (internal ribosome entry site). IRES are also beginning to be identified in cellular RNA.  Generally, they are found under conditions where overall translation is compromised.  The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of viral mRNA is sufficient to confer its cap-independent translation, however the mechanism of IRES translation (including viral translation) is not well understood.  This project will elucidate the mechanisms of IRES function by using the 5' UTR of tobacco etch virus (TEV) as a model system. The TEV 5' UTR secondary structure has been mapped by chemical probing and mutagenesis. Three inter-related phases of the initiation process will be examined. These are 1) eIF binding, 2) helicase activity and 3) ribosome binding activity. Each of these activities will be measured for a select library of TEV constructs with differing translational activity. The eIF binding will be monitored by direct fluorescence assays. Base pairing changes associated with helicase activity will be elucidated by using fluorescent labels incorporated into specific locations in the RNA and nmr measurements. Ribosome binding will be measured by direct fluorescence methods and sucrose gradient analysis. The experiments described here will elucidate the molecular interactions that allow viral IRES to compete effectively with the much higher concentrations of cellular RNA for translation.  Plant viral diseases affect a significant number of food crops world-wide and can have severe impact both on economic conditions and food supply. There is potential to use information from this research not only to control viruses but also to develop systems to produce desired proteins which are nutritionally beneficial, antibodies or have economic uses. TEV is one of the simplest IRES elements, so it serves as a model system to increase our understanding of more complex viral and cellular IRES function. The experiments will provide excellent training for students from high school through graduate school in both biochemical and quantitative measurements. Many of the students involved in research in the past have been from underrepresented minority groups and this is likely to continue in the future. These students will contribute to a diverse and well trained workforce in science and technology."
13990,NSF,NSF,"This is an SGER award which will take advantage of dynamite explosions during a previously funded CD project (the High Lava Plains Experiment).  The PIs will collect high-resolution (100 m spacing, 1 ms temporal sampling) P ? and S ? wave profiles at multiple azimuths in south-eastern Oregon.  The data will be analyzed for anisotropy and S ? wave velocity, utilizing the high spatial resolution.  Although some preliminary observations of crustal anisotropy have been made in the USA, it has not normally been possible to localize their depth extent, because passive observations are typically made at far lower frequencies (coarser resolution) than active-source measurements.  Hence the need to make 3 component (3C) active-source measurements to complement the now standard 3C passive-source receiver-function methods.  If the PIs are successful,  their results, in conjunction with the existing CD funded explosive-source refraction velocity model and receiver function images, will help estimate the relative roles of magmatic intrusions and crustal flow in maintaining crustal thickness in SE Oregon.In addition to collecting data of scientific interest to the CD-funded High Lava Plains Experiment, the PIs will demonstrate the technical feasibility of using three one-component (1C) recorders in parallel at a single site to record 3C data.  Success in the latter aim will open a path to fuller utilization of the PASSCAL and EarthScope Texan recording facility, more complete recording of the waveforms generated by NSF-funded controlled-source experiments, and extraction of additional scientific results from future experiments.  IRIS is arranging fabrication of 300 ?harnesses? to connect 900 existing 1C recorders (Texans) in groups of 3 to 300 existing 3C 4.5 Hz geophones, at no charge to this project."

The end result is that potentially any object in the real world is now  clickable : a picture of an object provides a hyperlink to the Internet. The proposed system utilizes a new method for sparse, multi-scale image representation based on the monogenic signal, a 2D generalization of the analytic signal that is robust to image transformations. By 2010, it is estimated that there will be over 1 billion mobile phones with cameras.The mobile phone is becoming an important connection between people and the digital world. The applications for mobile search technology are enormous and include national homeland security, product information retrieval (such as environmental ratings, pricing, or specifications), vision support for the blind, accessing object information for the disabled, and general purpose information retrieval including remote visual data analysis and inspection. Search technology has brought about many profound societal, educational and scientific benefits in the past decade.  The proposed mobile image search technology will extend those benefits to a broader base of users and applications."
14011,NSF,HHS,"The research objective of this award is to develop a new capability for the design of complex articulated linkage systems.  These systems form the skeletons of many machines, and this research expands the inventive reach of designers to explore novel new designs.  This research seeks to formalize a uniform approach to the synthesis of large arrays of complex linkage structures.  The combinatorial expansion of these structures and the increasing complexity of both their synthesis and analysis will be addressed using modern continuation methods in a parallel computing environment.  The research plan focuses on prototype computing tools for articulated systems that move in a plane, and progresses to address massively complex spatial system design.  These tools will be regularly applied to the invention of new systems to identify strengths and weakness of the approach. Deliverables include documentation of the theoretical results, distribution of prototype software, and demonstration and validation via hardware development as well as engineering student education.If successful, the results of this research will provide an expanded ability to invent products that provide controlled planar and spatial articulated movement.  Ease of construction and efficient operation make these devices cost effective and reliable design solutions.  However, the current computational burden of finding these solutions forces designers toward more complex and expensive computer controlled systems.  This research will provide effective tools for the analysis and design of complex articulated systems that can be applied at any scale. Example application areas include reverse engineering of protein structures, design of new complex micro-electro-mechanical systems, synthesis of novel home and factory automation devices and design of large space structures.  Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research."
14013,NSF,HHS,"Model building is often guided by features that enable performance analysis and analytic computations. Examples of such types of convenient features include linearity, Gaussian or light-tailed features. The investigators intend to develop mathematical tools that enable the analysis of stochastic systems that exhibit non-linear, non-Gaussian and potentially heavy-tailed type characteristics. Their goal is not only to provide tools that can be used to identify when Gaussian approximations are appropriate and at which spatial scales large deviations or heavy-tailed asymptotics should be used, but they also aim to develop techniques to improve upon Gaussian and tail asymptotics by means of corrected approximations and sharp large deviation results. These techniques will help researchers identify the spatial and temporal scales under which Gaussian approximations are valid. In addition, the investigators aim to provide tools that allow to understand how such spatial scales transition into a large deviations region which may incorporate heavy-tailed approximations and more refined information. Since the qualitative behavior of a system can change dramatically depending upon various input characteristics (e.g. light vs. heavy-tailed), identifying regions or scales when tractable approximations can be safely used would be of great value.        Recent developments in areas such as Communication Networks, Catastrophe Modeling, Insurance and Finance demand more complex time-series models that are either non-linear or exhibit non-Gaussian and/or even heavy-tailed features (such as ARCH and GARCH type processes). For example, portfolios of insurance claims or complex financial securities count their individual risk factors in the order of thousands. The factors can give rise to extremely large losses (heavy-tails) and the dependence structures among such factors, which is crucial in the overall risk profile, is very complex (giving rise to non-Gaussian behavior). As a consequence, the analysis of such complex models is challenging both computationally and analytically and therefore it is necessary to resort to approximations and efficient computational algorithms. The investigators propose the use and development of mathematical techniques to better understand when standard approximations, based on Gaussian laws and linearization, are applicable; when non-linear features must be taken into account and how does one transition from Gaussian-type approximations to a type of analysis that involves large losses or extreme behavior. The outcome of this research will improve the performance analysis of complex stochastic systems in the areas indicated above."
14027,NSF,NSF,"0824340Jeremiah T. Abiade, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State UniversityBRIGE: An Integrated Research and Educational Approach to High Efficiency Nanocomposite Thermoelectric Materials and DevicesAbstractIntellectual Merit:  The demands for efficient and clean energy are driving the intense search for nonpolluting, renewable energy sources to replace dwindling supplies of oil, coal, and gas. Thermoelectric devices can harvest waste energy and directly convert it into electrical energy, which is crucial as approximately 70% of our total primary energy is lost as waste heat. To date, thermoelectric materials and devices have been relegated to niche applications because of the low efficiency of the energy conversion process. Significant improvements in the thermoelectric materials? properties are required to realize the full potential of thermoelectric energy conversion devices. In this research we will focus on a class of promising thermoelectric materials called oxides. We will use pulsed laser deposition to deposit oxide thin/thick film thermoelectric materials with self-assembled nanoparticles embedded in the bulk of the films. Oxides are attractive because of their stability in high-temperature, high-humidity environments. The unique features of our proposed research are: 1) Emphasis on oxide thermoelectrics, a relatively new research field; 2) Use of self-assembled nanoinclusions to minimize thermal conductivity in oxide thermoelectrics through pulsed laser deposition; and 3) Integration of optimized structures into thermoelectric devices for waste heat recovery and low-power applications. Broader Impact:  This NSF-BRIGE project will be used as a platform to launch our program, Success Through Enthusiasm and Awareness of Materials Engineering Research (STEAMER). Project STEAMER is a summer research program for women and ethnic minority students. The outreach component of this project will prepare students from underrepresented groups for careers in engineering research. We believe that the mentoring and skills the students receive during this project will encourage them to pursue doctoral degrees and eventually develop research programs worthy of NSF support."

The first objective is to enable chip level self-assembly (currently performed with mm-sized components) at the 100 nm ¡V 50 ?Ým length scale. The second objective is to develop a process to assemble components, micro/nanochips with single angular orientation to enable ¡§Nano-Flip-Chip-Assembly¡¨ with contact pad registration. The approach utilizes surface tension to direct the self-assembly process. Intellectual MeritThe components are orders of magnitude smaller than current state of the art considering serial robotic pick and place.  In a broader sense, the ability to localize arbitrary materials and devices on arbitrary substrates allows the merging of technologies based on otherwise incompatible materials. Applications include flexible high performance electronics, solar cells, and sensor systems to gather optical, acoustic, chemical, and/or radiological data that would improve many areas of our daily lives including healthcare, the environment, energy, food safety, manufacturing, and national security.

Undergraduate students will also be involved in the research through an honors thesis project, and through REU and UROP opportunities.  The PI is also engaged with the Science Museum in Minnesota."
14042,NSF,NSF,"This new program will develop into an integral component of NYU's campus-wide diversity initiative, and will also play a central role in the university's transformation into a leading institution promoting the advancement of women and minorities in all areas of academic endeavor. The initial focus will be on the promotion and enhancement of the careers of women science faculty, but the program is designed also to serve as a springboard for acceleration and solidification of NYU's progress towards an excellent and diverse faculty. The NYU ADVANCE-PAID program is guided by two goals: 1) transformation of the institutional climate at NYU through programs that facilitate the recruitment and advancement of women in science, and 2) promotion of diversity studies at NYU and other institutions. Programs to achieve these goals include institutionalizing mentoring, development training, and assessment; providing greater access to and opportunities for networking and visibility; creating a family support initiative to aid in fieldwork and travel; providing recruitment training and incentives; and creating research challenge grants. Design of the programs is informed both by the literature and by NYU's specific needs. Intellectual merit. By bringing together national scholarship on diversity with NYU's internal studies and data collection, the programs are designed to replace impediments to women's progress in academic science with a climate that provides greater support and that facilitates advancement at all levels. The project supports diversity research in targeted areas, particularly those that study effectiveness of newer programs. Conferences and symposia on a variety of topics will disseminate new knowledge gained through these and related studies. Broader impacts. As a prominent university, NYU's progress towards a more equitable and diverse institution will have significant effects on the advancement of women within universities and in their respective academic disciplines. Greater numbers of women faculty with increased job satisfaction can have a multiplier effect, leading to increased numbers of women entering the sciences. Within the larger area, the PI and the ADVANCE-PAID Steering Committee will partner with neighboring institutions, beginning with Columbia University and Hunter College of the City of New York, to strengthen one another's programs through collaboration, coordination, and joint programs. For example, they will work together to organize and sponsor conferences to present a wide audience with new results and advances in diversity studies; will share best practices and lessons learned from their existing programs; and will consider exchanges of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to aid in recruitment and placement of women and underrepresented minorities. The program will be continuously evaluated and refined through internal data collection and assessment as well as periodic external review. It will provide a significant impetus to NYU, enabling it to achieve greater faculty excellence and become a stronger institution, in which both women and men thrive in a mutually supportive environment."

14060,NSF,NSF,"Intellectual Merit: X-ray crystallography is one of the best methods for the determination and study of 3-D structures of nucleic acids and protein-nucleic acid complexes at the atomic level. Such studies provide novel insights into nucleic acid functions and mechanisms. Via atom-specific substitution of nucleic acid oxygen with selenium, the research group on this project has pioneered and developed the selenium modification for nucleic acid heavy atom derivatization and crystallization, which are the two major challenges/bottlenecks in nucleic acid X-ray crystallography. This project has led to a successful demonstration of the utility of selenium derivatization for phasing, and to the discovery of crystallization facilitation by the 2'-Se derivatization of nucleic acids. The current research project involves further X-ray crystallographic studies on DNAs and RNAs in order to provide a viable rational solution for standard heavy atom derivatization and phase determination, as well as a potential solution for crystallization facilitation. The intellectual merit of this research project is in providing new insights into molecular interactions, packing, crystallization mechanisms, crystal growth facilitation, as well as structures of the Se-derivatized DNAs and RNAs and the corresponding natural nucleic acids. In addition, new synthetic routes to introduce Se into multiple positions of DNAs and RNAs will be developed for function and crystal structure studies.  Broader Impact of the Research: This research project will significantly enlarge scientific knowledge on nucleic acids, lead to novel materials and applications, allow broader access to these valuable new materials and unique molecules, as well as attract the attention of the general public. This research group will reach out to faculty members in research non-intensive colleges and high schools, and invite them to participate in this research project. The outreach and research opportunities will help to raise the awareness and scientific literacy of the general public. Moreover, many students, especially underrepresented minority students, will be trained through participation in this project in hands-on experimental research, and scientific communication skills. The Chemistry Department at Georgia State University (GSU) has a strong tradition of educating and serving undergraduate and graduate students, especially underrepresented minority students.

14063,NSF,HHS,"Developing Diverse Departments (3-D) at NC State  is designed to adopt/adapt a companion set of ADVANCE initiatives in order to address implicit biases and rarely articulated cultural stereotypes held within the university. Project goals are: (1) to increase the number of women and faculty of color in the professoriate, (2) to create a climate that promotes the success of all faculty, and (3) to eliminate factors that elevate women's and ethnic minorities' risk of leaving NCSU faculty positions. The project is organized into two arms. The first arm will increase the number of deans, center directors, and department heads who are actively and effectively creating conditions within their units that are favorable for advancing women and faculty of color. The second arm will increase the number of female and faculty of color who are emerging as academic leaders. Each arm will be linked to a core faculty group, called Advance Scholars, who have committed to becoming knowledgeable and effective change agents within college and university culture. Small and large workshops will bring together the project participants to share insights via informal and formal discussions and presentations. In overview, the project involves ever-widening circles of influence strategically designed to transfer knowledge about bias and stereotypes, through change agents, into communities of current and emerging academic leaders. 3-D at NC State thus condenses insights about the persuasiveness of respected colleagues in peer education regarding biases and stereotypes (from the University of Michigan's STRIDE program), the need to encourage change agents among faculty (from the organizing principles of the University of Washington's ADVANCE Program in the Center for Institutional Change), the importance of departmental climates in faculty satisfaction (from the University of Wisconsin-Madison WISELI's Climate Workshops for Department Chairs initiative), the value of identifying highly visible advocates for equity (from Georgia Tech's ADVANCE Professors Network initiative), and the critical importance of leadership training about diversity (from a wide selection of ADVANCE efforts across the nation). The project was developed in response to a Provost-appointed taskforce that undertook a year-long and institution-wide data collection and analysis initiative. With a projected hiring surge on the horizon, NC State is uniquely positioned to become a model for building a diverse and dynamic professoriate that is knowledgeable about, and willing to confront, biases and stereotypes in hiring, promotion, tenure, and leadership decision-making. The intellectual merit of the project rests on the ability and expertise of the principal investigators to test the theory that a  diffusion  of information about social biases and stereotypes into the professoriate will improve five key indicators: (1) the rate of hiring of women faculty and faculty of color, (2) the percentage of faculty of color and women among the professoriate and academic leadership, (3) the disproportionate risk of junior faculty women leaving before a tenure decision, (4) the level of employment satisfaction among faculty of color, and (5) the relationship between the number of women hired and perceived quality of newly hired faculty. We have baseline data on each of these indicators. The broader impacts of the project rest on our distillation of a model subset of initiatives from the riches of the ADVANCE effort, for application in university settings where institutional support for diversity initiatives outpaces attitudes in the faculty ranks. Changes in institutional policies and procedures are necessary but may not be sufficient to provoke a fully realized cultural shift in university culture, where faculty members play an active role in on-the-ground hiring and promotion decisions. 3-D at NC State is uniquely located, in time, place, and expertise, to examine how the lifeblood of the university, i.e. education, can spark a shift in attitudes among educators themselves, toward an inclusive and diverse academic community."
14073,NSF,NSF,"Rational simple connectedness is an algebraic notion which is to simple connectedness as rational connectedness is to path connectedness.Just as a topological fibration over a 2-dimensional base with simply connected fiber admits a continuous section, also an algebraic fibration over a surface with rationally simply connected general fiber admits a rational section (under suitable additional hypotheses).  This project investigates the theory beyond this result, just as topological obstruction theory is the theory beyond the quoted topological result. The first goal is to determine how the obstruction to  weak approximation (approximation of power series solutions by polynomial solutions) decomposes into a local obstruction and a global obstruction.  The second goal is to investigate the obstruction theory where it is not yet known by determining precisely which algebraic fibrations over a surface of a specified, simple type admit a rational section.Systems of polynomial equations are ubiquitous in mathematics, science and engineering.  In studying the collection of all solutions in complex numbers, i.e., the variety, associated to such a system, there is one special phenomenon: the system is  rationally connected  if for every pair of solutions, there is a polynomial map taking values in the variety and whose values interpolate between the given pair of solutions.  This special property is often satisfied in practice.  Surprisingly, a system of polynomial equations depending algebraically on 1 extra parameter (often thought of as time) always has a family of solutions varying as a polynomial of the parameter so long as the system for a fixed general choice of the parameter is rationally connected.  There is now an analogous theorem for a 2-parameter system, but with very strong constraints on the system.  The goal of the project is to weaken the constraint condition, and thus make the advance more widely applicable, by using notions analogous to those in topology, i.e.,  rubber-sheet geometry ."

The workshop will be organized around the four theme topics of: (1) extreme load definitions and combinations, (2) material performance, (3) retrofitting strategies, and (4) long-term strategies and plans for continuing US-India collaboration in these areas.  The objectives of the workshop are to assess the state of the art in the three areas in the two countries and then identify future research agenda and research and educational cooperative opportunities in these areas. The proposed activity will bring together international researchers working in the areas of the workshop theme topics for the exchange of scientific information and ideas.  The workshop topic is of strong research interest to both countries currently.  USA has a strong research base and expertise in these areas and India is now aggressively pursuing research in these areas.

This workshop will provide an excellent opportunity to the participants, especially the young researchers, for mutual appreciation of the cultural synergies that now exist between the scientific communities of the two countries for further advancement of science through joint research, faculty exchange opportunities, sabbatical opportunities, student exchange opportunities, and information technology and web-based collaborations."
14124,NSF,HHS,"Toward a Linear Time Sparse Solver with Locality-Enhanced Scalable ParallelismPadma Raghavan Many  computational science simulations  concern the numeric solution of partial differential equations using implicit or semi-implicit methods.  Such simulations often involve  nonlinear systems where the dominant costs are those for sparse linear system solution.  Sparse solvers present an array of performance challenges on current and future generation multicore chip-multiprocessor  architectures, and their networked ensembles into massively parallel processing systems. A new structured hybrid algorithm is sought to  enable reliable and scalable solution.  An inner-outer tree-structured scheme is formulated by  exploiting geometry for  tearing and interlacing of the graph of the coefficient matrix. Research  issues concern scalable parallelism, hardware latency-masking mapping of data, and geometric mechanisms to convey numeric properties of the coefficient matrix to accelerate the solution process."
14149,NSF,NSF,"This project develops and explores the use of mobile technologies to support intergenerational literacy experiences as a way to educate disadvantaged children. The project explores shared reading experiences on mobile phone platforms with local disadvantaged youths in order to develop principles and guidelines for a worldwide effort in distributing reading experiences on inexpensive and pervasive mobile technologies. This research has the potential to transform the use of mobile phones in the direction of literacy development as a complement to their current use for communication. The intellectual merit of this research comprises: an understanding of the design of image, text, and audio content on small screens to support literacy development in children; an understanding of effective collaborative literacy experiences when usability factors of mobile phones are considered in impoverished contexts; and an exploration of the opportunities provided by intergenerational learning when traditional classroom instruction is either not possible or has failed to reach learners with given resources. The broader impact of this project is the potential to focus researchers in other disciplines towards developing literacy, and the availability of the designs and content developed in this project to disadvantaged youths in other cities and countries."

14220,NSF,NSF,"Unrelated organisms inhabiting similar environments often exhibit strikingly similar morphologies.  Many members of the Order Cypriniformes (carp-like fishes) exhibit similar morphological adaptations for benthic life in fast flowing rivers (rheophilic). Due to their highly modified morphologies, evolutionary relationships of some benthic rheophiles, and members of the Indoburmese genus Psilorhynchus in particular, are unknown. This study will complete a phylogenetic analysis for Cypriniformes based on morphological and molecular data to discover evolutionary relationship of the enigmatic Psilorhynchus. The resulting hypothesis will be used to investigate evolutionary origins of a benthic rheophilic lifestyle within Cypriniformes and the origin of Psilorhynchus in the context of the biogeographic history of the Indoburmese region.This project will provide graduate training for co-PI Conway in molecular phylogenetic techniques and expose undergraduate students to morphological techniques and phylogenetic methodology. This project will foster a greater appreciation and understanding of morphological adaptations associated with life in fast flowing water. Data generated in this study will be deposited in online databases for public access."
14222,NSF,HHS,"Tyramine, octopamine, and tryptamine belong to a family of endogenous amines called trace amines (TAs) that have structural and metabolic similarities to the 'classical' neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and nor-epinephrine. While receptors for TAs were recently identified, their physiological relevance remains elusive. This project seeks to reveal that these substances control leg movements by acting on the spinal cord circuits responsible for locomotion. TAs are applied directly to the spinal cord to characterize their modulation of neural circuit function. In addition, electrical recordings from limb muscles are coupled with video-based analyses of limb movements to allow quantitative study of locomotor cycle-based activity patterns, detailing the effects of TAs on motor performance. The advances made will spur investigations that impact our understanding of how the spinal cord is 'engineered' to control locomotion. Overall, this project establishes ground-breaking science and methodology that incorporates cross-disciplinary mentoring of underrepresented engineering students from the Georgia Institute of Technology with training in the biological sciences at Emory, and a broadening of their activities through participation in conferences."
14225,NSF,HHS,"This project addresses the role of climatic changes during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles on the distribution and evolution of species in the Great Basin of western North America. The investigator uses reconstructions of climatic conditions of the last glacial maximum (approximately 21,000 years before present) to reconstruct species distributions during this cold period and contrasts them with modern distributions. She then formulates hypotheses about the changes in distributional locations and sizes through time and tests these hypotheses using genetic data. She applies this methodology to four species of kangaroo rats (genus Dipodomys) distributed within the Great Basin of North America and evaluates the response of each species to climatic changes over the past 21,000 years. This research aims to effectively test general theories on how Great Basin organisms responded to past climatic change.  Understanding the relationships between climatic changes, distributional changes, and population structure can provide an important foundation for conservation efforts. For example, regions where high genetic diversity has accumulated may represent areas where species have persisted through past episodes of climate change, and should therefore be prioritized as potential protected areas as the Earth experiences future episodes of human-induced climate change."
14244,NSF,NSF,"This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the development of an interdisciplinary graduate program in polar sciences and engineering by merging expertise and facilities from Dartmouth College with the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory and institutions in Greenland. The purpose of this program is to train doctoral students to have an interdisciplinary view of polar systems and to understand the social and ethical implications of their research. Broader impacts include training and research focused on the components of polar systems that respond to and contribute to rapid environmental change, including the cryosphere (glacial ice, snow, and sea ice systems) and the biogeochemical linkages between plants, soils, and animals. The core curriculum includes an Introduction to Polar Systems and a second course on Sustainability Science, Policy and Ethics that will train students to frame research questions that will have relevance to Arctic residents and policy by using perspectives from western science and traditional ecological knowledge. Depending on their research interests, students will be trained during the Greenland Field Seminar in either terrestrial ecosystem or cryosphere dynamics, followed by instruction in the human dimensions of Arctic change in Nuuk, the site of the University of Greenland and the Inuit Circumpolar Council. IGERT students will receive continuing interdisciplinary training through a seminar series and other related events on polar science and policy organized with the Dickey Center Institute of Arctic Studies, a workshop on preparing grant proposals, an annual program evaluation and research symposium, cross-IGERT activities, and opportunities for specialized training at other institutions or field sites. A special effort will be made to engage with Native American students.

14304,NSF,HHS,"CBET-0827398KrasnoperovThe research seeks to establish the important high-pressure combustion chemistry need for practically important combustion processes, including internal combustion engines. Combustion efficiency and stability, internal engine knock, emission of environmentally noxious substances are the problems which require detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms with well-characterized elementary reactions over extended temperature and pressure ranges. However, the kinetic data necessary for advancement of combustion models at elevated pressures are still insufficient. Laboratory measurements usually provide rate constants at  convenient  pressures (0.001 - 1 bar). They are necessarily extrapolated to higher pressures based on theoretical foundations, but such predictions may introduce significant additional uncertainties into the model predictions. The specific research objective is a systematic fundamental study on the kinetics and mechanisms of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions of free radicals of combustion importance such as HCO, CH3, OH, and HO2 over extended temperature and elevated pressure ranges. Pulsed laser photolysis combined with high-pressure flow system and transient absorption-spectroscopy techniques will be used in the experimental studies. Buffer gas density affects the rates and branching ratios of dissociation and isomerization reaction, bimolecular reactions that proceed via an intermediate complex, as well as the corresponding reverse reactions. The comparison of the measurements of the pressure fall-off in this reaction with theoretical calculations will lead to the further advancement of the theory of unimolecular dissociation and the RRKM theory with isolated resonances. Overall, the proposed research program will contribute to extending the knowledge and understanding the buffer gas density effects. Broader impacts of the proposed work arise through publications and presentations in the technical and scientific community, by the education and training of students and new scientists, and through advancement of synergetic collaborations between disciplines and institutions, both domestic and international. The research will rely upon training and participation of graduate as well as undergraduate students."
14319,NSF,HHS,"Analysis of liquefaction-induced instability and failure in slopes and embankments is an important problem of geotechnical earthquake engineering.  While various empirically-based and/or simplified approaches have been developed and used in practice, the current state of knowledge of stress-strain-strength behavior of liquefiable soils, the wealth of observed response of soil slopes and embankments during recent earthquakes, and the significant progress in numerical modeling of engineering structures in recent years, have prepared the ground for a more rigorous, yet realistic, approach to the analysis of liquefaction-induced instability and failure.  This project is to develop a multiscale approach, which allows the soil response to be captured in both pre- and post-failure stages with a unified constitutive model.  Moreover, since the traditional finite element (FE) approach for fully-coupled effective stress analysis of soils is severely limited in handling the near- and post-failure response of a geotechnical system, a meshfree method is proposed to overcome the known difficulties of an FE approach, and to produce reliable and robust solutions in all stages of a liquefaction analysis. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the development and introduction of two very powerful constitutive and numerical methods in the analysis of soil liquefaction.  The proposed methods will be implemented in a public domain open source code, which can be used by researchers and practitioners.  The developed computational tool will be validated and verified against a series of experimental and field observations on the responses of soil slopes and embankments.The broader impacts of the project include the potential use of the techniques developed in this research in other fields of engineering such as bio-poromechanics and hot rolling processes in metals and alloys.  The graduate students trained in the course of this project will have an excellent opportunity to develop a thorough understanding of the mechanisms involved in liquefaction and liquefaction-induced deformation and failure as well as an expertise in modeling of geotechnical systems using two of the most advanced methods of analysis and modeling in engineering mechanics.  The depth and breadth of such research training should be of significant value to geotechnical engineering practice."
14341,NSF,HHS,"Abstract - Aquatic Propulsion LaboratoryPIs ? Jarek Rossignac, Georgia Institute of Technology / Eva Kanso, University of Southern CaliforniaThe oceans are filled with creatures with a wondrous array of shapes and swimming styles, yet only a small number of these have been studied. The goal of the Aquatic Propulsion Laboratory is to create computer tools for reverse engineering and evaluating the aquatic locomotion strategies across species in order to advance our knowledge of the biology and mechanics of swimming. Moreover, some of these unexplored swimming styles may inspire the design of better artificial swimmers for use in aquatic exploration, engineering, and medicine. The created tools, data sets, animations, and digital models of swimming styles will be made available to other researchers, students, and educators.Our research combines: 1) inventing geometric representations of deforming bodies for aquatic locomotion, and interactive tools for combining them, 2) employing analytic and numerical techniques for simulating the motion of these digital swimmers, and 3) developing control and optimization methods that allow us to find the most efficient motion strategies for a given body. For validation, we are comparing our synthetic motion to published results of tail-driven motion of thunniform and carangiform fish.  This validation informs our study of other swimming styles, including the flapping of the wing-like pectoral fins of rays, the vertical tail motions of whales and dolphins, the traveling waves along the dorsal fins of electric eels and the mantles of cuttlefish, the paddle-driven motion of sea turtles, the tail kicks of lobsters and the rippling bells of jellyfish. For each swimming style, we are designing a geometric model and a set of parameterized behaviors that can be controlled to achieve coordinated motion and task-level goals. We are also conducting studies of the effectiveness of these swimming styles under different fluid conditions and goals."
14407,NSF,NSF,"Recent progress in bioinformatics, natural language understanding, computer vision, information retrieval and other areas has been significantly enabled by  conditional random fields  (CRFs)---machine learning models of structured outputs, such as sequences, trees and grids.  However, many of the fundamental problems in these application areas involve not just fixed structures, but structures that must be inferred.  This structural ambiguity arises from interacting choices at different levels of representation (e.g. from character sequences to meaning, or from pixels to scene interpretation).  The project will move conditional random fields (CRFs) beyond fixed graphical structures to structures that are constructed dynamically during inference.  Such a capability will be key to building next-generation systems that solve, not just an individual piece of a problem, but complex multi-step problems, as found in natural language understanding and computer vision, in a unified way."

14516,NSF,NSF,"Saturated soil consists of a solid phase and a fluid phase.  Individual solid grains form a deformable solid skeleton with interconnected pores filled with fluids.  When saturated soil undergoes shear wave excitations, the relative motion between the two phases has two effects on the dynamic behavior of saturated soil: pore fluid induced damping (i.e., energy dissipation) and effective soil density.  The effective soil density is related to the fraction of pore fluid that moves with the solid skeleton during shear wave propagation, and is always smaller or equal to the saturated density.  Due to a lack of quantitative assessment of these two effects in published literature, they are generally neglected in current geotechnical engineering research and practice.  However, recent research indicates that these two effects are important for soils with high permeability (e.g., sands and gravels) and/or under high-frequency excitations.  The objective of this research is to provide fundamental understanding, quantitative assessment, and practical solutions to pore fluid induced damping and effective density in saturated soil.  This research is primarily motivated by the wide spread and increasing popularity of geotechnical laboratory and field tests involving high-frequency shear waves (e.g., centrifuge, bender elements, seismic CPT).  The objective of this research will be achieved through analytical study and experimental testing.  In the proposed analytical study, analytical solutions of pore fluid induced damping and effective density will be derived based on a framework that considers both Biot flow and squirt flow.  The proposed experimental testing will use resonant column tests to provide validation of the analytical work and examine the effects of shear strain and specimen size.  This research will serve to bridge the gap between theory and practice by developing solutions that can be easily used by researchers and practitioners.  It has the potential to transform the way in which researchers and engineers interpret data and perform analyses relating to soil dynamics and geotechnical earthquake engineering.  Ultimately, the benefits will be the reduction of losses to society as a result of earthquakes.  Broader impacts also include improving educational opportunities in the area of geotechnical engineering at Clarkson University.  A soil dynamics testing laboratory is currently being developed to conduct research and educate students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

To overcome the limitations of existing technology, actuators based on magnetostrictive Terfenol-D, capable of ultrasonic vibration as well as high-speed macro deformations will be used.  The objectives of the project are to (1) design and construct a novel Terfenol-D actuator to achieve the required performance of microforming applications; (2) develop a suite of advanced model-based feedforward-feedback control techniques to overcome the nonlinear hysteresis and dynamics effects of Terfenol-D on high-speed, precision motion control; and (3) investigate the fundamental aspects of microforming by studying how the tool life and part quality are improved by the introduction of ultrasonic vibration and high speed operation.The proposed research represents one of the first attempts in utilizing Terfenol-D actuators in the next-generation micro-machine tool system (mMTS).  This will lead to increased tool life, improved part quality, and reduced footprint addressing several critical challenges in micro-manufacturing including maintenance cost, energy consumption, and throughput limitations.  The novel application of the dual stage magnetostrictive actuator along with the advanced control techniques will enable the systematic study of the fundamental effects of high frequency vibration on microforming processes making significant contributions to moving microforming techniques towards industry applications.

14618,NSF,HHS,"Price 0738658This award supports a project to use two new scanning fluorimeters to map microbial concentrations vs depth in the WAIS Divide ice core as portions of it become available at NICL, and selected portions of the GISP2 ice core for inter-hemispheric comparison.  Ground-truth calibrations with microbes in ice show that the instruments are sensitive to a single cell and can scan the full length of a 1-meter core at 300-micron intervals in two minutes.  The goals of these studies will be to exploit the discovery that microbes are transported onto ice, in clumps, several times per year and that at rare intervals (not periodically) of ~104 years, a much higher flux, sometimes lasting >1 decade, reaches the ice.   From variations ranging from seasonal to millennial to glacial scale in the arrival time distribution of phototrophs, methanogens, and total microbes in the Antarctic and Arctic ice, the investigators will attempt to determine oceanic and terrestrial sources of these microbes and will look for correlations of microbial bursts with dust concentration and temperature proxies. In addition the project will follow up on the discovery that the rare instances of very high microbial flux account for some of the gas artifacts  in ice cores - isolated spikes of excess CH4 and N2O that have been discarded by others in previous climate studies. The intellectual merit of this project is that it will exploit scanning fluorimetry of microbes as a powerful new tool for studies ranging from meteorology to climatology to biology, especially when combined with mapping of dust, gases, and major element chemistry in ice cores.  In 2010-11 the WAIS Divide borehole will be logged with the latest version of the dust logger. The log will provide mm-scale depth resolution of dust concentration and of volcanic ash layers down the entire depth of the borehole. The locations of ash layers in the ice will be determined and chemical analyses of the ash will be analyzed in order to determine provenance. By comparing data from the WAIS Divide borehole with data from other boreholes and with chemical data (obtained by others) on volcanic layers, the researchers will examine the relationship between the timing of volcanic eruptions and abrupt climate change. Results from this project with the scanning fluorimeters and the dust logger could have applications to planetary missions, borehole oceanography, limnology, meteorology, climate, volcanology, and ancient life in ice. A deeper understanding of the causes of abrupt climate change, including a causal relationship with volcanic explosivity, would enable a better understanding of the adverse effects on climate. The broader impact of the project is that it will provide training to students and post-docs from the U. S. and other countries."

14702,NSF,HHS,"The research objective of this award is to develop methods for modeling and design of complex vibration dampers (CVDs).  A CVD consists of a large number of light vibration elements to be attached to a small region of a dynamical system to mitigate damage that would otherwise obtain because of the action of a complex forcing.  The research will result in an analytical framework to provide the basis for prediction models, and thereby design strategies, for a broad range of applications.  The research approach progresses from the protection of relatively simple structural elements, e.g. beams and plates, subject to idealized external forces to more complicated structural systems, e.g. structural frames, subject to highly complex and uncertain forces acting.  Deliverables include an increased understanding of the role of CVDs in controlling the introduction of energy to a dynamical system by a complex external forcing; a parameterization of the asymptotic regime that defines the potential uses of CVDs, distinguishing sub-regimes for which the potential is greatest; and, the identification of system measures for the purpose of design.     If successful, the results of this research will provide an opportunity for the design of a new class of damage mitigating systems, for a range of structural systems and forcing conditions.  One possible application would be mitigating the damage of a civil engineering structure, a high-rise building or bridge, subject to an earthquake force.  Another would be enhancing the crash worthiness of vehicles.  Still another would be reducing the severity of the interior of a military transport vehicle, subject to the blast force of a nearby explosion.  Successful demonstration of the efficacy of CVDs for any and all of these applications will be disseminated to the appropriate engineering community for commercial exploitation."
14727,NSF,NSF,"****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This project focuses on aspects of electronic transport in semiconductor superlattices - structures that are composed of many alternating layers of different semiconductor materials, with each layer having a width of only a few nanometers.  The flow of electrical current in these structures is highly nonlinear and this leads to complex switching behavior in the current response to changes in applied voltage.  A major objective of the project is to understand how this switching dynamics depends on a number of experimental parameters that can be systematically varied.  New measurement techniques and data analysis methods will be utilized in this project and will be applicable to a range of other physical systems that operate far from their respective equilibrium states.  This research will contribute to the understanding of physical processes that are important for emerging technological development. It will provide new, fundamental insight into the nonlinear electrical properties of superlattices with potential impact for a range of nanoscale electronic structures and optoelectronic devices, such as state-of-the-art lasers and sensitive light detectors. Graduate and undergraduate training is central to this project; students will become skilled in cutting edge measurement and computer simulation techniques preparing them for productive careers in industry or academic research.  Experimental samples for this project will be fabricated in collaboration with researchers in Germany, and this will provide valuable educational opportunities for graduate students.****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This project addresses fundamental aspects of nonlinear electronic transport in semiconductor superlattices through the investigation of GaAs/AlAs samples that possess electric field domains and associated current bistability.  For such systems, the transient response to changes in applied voltage leads to current switching dynamics that may be purely stochastic or may involve a combination of complex deterministic and stochastic mechanisms.  The project investigates the dependence of switching dynamics on the conductivity of contact layers, the form of applied voltage pulses, the cross sectional dimensions of samples, and the level of external photoexcitation.  Novel measurement and data analysis methods will elucidate the important role played by metastable states in current switching.  Metastable states strongly influence dynamics for a wide range of non-equilibrium systems, and superlattices offer an ideal system for such studies due to their excellent structural characterization and capability for precise electrical measurement.  This research will also provide fundamental insight on the interplay of quantum tunneling and space-charge dynamics, with potential impact for nanoscale electronic structures and optoelectronic devices.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art measurement and simulation techniques providing them with strong preparation for careers in industry or academic research.  Experimental samples for this project will be fabricated in collaboration with researchers in Germany; this will provide valuable educational opportunities for graduate students."
14734,NSF,NSF,"This project encompasses the determination of the three-dimensional molecular structures of a number of flexible filamentous plant viruses. It is part of a comprehensive, integrated structural analysis of the filamentous plant viruses, aimed at explaining the processes of viral infection, dissemination, and host interactions, and understanding the relationships among these important viruses. The viruses to be studied include members of the potexvirus, potyvirus, and closterovirus groups. The potexviruses are of great significance as models for fundamental virology and cell biology; they have enormous potential in biotechnology, and they are of considerable importance for the damage they cause in agriculture. The potyviruses are responsible for half the viral crop damage in the world, and are of interest because of their close relationship to the animal rhinoviruses (responsible for such diverse conditions as the common cold, polio, and foot-and-mouth disease). The closteroviruses are also of major agricultural significance. To utilize the full potential of the flexible filamentous viruses as models and in biotechnology, and to combat their effects in agriculture, knowledge of three-dimensional structures in atomic detail is required. Apart from this group's preliminary results, there are no three-dimensional structures known for any flexible filamentous virus. Virus structures to be determined will include the most important of the potexviruses, potato virus X, as well as the potyviruses soybean mosaic virus and wheat streak mosaic virus and the closterovirus beet yellows virus. Structures will be determined by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray fiber diffraction; models derived from cryo-electron microscopy will be used as starting points for more detailed analysis using fiber diffraction data. Fiber diffraction specimen preparation methods developed in this laboratory have greatly improved the quality of data from potexviruses and potyviruses; before this project began, no useful diffraction data had been obtained from potyviruses. Broader impacts will be through the integration of research and education, and through the application of this research to new developments in crop protection and plant biotechnology, particularly in the production of pharmacologically useful products. This laboratory has a strong program of involvement of undergraduates and K-12 teachers in research, and the project activities will include undergraduates, graduate students, and K-12 teachers and students."
14796,NSF,NSF,"Proposal # 0834252: Support for ISBE 2008 conferencePI: Sandra L. VehrencampSupport from the NSF will provide funds for the 12th biennial congress of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology (ISBE) to be held at Cornell University in August 2008.  ISBE congresses are exceptionally international in composition and held alternately in the New World and the Old World. ISBE meetings are also unusually gender-balanced, both in participation and in leadership, and the strongly international membership and meeting structure are designed to facilitate interactions between the most well known researchers in the field and the many younger scientists and students from around the world who attend these meetings. ISBE congresses tend to place a greater emphasis on the theoretical bases and processes of behavioral evolution than Animal Behavior Society meetings. The explicit blend of theory and experiment has continued to be the main thread linking members of the Society as topics have evolved and shifted in popularity. Taxonomic coverage is broad, ranging from invertebrates to vertebrates including humans, and primary topics include communication, cooperation and conflict, sexual selection, personality, and foraging strategies. The 2008 ISBE congress has attracted a record number of participants (1020 scientists), the largest conference ever held at Cornell and a challenge for the campus. Press coverage will disseminate the exciting new scientific findings into the news services for worldwide distribution."
14800,NSF,HHS,"This research project will study the structural behavior of steel shear angle connections to fire hazard. Steel shear angle connections are often used in steel framed buildings to support the floor beams and provide overall stability to the structure. In case of an internal fire, the performance of these connections plays a crucial role on the response of the structure as a whole. It is thus important to understand the behavior of these connections exposed to fire. Full-scale fire experiments and numerical studies will be conducted at Michigan State University and Princeton University to improve the basic understanding of the behavior of such connections for the entire range of loading from pre-fire stage to collapse stages. The study will evaluate the fire performance of the improved connection details. The project will generate basic data for improved design of these connections for realistic fire and external loading.  This data will be used to formulate the guidelines for the design and fire resistance evaluation of shear angle connections.  The proposed design guidelines will facilitate the development of US codes and Standards for the design of structures for fire hazards, and integration of fire design into overall structural design methodology. The guidelines are expected to produce cost-effective and enhanced fire-safe designs of steel structures. The wide dissemination of the research results and data to researchers and practitioners is planned for quick implementation of the design guidelines in practice.  The project will also train the next generation of skilled workforce for fire resistant design of steel structures through the direct involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the project work."
14847,NSF,NSF,"The research objective of this award is to investigate a novel manufacturing process that allows the controlled 'localized' sintering of micro-scale and nano-scale features and devices from powders. The process, named Current-Activated Tip-based Sintering (CATS), uses a micro or nano conductive tip to simultaneously apply electric current and controlled contacting pressure to the surface of a powder bed. The path of the tip is controlled to sinter/consolidate simple or complex geometries. The present study is designed to answer a number of fundamental scientific questions for this process and will be addressed through both experimental and modeling efforts. The influence of process variables including current density, current form, tip speed and powder green density/packing on the characteristics of the area of influence beneath the tip (process zone) and sintering behavior will be studied. If successful, the approach can be adopted for 1D, 2D and 3D micro and nano-scale powder-based fabrication. Advantages of the process also include ultra-rapid heating and sintering rates un-attainable by conventional sintering, and a process zone that should be attained even on the nano-scale. The study will offer important insights into the underlying mechanisms responsible for the localized current-activated 'tip-based' sintering behavior. The approach can be applied to a very wide range of materials, including metals, intermetallics, shape memory alloys, porous materials and composites. This technology would have wide spread applications within a number of industries, including micro/nano-sensors and actuators, micro/nano-filters and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)."
14864,NSF,HHS,"This project is awarding scholarships to talented students to increase the quantity and diversity of students who complete undergraduate degrees in computer science or mathematics. Students are recruited from both local secondary schools and community colleges, with twelve scholarships offered annually. A number of project components that are designed to increase academic success contribute to the intellectual merit of this effort. These include: combining appropriate-level classes in mathematics to create cohort groups of computer science and mathematics students; providing student-student, faculty-student, and industry-student mentoring programs and workshops; and motivating students through opportunities for research projects and internships. A diverse management team is also in place including department faculty leaders in the two departments, the Director of Financial Services, and the Dean of the College housing the computer science and mathematics departments. Additional student support services units on campus are also involved. In terms of broader impacts the project is promoting increased participation of talented Hispanics in the fields of computer science and mathematics through its financial, academic, and practical support. This is leading to an increase in the talent base and diversity of newly graduated persons entering either the workforce or pursuing advanced degrees."
14872,NSF,NSF,"0744045VanZandtThis award, jointly funded by NSF and the USGS, will permit the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory of the University of California at Berkeley (BSL), in collaboration with its commercial partner, Metrozet, LLC (Torrance, CA), to develop and test new mechanical sensors for the Streckeisen STS-1 Very Broad-Band (VBB) seismometer. The STS-1, widely viewed as the finest VBB sensor in the world, is currently the principal seismometer used by the Global Seismographic Network (GSN) and several other global or regional seismic networks. Its continued operation is critical to future, fundamental research in a number of important disciplines within seismology. These include studies of the earth's deep interior, the determination of source processes of very large earthquakes, and tsunami warning.  However, the STS-1 is no longer manufactured commercially.  The ultimate goal of the team is to develop a design that allows an integrated, triaxial STS-1 sensor to be manufactured, sold, and supported at a cost that is competitive with current (lower performance) sensors.  Of equal importance is that the new sensor be available with shorter leadtimes than is typical with many past and current sensors.  This work will also provide significant educational and training opportunities for seismic instrumentation engineers, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students at UC Berkeley."

Basu, Sarbani; Batista, Victor S.; Ismail-Beigi, Sohrab; Smooke, Mitchell D.Institution: Yale University   New Haven, CT 06520-8337Title:    MRI/Acq.: Acq. of a High Performance Computational Cluster for Yale UniversityProject Proposed:This project, acquiring instrumentation for a large-scale computing system, enables research in the physical, biological, and social sciences, as well as engineering, linguistics, statistics, and many other fields, under the umbrella of a High Performance Computing (HPC) Center. The instrumentation complements the Biomedical HPC center. Supported by the Information Technology Services (ITS), these centers are considered a single virtual unit. This work services 52 research projects from faculty in 22 departments including physical sciences, engineering, linguistics, mathematics, ecology, economics, psychology, statistics, and the biological sciences. The very diverse research covers a wide range of topics from cosmological simulations to climate modeling, to neural circuit networks and simulation of internal dynamics, to economic modeling, to name a few. The research is supported by more than 35 current and more than 20 pending projects. Research computational scientists assist with the instrumentation, teach parallel programming techniques, optimize current code, and write new codes to support individual projects.

14943,NSF,NSF,"This project specifically addresses an important aim of the 2010 project - to identify genetically stable loss-of-function mutations in all Arabidopsis genes. Computational analysis of the initial genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana in 2000 provided evidence for the existence of approximately 25,500 genes. Intensive efforts during the past six years to experimentally annotate this genome sequence have identified many additional protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes, expanding the gene list to 31,128 genes. Importantly, even the most current version of the genome annotation does not include many hundreds of unannotated non-coding (large and small) RNA genes. The identification of T-DNA/transposon insertion mutations in all Arabidopsis genes has been an on-going aim of worldwide functional genomics programs. Analysis of the current set of sequence-indexed integration sites reveals that mutations for ~6,000  new  genes have not yet been identified. This project will use specific gene-directed PCR to identify two insertion mutations for each of these 6,000 genes, thereby allowing completion of the  uni-mutant  set for annotated Arabidopsis genes. In addition, the project will provide for the genotyping of these mutations which segregate for these T-DNA insertions to identify homozygous mutants in all genes that do not lead to lethality or infertility. In addition, large-scale genotyping of the known Salk, SAIL, Wisconsin and GABI-KAT T-DNA insertion mutant lines will be done as part of the effort to obtain homozygous insertion mutants in the 25,000 genes initially identified by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative.  Combined, these efforts will result in the production of a  unimutant  set of homozygous insertion mutations for the core set of plant genes. When completed, this resource will enable the initiation of whole genome phenotypic screens, allowing the identification of genes important for understanding basic plant biology as well those genes whose functions are important to further improvement of food, biomass and energy production.Broader Impacts.  The genomic resources developed by this project will be widely available to a large number of researchers, will provide the basis for a variety of research projects that rely upon whole genome information and will enable genome-wide mutant screens for any visible phenotype of interest. All of the mutant plants will be available to the broader research community as soon as they are produced through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC).  All DNA sequence data (T-DNA insertions and genome sequences) will be deposited in GenBank, and TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org). The data will also be made available via the SIGnAL database (http://signal.salk.edu/cgibin/tdnaexpress), allowing browsing/retrieval of these data types, integration with the genome annotation, transcription units and DNA methylation, cDNA/ORF clones, and with all public insertion mutant sequences.  An equally important aspect of the project is the hands-on training in plant genome research that will be provided at a variety of levels, including outreach to minority high school and undergraduate students."
15014,NSF,NSF,"Of all the common elements in the Earth's crust, iron is the only element that occurs in multiple valence states; it can be found as a pure Fe(0) metal, as Fe(II), or as Fe(III). The valence state of iron thus reflects the amount of oxygen that was present in the environment at the time the mineral crystallized. The amount of oxygen in turn affects how a magma may crystallize: which minerals will form, and in what order. For this reason, measuring the oxidation state of Fe is extremely important in all rock types in which the minerals occur in equilibrium. The valence state of Fe thus serves as a recorder of the evolution of oxygen in the Earth's interior and on its surface. It is also useful in identifying geological formations of economic interest (for example, garnets in diamond-bearing deposits are usually oxidized). The ability to measure Fe valence state is also useful in understanding chemical reactions that control industrial processing of minerals, chemical and metallurgical engineering, recycling of materials, and even the study of health effects and mineralogy.Historically, it has been very difficult to measure the valence state of Fe in minerals quantitatively. Traditional wet chemistry methods have been used for a half-century, but they require large masses of sample (>1 g) and these are difficult to prepare from rocks that may contain intimate mixtures of fine-grained minerals. Mössbauer spectroscopy is another bulk technique that has more recently been used for measurements of Fe, but it also requires >20 mg of sample. Microfocused X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) presents a promising technology for making Fe3+/total Fe measurements on small spots (8-30 microns) on mineral grains. This technique utilizes the observation that the energy of the Fe K absorption edge and the absorption pre-edge feature found ~15-20 eV below the edge are very sensitive to the oxidation state of Fe. Past measurements of Fe3+/total Fe by this technique have been only semi-quantitative, but recent upgrades at the hard x-ray microprobe beamline x26a at the National Synchrotron Light Source (higher beam intensity and improved energy resolution available from a Si(311) monochromator) have remedied these issues. Thus, the ambitious goal of this proposal is to develop the XANES technique for use as a quantitative microprobe method for analysis of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in minerals."
15017,NSF,NSF,"RNA molecules are an important component of the cellular machinery. They are now known to be essential for numerous biological processes, including protein synthesis, transcription regulation, chromosome replication, viral infection, and RNA interference. However, our knowledge of RNA molecules is still limited. This research project fills important gaps in current RNA studies by introducing novel molecular models and efficient computational tools. Specifically, the research team aims to solve the following problems under a coherent theme of studying pseudoknotted RNA structure and understanding their properties: (1) Estimation of entropy of key secondary elements of RNA molecules; (2) Identification of stable pseudoknot motifs from RNA sequences and developing libraries of pseudoknot motifs for RNA families; (3) Prediction of three dimensional ensemble of pseudoknotted RNA molecules and characterize their folding mechanism. All these problems involve exploration of probability distributions on very large state spaces where novel mathematical and statistical tools must be developed. Specifically, the research team studies and develops several techniques including efficient constrained Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and mixing rate acceleration schemes and their combinations. The methodological development provides a solid foundation for solving the underlying biological problems. In return, those problems serve as the testing ground and inspiration of new statistical ideas and procedures. The cross-fertilization is ideal for significant advances in both biological and statistical sciences. It provides a perfect environment of education and training of the next generation of scientists and researchers in the interdisciplinary field of mathematics/ statistics and biology.

15023,NSF,HHS,"One of the most fundamental features of Earthquake ruptures is that they exhibit spatial-temporal complexity. Yet understanding the evolution and implications of the chaotic dynamics in systems with spontaneous rupture is far from being complete. Since the full multi-scale numerical simulation of 3-D media is numerically intractable with current computational capabilities, the goal of this project is to investigate the possibility of constructing ?reduced models? that retain the essential physics of this complex dynamical system. The reduced models will be used to generate approximate, numerically efficient solutions that predict fault slip caused by spontaneous dynamic frictional sliding events in the presence of heterogeneous pre-stress (earthquakes).  The researchers will investigate both deterministic and stochastic model reduction techniques. The reduction philosophy hinges on the selection of a group of variables called ?coarse variables? that average (in an appropriate sense) the fine scale dynamics and capture the macroscopic features of the studied dynamical system. Slip can then be calculated as a function of these coarse variables without resorting to detailed simulations.  A diverse set of simulation tools will be used, combining methods from statistical mechanics, nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic modeling and geophysics. Particular attention will be given to techniques being developed in the DARPA-Dynarum program that involves, as a key ingredient, the Markov learning methods, whereby the coarse variable learn their dynamics from fine scales simulations. The project will support a collaboration between geophysicists and mathematicians, and will fund a graduate student to work on this multi-disciplinary project. Understanding earthquake occurrence using the models these investigators will explore may help improve our knowledge of earthquake hazard."
15027,NSF,HHS,"In this proposal the PI will study how a desert dwelling lizard, the Sandfish, swims beneath the surface of a granular material. Imaging methods will be developed to surmount the difficulties of visualizing biological systems in opaque terrestrial media and computational modeling tools will be created to study the interaction of the organism with materials whose equations of motion are unknown. These efforts will occur in three interacting thrust areas: (1) Measurements of organism motion and dynamics: A multiplane, high speed and resolution x-ray imaging system will be built to obtain the first three dimensional kinematics of an organism moving within a complex medium. Both the kinematics and forces will be characterized as the substrate properties are systematically varied by use of an air fluidized bed. (2) Physics experiment to characterize response of granular media to swimming motions: Developing models of the locomotion will require understanding the physics of the material response in this regime in which the bulk of the material behaves like a solid except for a small region surrounding the organism which behaves like a fluid. The forces associated with maneuvering objects through the granular medium will be measured and the results use to produce an empirical model of force production. (3) Computer models of organism and granular media: As granular media are amenable to direct numerical simulation, development of a 3D Molecular Dynamics simulation interacting with the actuated objects (lizard models) used in experiment will result in numerical environment interaction models that can be used to interrogate the motion at the grain level as well as to create the first models of biological organisms moving within this material. The experimental data obtained from studying the organism will suggest actuation strategies that will be played through the physics experiments and validated models. This study will initiate the beginnings of a deeper understanding of movement within non-Newtonian media and thus will result in a new model system for locomotion biology, as well as models for locomotion. This work will create rapid modeling tools to aid design of robotic exploration and search & rescue devices that must burrow through challenging terrain. It will also gather students from a diverse range of backgrounds: physics students will interact with biology students to make progress on experiments and models. This program will serve as a springboard to develop a course examining control of locomotion, mechanical properties of biological actuators (muscle), skin friction, rheology of complex matter, etc. Outside the university, the program will provide outreach by engaging the public in visible and graspable science."
15041,NSF,HHS,"The pathways leading to the indolic amino acid tryptophan are of critical importance because tryptophan is required in animal and human diets and because indolic compounds are used as intercellular signals in plants and animals.  In addition, indolic pathways reside at the interface of primary and secondary metabolism and function as a node in dynamic metabolic processes that may be predictive of the metabolic status of individual cell types. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the potential of metabolite quantification or profiling methods (metabolomics) to provide insight at the single cell level into the cellular and metabolic consequences of disrupting genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. This approach will answer important questions about differences in metabolism between cells that are in close proximity to one another, but which differ in their origin, function or ultimate fate.  The project will take advantage of approaches that have been effective when applied to cell-specific transcript profiling, namely sorting of cells with fluorescent protein-tagged fusion proteins in specific cell types, and will apply them to targeted metabolite profiling on a submicro-scale.  Tryptophan biosynthesis is an excellent metabolic pathway for such studies not only because the pathway exists at the interface between primary and secondary metabolism, but also because increased tryptophan levels are a potentially valuable crop plant trait and a target for metabolic engineering for animal and human health. A project website (http://www.auxin.org) will detail the specific objectives and progress of the project, including metabolite profiling data.  Mutant lines will be deposited at the ABRC.Broader Impacts: The major objective of this project is to advance the methodology of metabolomics (metabolite quantification) at the tissue and cellular levels to the point that it is routinely available to the broader plant community as part of the functional genomics toolbox.   The PIs will develop a workshop to disseminate metabolomics methods to the broader scientific community.  This project will train postdoctoral fellows, who will be well-positioned to continue the development and application of metabolomics as a genomics tool. The project will interface with on-going activities to recruit and train members of underrepresented groups.The activities meet the goals of the 2010 Project by addressing a recognized need to focus on metabolite profiling in order to characterize the localizome, that is, information about gene and protein expression patterns and metabolite concentrations and flux at the organ, tissue, cellular and/or subcellular levels in the living plant. As noted in the 2010 Project mid-course assessment, knowledge of small molecule biology in Arabidopsis is not only fundamental for a holistic understanding of plant biology, but also in the context of plants as a source of food for both humans and animals as well as sources of pharmaceuticals.  As an essential amino acid, tryptophan biosynthesis is broadly relevant, and the approaches developed will allow the study of any metabolite network in plants."

15086,NSF,NSF,"The objective of this research is to design wireless optical communication techniques for integration into sensor networks. The approach is to employ low-cost, compact-sized, and power-efficient white LEDs and photolithographic optical transceivers, in conjunction with indoor environment channel modeling and spatially coded multiple access techniques, to realize secure broadband communications interfaces among sensors.The intellectual merit of this work lies in its potential to provide capacity and quality-of-service superior to conventional radio frequency techniques. This research directly addresses the challenges in obtaining parallel independent optical communications channels that will provide a means of spatial diversity, which, in turn, will result in improved power budget. Furthermore, use of photolithographic (thin film) beam splitters and combiners and white LEDs for transceiver optics pose a challenging, but promising, new area for sensor networks communications.The broader impacts of this research include more efficient and more reliable communication links for facilities that rely upon sensors for collecting/distributing vital information (hospitals, planes, ships, factory plants). Co-existence with RF sensitive devices will make the proposed system robust and attractive for universal usage. Furthermore, this research will contribute to education by being incorporated into lectures on optics and wireless communications science and engineering, providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to obtain multi-disciplinary hands-on experience on issues related to wireless optical communications system design and networking."
15098,NSF,HHS,"Alpha,beta-Amino acid aminomutases catalyze the isomerization of Alpha- to beta-amino acids. One class of aminomutases requires no co-factors to promote isomerization via heterolytic processes involving ionic reaction intermediates, while another requires multiple co-factors, homolytic processes, and radical intermediates. The phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) isolated from Taxus plants is among the set of mutases that lacks co-factor dependency, and the reaction sequence is likely initiated by action of a 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO) prosthetic group, derived by spontaneous cyclization of an ASG amino acid tandem in the active site. After transient removal of the NH3 and H+ from the substrate, these migratory elements are reattached to the phenylpropanoid with retention of configuration at the receiving carbons. The (3R)-configuration of the beta-amino product is opposite to that of the product made by the presumed mechanistically related tyrosine aminomutase (TAM) reaction at pre-equilibrium. The described retention of stereochemistry in the PAM reaction is uncommon, considering that all aminomutases for which the stereochemistry has been examined invert the configuration of carbon receiving the amine group. PAM also displays broad substrate specificity for ring-substituted beta-aryl- and beta-styryl-Alpha-alanines, and thus provides a potential source of unnatural beta-amino acids. Comparing the mechanisms and stereochemical fates of all the 2,3-aminomutases, PAM appears to sort it into a distinct sub-class based on its unique reaction processes. Thus, the long-range goal of this research project is to decipher the molecular and biochemical components of the determinants that govern the PAM mechanism. The specific objectives and timeframe follow: Yrs 1 and 2, assess requirement of the MIO prosthetic group for the function of phenylalanine aminomutase from Taxus sp. Site-specific mutagenesis of the ASG residues comprising the MIO, comparative kinetic assays between wild-type and mutant enzyme will be conducted. Yrs 2 and 3, determine catalytic base that removes the activated benzylic hydrogen. Interaction of the MIO with alpha-phenylalanine is hypothesized to lower the pKa and facilitate the removal of the benzylic hydrogens. Site-specific mutagenesis, comparative kinetics assays and isotopomers of (2S)-alpha-phenylalanine will be employed to address this aim. Yrs 3 and 4, establish the complete stereochemistry of the reverse reaction. The stereochemistry of the migratory hydrogen and amino group in the reverse reaction from (3R)-beta- to (2S)-alpha-phenylalanine is hypothesized to be consistent with that observed for the forward reaction, and will be examined with synthetically derived [2H]-labeled beta-phenylalanines. Yrs 4 and 5, assess kinetics of PAM mutants that have a less encumbered active site. Rational mutation of bulky aliphatic side chains to smaller groups in the PAM active site will be employed to increase active site volume, and the specificity of the mutants will be tested with variously 2', 3', and 4'-substituted aryl alpha-amino acids.Broader Impacts of activities: Educational: In addition to cross training a diverse, multicultural pool of graduate students, this project will integrate research and education through year-round opportunities for undergraduate students. Participants will assist in DNA informatics, biochemical analyses, in vitro assay development, chromatographic and mass spectrometry-based analytical chemistry, enzymology, and synthetic organic chemistry to prepare them for careers in academia and industry. Undergraduate participation and mentoring of ethnic majority and minority students will continue, and the PI continue to recruit students from his 2nd year Organic Chemistry course, which has been the source of previous undergraduate researchers (selected from a pool of the 1000 students). The ultimate goal is to provide fledgling scientists with necessary social context, personal integrity and responsibility to embolden their self-esteem, which provides a foundation of independent thinking and problem-solving skills in Science and Life. Scientific: The project will center on discovering the principles that govern substrate specificity of the Taxol pathway phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) isolated from Taxus spp. Knowledge of the catalytic amino acids and residues involved in substrate binding will hone our ability to predict and test hypotheses of enzymatic function. Understanding these key elements that participate in substrate/enzyme recognition will lay the groundwork to rationally design biocatalysts that can stereoselectively isomerize readily accessible alpha-amino acids to chiral beta-amino acids. The development of such biocatalysts, in vivo or in vitro, would minimize the need to use harmful and environmentally unfriendly solvents that are currently used in synthetic procedures. Ultimately, data on the molecular and structural elements that control substrate specificity will provide invaluable insight into the genetic and biochemical origins of what moderates the retention of NH3 and H+ in the MIO-dependent aminomutase reactions and loss of these groups from the closely related ammonia lyase reactions."

15130,NSF,NSF,The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Andrew Hilier of Iowa State University.  Prof. Hilier's research program focuses on the development of highly sensitive surface plasmon spectroscopic methods for quantitative studies of adsorption of analytes to surfaces. Prof. Hilier and his students will perform detailed experimental and modeling studies to better understand and optimize the conditions needed to facilitate maximum enhancement of light transmission through metal-coated gratings.  The proposed studies will be directly applicable to the development of a greatly improved surface plasmon spectroscopic technique. The study will provide an excellent educational opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to carry out a spectroscopic method development project wit the potential to revolutionize the field of surface plasmon spectroscopy.
15133,NSF,NSF,"The objective of this research is to investigate possible fault location approaches for transmission lines utilizing sparse voltage and current measurements from buses and branches that may be distant from the faulted line. The approach is to derive the measured quantity as an analytical function of the unknown fault location based on the bus-impedance matrix technique, and then to solve the equation for the fault location. This research has the following intellectual merits: It will explore appropriate estimation theories for transmission line fault location, aiming at making fundamental contributions to the areas of power system monitoring, protection and fault analysis. The research will investigate algorithms for both single-circuit and double-circuit lines by employing sparse voltage and current phasors or magnitudes alone. Synchronized phasors from phasor measurement units will be fully exploited. The developed method has the potential to be utilized for online protection purposes, and this could significantly improve distance protection accuracy harnessing only local data.This research will have broader impacts in several areas: First, the developed approach can greatly improve the reliability of the power system, reducing the costs associated with the outage, and enhancing the welfare of the society. Second, the research results will be utilized in the classroom to enrich the curriculum. The underrepresented students, especially women, African Americans and those from Appalachia will be encouraged and recruited to work on the project. Third, the research results will be promptly and broadly disseminated through technical publications and presentations."
15149,NSF,HHS,"The goal of the proposal is to relate period integrals defined on spaces of automorphic forms to special values of L-functions. Specifically the co-PI expects to generalize results of Waldspurger to higher rank by relating period integrals to central values of quadratic base change L-functions. The main tool to be used in this work is the relative trace formula as initiated by Jacquet. The co-PI also plans to explore the use of the relative trace formula in the study of families of L-functions with a view towards understanding how the relative trace formula can be used to attack the subconvexity problem.L-functions provide a connection between the world of automorphic forms and number theory. Special values of L-functions frequently encode important arithmetic information; for example the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture asserts that the L-function of an elliptic curve determines important information about the structure of the elliptic curve. Elliptic curves have become a focal point of much research, from Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem to cryptography."
15180,NSF,HHS,"Like the finite element method, the finite volume method is a discretization technique for solving partial differential equations. Due to the local conservation property and other attractive properties such as robustness with unstructured meshes, the finite volume method is widely used in computational fluid dynamics. Unlike finite element methods, numerical analysis for the finite volume methods is very limited. Only handful of papers analyzing the finite volume approximation for the Navier-Stokes equations can be found. The goal of the proposed research is to establish a complete numerical analysis for a class of the finite volume methods to the Navier-Stokes equations, including establishing stability of the methods; deriving optimal priori error estimates, posteriori error estimates and superconvergence of the solutions; and proving convergence of adaptive procedures. Computational fluid dynamics covers wide range of problems from air flow around airplane to blood flow of human body. The mathematical foundations of any computational fluid dynamics problem are the Navier-Stokes equations.  The finite volume method is the classical numerical method for the problem used most often in commercial software and research codes. The objective of the project is to provide mathematical theory for the finite volume method."
15192,NSF,NSF,"This project concerns computer studies of the solvation of molecules---the attraction and association of the solvent (such as water or salted water) molecules with solute (such as alcohol, protein, etc.) molecules.  The PI develops a new continuum-solvent approach in which an equilibrium solute-solvent interface is defined to minimize a solvation free-energy functional.There are three essential components of this new approach:  (1) a diffuse-interface description of solute-solvent interfaces that incorporates different kinds of molecular interactions;  (2) the molecular mechanics of solute atoms;  and (3) a multiscale method for the solute-solvent molecular interaction and the motion of solute atoms.  All these are closely connected to other studies in applied and computational mathematics such as geometrical motions of surfaces and multiscale computations.  The PI implements several new computational techniques, including the construction of initial solutions, an efficient local method, and stable calculations of free energy.  He also carries out the related numerical analysis on convergence, stability, and errors.  The proposed theory and methods are validated by the comparison with molecular dynamics simulations and known experiments.Molecular interactions determine structures and functions of biological systems.  For example, drug cure diseases because the correct molecular interactions occur.  While much effort has been made to the study of drug designs, it is now widely accepted that new theories must be developed.In this regard, the proposed research is of great interest, since it brings rigorous mathematics into a challenging study of life sciences.  It is hoped that results of this project can be used to better understand why some drugs cure diseases better than others, to make new biomaterial that can better protect our homeland, and to develop sophisticated nanotechnologies that allow us to manipulate molecules for our daily lives.  In addition to potential applications to many areas of national interest, this project creates an education and training program that prepares mathematics students to do research in biologcal science.  This is clearly a needed and challenging task."

15222,NSF,HHS,"Many physical processes of great importance to science and technology require numerical methods that couple modeling of the interactions of individual atoms in small regions with modeling of the interactions among larger sets of atoms (continuum models) in the remaining regions.  An important example is crack growth, where practical predictive models require the accuracy of the detailed interaction of the atoms in a small region near the crack tip, along with the efficiency of continuum modeling in the larger surrounding material.Although the greatest accuracy could be achieved by a computer simulation of the interactions of all of the atoms in the material, the large number of atoms in the material makes this approach infeasible for even the fastest computers.  The quasicontinuum method can make possible such simulations without sacrificing the accuracy needed for reliable prediction by coupling an atomistic model in the neighborhood of the crack tip with a continuum model in the surrounding material.  The continuum model achieves the desired accuracy with a major reduction in computational work by replacing the large numbers of atoms in selected regions with representative atoms.The principal investigator proposes to develop analysis and adaptive algorithms for quasicontinuum methods that will ensure their reliability and improve their efficiency.  Theory and rigorous numerical experiments will be developed to determine the most accurate and efficient atomistic-continuum coupling.  The development of the quasicontinuum method has the potential to facilitate the design of new materials better able to resist failure and having other properties important for science and technology."
15268,NSF,HHS,"We are proposing to hold a workshop on Numerical Modeling of Mantle and Lithospheric Dynamics to build on the success of the 2005 Boulder workshop on Mantle Convection. This workshop will be broader in terms of audience than the Boulder workshop in that we will bring together both the mantle convection and lithospheric dynamics communities. We wish to discuss scientific advances and, importantly, technical and scientific issues related to the quantitative modeling of the origin and evolution of the mantle-lithosphere system. Recent developments in cluster computing, tera-scale resources, and software support and code-sharing efforts of the CIG have brought about major opportunities for scientific progress, such as the prospect of truly combining lithospheric-scale deformation models with mantle convection computations. However, several current science issues remain unresolved and understanding the dynamics of these in a predictive, quantitative sense, is intimately connected to computational issues, for example: How can we efficiently model thermo-chemical convection numerically, in spherical geometries, with adequate treatment of entrainment? How can we incorporate faulted and moving plate boundaries in spherical geometry, and study regionally realistic subduction system evolution? How can we accurately incorporate strain localization and large viscosity variations, and what are the appropriate macroscopic descriptions for sub-scale processes? The workshop will be held over three days on July 9-11, 2008 at U.C. Davis. The workshop conveners have worked together to propose a diverse and stimulating group of speakers and topics. The conference format includes a range of keynote and workshop style presentations, with ample room for poster viewing and structured, as well as unstructured, discussion. This workshop will have several broader impacts beyond advancing numerical modeling methods in the mantle and lithospheric dynamics communities. First, it will serve to train graduate students and researchers in fundamental methods used in numerical modeling. One special session each afternoon is reserved for the specific purpose of teaching the fundamentals of some of the most important numerical methods already in use or anticipated to hold great potential for the mantle convection and lithospheric dynamics communities. Second, the workshop will serve to strengthen the new and growing community of lithospheric-dynamics modelers in the US. Finally, the workshop will facilitate starting collaborations between mantle dynamics and lithospheric dynamics modelers."
15276,NSF,HHS,"CBET-0836365Sandeep Anihotri, University of Tennessee KnoxvilleThe objective of this research is to test whether ozone is reactive with nanocarbons when it is in low concentrations similar to those found in clean to slightly-polluted atmosphere. Intellectual MeritThis study will help determine the fate of nanocarbons after being released into the air. For example, carbon nanotubes are manufactured nanomaterials with potential use in electronic devices and health care. They are powdery and fluffy materials, and even a gentle movement of air or static charge can disperse them in the air. Their excellent physicochemical properties, such as lightweight, nanoscaled fibrous structure and resistance to chemical reactivity, might also impart asbestos-like toxicity and CFC-like persistence in the atmosphere. Despite ever increasing reports of advances in nanotube manufacturing, there is limited information relating to the fate and transformations of nanocarbons after being released in the air. This research will help find the key to unlocking the fate of nanocarbons in atmosphere. Broader Impacts: (i) This study will be important for life cycle assessment of air-borne carbon nanotubes. It will provide the much needed scientific and practical information on interaction of nanotubes in the atmosphere. It will reveal, for the first time, if the atmosphere is capable of partially oxidizing these nanomaterials or degrading them completely into common, less harmful pollutants, say CO and CO2. (ii) Nanocarbons are generally considered inert in nature. This research will question the shelf-life of nanocarbons. The study is also relevant to the electronics industry as it will help identify the extent to which the properties of a nanotube based electronic device might change as a result of the exposure to ambient air. (iii) One graduate student will receive training here. Results from this research will also be incorporated into the PI's teaching activities for courses such as introduction to air and waste management and advanced concepts of air pollution engineering and control. Underrepresented minority students will be involved in the research."
15282,NSF,HHS,"Variations in the intensity of the geomagnetic field are connected to the geodynamo in the Earth's core, and the history of these variations can provide information on the evolution of the core and the core-mantle boundary. However, to acquire reliable data on paleointensity one must avoid many pitfalls. Efforts to develop more reliable paleointensity methods are hampered by our poor understanding of how the field is recorded in all but the smallest crystals. In particular, we know almost nothing about how the recording process is affected by dislocations. Dislocations are imperfections that impose internal stresses on a crystal. These stresses couple with the magnetization. There is good reason to expect that dislocations are common in the most important minerals for paleomagnetism, submicron ferromagnetic crystals, but there is almost no hard evidence for their presence. Nor is anything known about the effect they would have on the magnetic properties in such crystals. We propose to make a major advance in this knowledge using both experiment and theory. Samples from a variety of geologic settings, as well as synthetic magnetite samples, will be examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the dislocations. We will calculate the stress fields around dislocations, taking advantage of a theoretical breakthrough at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories. The stress fields will be incorporated in a numerical micromagnetic model to calculate the coupling between dislocations and magnetization. The micromagnetic model will be used to model the acquisition of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) as minerals cool. It will incorporate realistic grain sizes and shapes, as well as crystallographic dislocation geometries, determined from the TEM measurements. The model will be used to calculate the effect of dislocations on (1) magnetic hysteresis as a function of temperature, (2) low temperature demagnetization and (3) TRM acquisition. We will attempt to reproduce a variety of anomalous results that have been reported for TRM experiments in large magnetite crystals, and we will investigate various protocols for measuring paleointensity experiments. This work should lead to a better understanding of the protocols and better paleointensity methods. This work will include the first systematic search for dislocations in small magnetite crystals, the first calculations of stress fields around dislocations in finite crystals, and the first calculations of the fine-scale coupling between dislocations and magnetization in any material. It also involves the first unconstrained physical model of TRM for crystals with nonuniform magnetization. It may lead to better paleointensity methods and should also be important to applications of environmental magnetism. These advances are made possible by a new partnership between two university scientists (one of whom is a Beginning Investigator) and a researcher at a government laboratory. This partnership has great potential for future studies of the interaction between stress and magnetization."
15293,NSF,HHS,"This research will investigate how stream acidification caused by acid rain influences the biological removal of nitrogen from surface waters. Understanding environmental controls on nitrogen uptake is essential as human activities continue to increase stream concentrations of nitrogen pollutants. While stream acidification is known to have negative effects on fish and invertebrate communities, there is little understanding of acid effects on nitrogen cycling. The investigators will study nine streams in Shenandoah National Park, VA, that differ in chronic pH to infer how nitrogen uptake processes change with acidification over time.The researchers use a basic concept of stress response - a shift in resource allocation away from growth and towards maintenance - to guide investigations at both organismal and ecosystem scales. Laboratory experiments are designed to measure biomass-specific rates of nitrogen uptake, respiration, and enzyme activity by leaf biofilms from all streams. Isotopic techniques will be used to measure the nitrogen demand of streams in situ, and these rates will be combined with whole-stream rates of respiration and microbial biomass in an effort to interpret ecosystem behavior in the physiological context of stress response. Finally, the investigators will use isotopic techniques in four streams along the pH gradient to measure nitrogen demand under experimentally-increased levels of nitrogen concentration to predict future stream uptake potential."
15322,NSF,HHS,"This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Viktor N. Nemykin of the University of Minnesota - Duluth to design and characterize new porphyrins and tetraazaporphyrins directly connected to redox-active transition metal centers.  A series of porphyrins with meso-ferrocene or ruthenocene units will be synthesized along with tetraazporphyrins with ferrocene units connected or fused to the macrocycle.  Systematic investigations will vary the nature of the metal ions incorporated into the porphyrin ring, the number and mutual orientations of the appended metallocene fragments, the nature of the linkers between the metallocenes and porphyrins, and the extent of rotational freedom of the metallocenes.  The systems may demonstrate mixed valence and electron migration properties that are useful for high-density molecular information storage systems.  The specifically designed, modular character of the project is especially suitable for the undergraduate researchers who will take part in the research.

15333,NSF,NSF,"The purpose of this conference proposal is to increase communication and dissemination of research between the basic sciences of judgment and decision making (JDM) and the applied science of medical decision making (MDM). Despite common roots, there are important differences between JDM and MDM as currently studied and practiced. While researchers in each field are often methodologists, the JDM community has focused the majority of its attention on the development and testing of theories of human decision making, and the MDM community has focused its work on the application of normative models of decision making to policy decisions and the development and refinement of prescriptive tools for decision making by patients and health professionals. Each field could be enriched by increased academic interchange. The vehicle for this interchange is an innovative exchange of symposia between the 2008 annual meetings of the Society for Judgment and Decision Making (SJDM) and the Society for Medical Decision Making(SMDM) and subsequent dissemination of the symposium presentations. Top researchers in JDM will be selected through a peer-review process to present a symposium at SMDM entitled  Current Developments in Judgment and Decision Making ; top researchers in MDM will be selected through a peer-review process to present a symposium at SJDM entitled  Application and Innovation: Lessons from Medical Decision Making .

15388,NSF,NSF,"Technical Description. This grant will enable the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) to acquire a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV) for research and educational use. The SLDV enables noncontact (remote) measurement and mapping of the dynamic deflections of a wide-range of structures and systems. By employing laser technology and a computer software driven data acquisition system, the instrument can measure velocities at very low levels (Significance & Impact. Acquiring the SLDV will advance research at UIC on numerous multidisciplinary fronts important to society, spanning from civil infrastructure and transportation system safety to medical diagnoses, tissue engineering and biomedical implants. The proposed research using the SLDV will leverage its unique combination of qualities: precision, portability, noninvasiveness, and capability for making noncontact measurements. These features enable its use in many critical applications and make it an ideal gold standard for calibration and validation of other less expensive and alternative sensor array techniques being pioneered by the assembled multidisciplinary research team. Wide use of the SLDV, including hands-on training, in undergraduate and graduate instructional courses, will help make these students better engineers, preparing them for challenges they will face with real world problems and enabling them to compete globally in their respective technical fields.

15448,NSF,HHS,"Rare Disasters and Exchange Rates, Proposal Number 0820517by Emmanuel Farhi (Harvard and NBER) and Xavier Gabaix (NYU and NBER)    This proposal contains a new model of exchange rates which offers a solution of the forward premium puzzle. The puzzle is due to investing in high interest rate currencies (the  carry trade ) yielding much more than warranted by the underlying risk differential with low-interest currencies. The explanation combines two ingredients: the possibility of rare economic disasters, and an asset view of the exchange rate.    The model is frictionless, has complete markets, works for an arbitrary number of countries, and derives in closed form the values of exchange rates, stocks, and bonds. In the model, rare worldwide disasters can occur and affect each country's productivity. Each country's exposure to disaster risk varies over time according to a mean-reverting process. Risky countries command high risk premia: they feature a depreciated exchange rate and a high interest rate. As their risk premium mean reverts, their exchange rate appreciates. Therefore, currencies of high interest rate countries appreciate on average.    To make the notion of disaster risk more implementable, the proposals shows how options prices can in principle uncover latent disaster risk, and help forecast exchange rate movements.    Calibration of the model yields quantitatively realistic values for the volatility of the exchange rate, the formerly unexpected sign of the regression coefficients, and near-random walk exchange rate dynamics. The project has the following distinctive features.    (i) It generates easily two central features of the data, namely  excess volatility  of exchange rates, and the (solution to the)  forward premium puzzle.     (ii) The model has a novel analytical structure, based on the ideas of rare disasters, and the newly-developed class of  linearity-generating processes.  This makes the model very tractable: Exchange rates, stocks and bonds prices can be obtained from it in exact closed forms in a frictionless setup. The framework can serve as a new multi-purpose model for international macroeconomics.    (iii) The model makes new testable predictions: Currencies with high crash premiums should subsequently appreciate. In addition, the model yields a series of predictions about the joint behavior of exchange rates and the prices of  bonds, options and stocks across countries.    The proposed research offers a way to understand the impact of exchange rate pegging. This is particularly relevant, as a large fraction of emerging countries (e.g., China) do peg their currency. To analyze pegs, one needs a model that generates a volatile exchange rate in absence of a peg like the model here provided.Last not least, the projects theory delineates how the latent importance of large disasters can be detected in asset prices."
15449,NSF,NSF,"This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal aims to elucidate the impact of processing parameters on the performance of thin-film encapsulation layers used in organic electronics, leading to new architectures with improved performance.  These films act as permeation barriers to prevent the exposure of organic electronics to atmospheric water vapor and oxygen which are detrimental to their performance.  Vacuum deposition of thin-film barriers will be performed using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and combinations of the two techniques.   Recent results have shown that unique combinations of ALD and PECVD processing may yield ultrahigh barrier films with submicron thickness and improved processing speeds.  In this work, we will explore the impact of processing temperature, plasma power and frequency, and cycle times on the deposition of these thin film encapsulation layers. By varying these parameters, it will be possible to control both barrier and mechanical properties of the encapsulation films.  Diffusion coefficients of the films will be determined using quartz crystal microbalance testing while water vapor transmission rates through the films will be determined using Ca corrosion testing.  Mechanical properties will be investigated using flexure testing, nanoindentation, and atomic force microscopy.  Microstructural analysis will be performed using high resolution SEM and FIB microscopy.If successful, this exploratory grant will yield a new architecture for encapsulating organic electronics which is thinner and more mechanically robust than state of the art encapsulation films.  An understanding of the role of processing parameters on thin film properties will provide a framework for optimizing the encapsulation films of other compositions.  Moreover, the combined PECVD/ALD method will be tuned to provide ultrahigh barrier performance with improvements in deposition rates which is necessary for future implementation in mass manufacturing of flexible organic electronics."
15453,NSF,HHS,"This renewal award to SUNY Stony Brook by the Solid State Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research is aimed at understanding how electrode materials and anionic conductors function under operating conditions.  With this project, Professor Grey will be building, testing and utilizing a NMR probe designed to acquire NMR spectra of functioning and intact lithium-ion batteries. Lithiated silicon anode materials, which are in metastable crystalline phase, will be studied using a combination of in and ex-situ 7Li and 29Si Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and pair distribution function analysis of x-ray and neutron scattering. A second application involves the investigation of nanoparticles of layered materials such as LixCoO2, to determine the effect that size and morphology have on the various phase transitions that occur on charging this material, and the stability of the charged materials in the electrolyte.  Nanoparticulate cathode materials are expected to have applications in high power batteries in, for example, hybrid electric or electric vehicles.  The role of local structures on long-range anionic conductivity of electrode materials such as perovskite (such as LaGaO3) and browmillerite (such as Ba2In2O5) along with materials that can be viewed as intermediates between these end-number structures will also be studied as the second part of this study.  Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy (e.g., 71Ga, 89Y NMR) of the B sites will be used to determine the coordination environments of the cations as a function of temperature, while 17¬O NMR spectroscopy will be used to determine the mobility of the oxide ions in different local environments of the electrode materials.The materials investigated by this program will have significant technological relevance for the design of the next generation of materials for use in Lithium ion batteries and fuel cells.  The use of silicon as an anode material for a Lithium ion batteries is likely to be of great commercial interest. In addition, the project will provide fundamental insight in the design and development of the next generation of materials for energy sources, improved batteries and fuel cells. Graduate, undergraduate and high students working in this project through their research and classroom experiences will be trained in sophisticated techniques with an appreciation to their use to solve important technical problems."

15553,NSF,HHS,"The proposed work involves computer explorations and transfer of information across several mathematical boundaries, from Representation Theory to the Theory Special Functions and then to Combinatorics. The connection between Representation Theory and the Theory of Special functions is provided by a process that goes back to Frobenius. Combinatorics plays a role in that certain important integers such as dimensions and multiplicities are obtained by counting tableaux, paths, trees, etc. These connections provide an invaluable vehicle of discovery, since results and mechanisms which may be obvious in one of these areas often translate into highly  non trivial and unexpected facts in one of the other areas. The power of the combinatorial viewpoint should be easily understood  from the truism `` A picture is worth a thousand words''. Combinatorial interpretations translate mathematical information be it algebraic, analytical, logical or otherwise into visual information. The proposed activities involve computation of Kronecker coefficients, determination of Hilbert series, constructions of explicit basic sets of rings of invariants, factorization of certain algebras as free modules over rings of invariants,  decompositions of graded representations into their irreducible constituents. These are all activities that have a bearing in several branches of Mathematics and Physics. All the proposed research lies in areas which are particularly suitable to computer experimentation. Experience  shows that, in this setting, even students with limited background can experience the joy of non trivial discovery. Kronecker coefficients, which are integers yielding the multiplicities of irreducibles in tensor products of representations, are difficult to compute directly from their original definition. New methodology that is being developped by the proposer in collaboration with A. Goupil and M. Zabrocki obtains polynomial generating functions of these coefficients, from which the coefficients themselves can be easily extracted. Constructing these  Kronecker ``polynomials`` and seeking for their combinatorial interpretation will be one of the activities to be carried out under this grant. Hilbert series of graded vector spaces are generating functions of dimensions of the successive homogeneous components of these vector spaces. The proposed reseach will develop algorithms for the calculation of Hilbert series of rings of invariants. Invariants are polynomials which remain unchanged under the action of certain groups of matrices. Hilbert series are computed primarily to obtain information useful in the construction  of  basic sets of invariants.  The proposer in collaboration with N. Wallach  explored and expanded a way to obtain Hilbert series by constant term algorithms. Subsequent collaboration by the proposer with G. Xin succeeded in refining these algorithms to the extent that certain Hilbert series that hiterto required hours of computer time were recently obtained in a few seconds. The acquisition of explicit formulas and when not available the development of efficient algorithms yielding mathematical constructs are the primary activities that will be carried out under this grant. Significant success in these endeavours should be beneficial to other researchers in the applied sciences."
15562,NSF,NSF,"New statistical and analytical methods will be developed to study regulatory role of histone modifications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gene activities in eukaryotic cells are concertedly regulated by transcription factors and chromatin structure. The basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, an octamer containing two copies each of four core histone proteins. While nucleosome occupancy in promoter regions typically occludes transcription factor binding, thereby repressing global gene expression, the role of histone modification is more complex. Histone tails can be modified in various ways, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. Even the regulatory role of histone acetylation, the best characterized modification to date, is still not fully understood. Mass spectral and genome-wide microarray data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have offered new opportunities for investigators to evaluate the regulatory effects of histone modifications. The investigators will develop statistical methods for identifying target genes of histone modifications and associated DNA sequence features of histone modifications. The investigators will also develop computational and statistical methods for predicting histone modifications and their interactions. Experimental data are noisy and high dimensional, which renders many tradition statistical methods ineffective. How to build prediction models with only a small set of informative variables adds another layer of complexity. New statistical methods will be developed to surmount the challenges.  The proposed methods lead to a statistical framework for integrating multiple types of proteomic and genomic data. A complete framework for such integration has not been developed and tested in the statistics and computational biology literature.  The proposed method can produce innovative methodologies for analyzing very large amounts of heterogeneous data, suggest new lines of quantitative investigations in systems biology, and offer opportunities for students to participant in inter-disciplinary research."
15576,NSF,HHS,"Technical: This project aims for greater understanding, development, and optical characterization of new metallodielectric nano-composite materials. Dispersion of the dielectric permittivity, as arising from composition, structure and symmetry is a primary issue of concern, because it enables control, creation and detection of optical information, since new dispersive phenomena are now known to arise in  micro and nanostructured materials. The approach addresses such dispersive response in selection of nanostructured metallodielectric composite materials, referred to as metamaterials, and study of linear optical response of metallodielectric composites in the context of three fundamentally distinct dispersion management protocols: (i) Starting with nanostructured composites, effective material permittivities will be measured, delineating their dependence on symmetry, scale and order. (ii) At the meso-scale, plasmon mode-coupling in quasi two-dimensional metallodielectric photonic crystals will be studied in the context of a coherently-induced transparency. (iii) At the material level, coupling of the metallodielectric structures to a resonant gain medium will allow active control over metamaterial dispersion. The integrated results of this study are expected to result in a more comprehensive and fundamental understanding of dispersion management in both active and passive metamaterials. Since the project addresses fundamental questions of light-matter interactions in nanoscale plasmonic systems, results and knowledge gained will be relevant to understanding signal manipulation in sub-diffraction volumes in the presence of strong dispersion. Such understanding is expected to have impact in fields such as light harvesting, nanoscale signal routing and storage, high-resolution imaging systems and active plasmonic devices.Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science with high technological relevance. Current development of photonic devices capable of manipulating optical information may substantially impact advancement of present and future optical technologies. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature, offering collaborative opportunities for all participating students. A goal is to make known the many fascinating aspects of materials science by exposing university students of all levels to research and multi-disciplinary scientific work. At the undergraduate level the aim is to expand avenues for learning by offering a variety of course and research opportunities. At the graduate level the project addresses involvement and development of existing educational and internship programs, both in materials science and optics."
15604,NSF,NSF,"Cancer research is at a critical juncture in the interaction of mathematical and biological knowledge for understanding cancer.  Mathematical modeling of cancer dynamics has improved to such an extent that we are at a point where mathematical models can be used to probe cancer etiology and progression and guide experimental research in an informed manner. The combination of multi-scale mathematical modeling techniques and immense computing power affords the possibility of integrating basic cancer biology through genetic, sub-cellular, cellular, tissue, and epidemiologic levels.  The continuation of recent research progress in this interdisciplinary field requires the training of young researchers to develop these specialized skills. This two-month program of workshops will help to produce an energetic community of young researchers in this field.The plan of this research program is the organization of multidisciplinary meetings focused on major outstanding problems in oncology. The series of meetings will combine the expertise and intellectual resources of three leading institutes: the Fields Institute in Toronto, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, and the Vanderbilt Integrative Cancer Biology Center in Nashville.  The direct impact of NSF funding will be the training of a significant number of junior United States researchers (junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students), who will gain the opportunity to participate in the workshops. This interdisciplinary program in oncology will bring together researchers in the mathematical/physical sciences, oncologists and cancer biologists to address a range of challenging problems and topics in cancer research."
15614,NSF,HHS,"Fifty years ago, in a 1957 research announcement for the summer AMS meeting, R. H. Fox and J. Milnor, began their influential collaboration with the title, `Singularities of 2-spheres in 4-space and equivalence of knots.'  Here they introduced the seminal idea that the concordance class of the link of a singularity obstructs its removal.  Both concordance of knots, and the motivating goal of understanding singularities remain central to topology and algebraic geometry.  A conference at Brandeis University will be held on June 2-5, 2008, to bring together a variety of researchers and students in geometric topology whose work connects to this fundamental idea.  The conference will fertilize new research directions by encouraging  mathematical interaction and collaboration.   A substantial number of young investigators will be invited to give them exposure, broaden their perspective, and allow them to get to know each other and the more senior members of these fields.  There will be approximately twenty invited addresses, and ample time will be set aside for  interaction among the attendees.   The conference will also honor the  memory of Jerome Levine, a pioneer and key contributor to the field.A knot is a non-intersecting closed curve in three dimensional space.  By closed, one means that if one travels along the curve, originating from any point on the curve, one eventually returns to the point of origin.  A foundational subject to the field of topology, knot theory interacts with important areas in geometry, biology, and physics as well.  The Knot concordance group measures wrinkles, or singularities, of surfaces in four dimensional space, and through this connection, enlightens our understanding of four dimensional shapes. Despite intense effort over the last 50 years, these groups have not been  fully computed.   Recently, new techniques from low-dimensional  topology, including gauge theory, non-commutative algebra, higher- order linking theory, and quantum topology, have resulted in great advances in the study of knot concordance, revealing new structures in the concordance group.  The conference will promote interactions between researchers working on these aspects of knot concordance and engender future research on this fundamental problem."
15676,NSF,NSF,"A grant has been awarded to the University of Utah to obtain a next-generation genome analysis machine such as the Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer.  This sort of equipment uses new methods that allow very large amounts of DNA sequence to be obtained rapidly, and at approximately 1% of the cost of traditional genome centers.  The equipment will support a diverse base of users, and will contribute significantly to many NSF-supported research programs.  In addition, the equipment will also be used for undergraduate education.  The PIs and major users of this equipment will address several different basic research question: (1) Natural Variation and Genome Evolution-  Making sense of biological diversity requires understanding the DNA sequence differences between individuals or strains and how these sequence differences influence phenotypes.  The reduced cost of sequencing using this new technology, and the speed with which DNA sequence data can be obtained, will allow several PIs and major users to obtain high quality genomic sequence data for the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, bacterial endosymbionts, the ninespine stickleback, red fox, and zebra finch.  We anticipate that the genome sequences will allow us to gain insights into modes of evolutionary change, including those that underlie response of organisms to their environments (e.g., drought response in plants). (2) Genetic Networks and Basic Molecular Mechanisms-  A major goal of cellular and developmental biology is to understand how specific genes come to be expressed in specific cell types.  Several PIs and major users are focusing on transcriptional networks and mechanisms of RNA decay, and will use the next-generation sequencer to identify the RNAs that are produced as a result of specific signaling, and the intermediates that accumulate.  The approaches that are possible with the funded instrumentation will allow both qualitative and quantitative analyses at an unprecedented level of detail. (3) Behavioral Genetics and Molecular Characterization of Subtle Mutant Phenotypes- Some genetic variations (mutations) cause very subtle phenotypes, and so traditional approaches like genetic mapping are either difficult or extremely time-intensive.  Nevertheless, such mutations are very informative for understanding the molecular basis of behaviors.  Using the next-generation sequencer, in combination with genetic approaches, will allow rapid identification of the DNA lesions (and genes) underlying behavioral traits.  Initial studies will be performed with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The next-generation sequence analyzer will be placed into a new Genomics Facility in the Biology Department at the University of Utah.  It will be made available to researchers in the Great Basin Region (e.g. Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, and New Mexico).  The Biology Department at the University of considers a hands-on understanding of large genomics datasets to be an essential component of a basic undergraduate education.  Specific plans to incorporate this new equipment and analysis of the resulting data have already been developed for three undergraduate courses."
15683,NSF,HHS,"Proposal No: 811082Title: Robust Performance Characterization in Complex VLSI Design Under Variations PI name: Davoodi, Azadeh Institution: University of Wisconsin-MadisonABSTRACT:Design of Integrated Circuits is highly impacted by the imperfections of the nano-scale manufacturing process. These imperfections translate into variations in the characteristics of devices and their interconnections. These variations tend to become more random and less systematic as technology further scales down into sub-45nm domain. Only partial statistical information might be known about these variations, such as their average, variance and range. Furthermore, depending on the stage in the hierarchical design flow, correlations in the variability of the components on the chip may be partially known. Given this partial information, robust performance estimation is required to obtain more predictability during the design process. A robust prediction should include all scenarios that match with the partially available variability data. The PI proposes to investigate the novel applications of two statistical and optimization-based approaches for robust modeling of the performance of VLSI circuits. The PI suggests investigating the applicability of these approaches for large circuit sizes and large number of die-to-die and within-die variations at different stages of the design flow.Successful implementation of the proposed research allows a more predictable design flow which can make a significant contribution in the development of next generation Integrated Circuits by shortening design cycles, thereby allowing a faster time-to-market. Reducing the time-to-market can prevent losses of 5-10% magnitude per month in major manufacturing industries. In addition, the PI plans development of a graduate-level course which will likely appeal to the students outside the Computer Engineering area towards meeting their secondary and minor area requirements, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This research will catalyze the PI?s efforts to increase the diversity in engineering by encouraging women to study computer engineering and choose it as a career, either at industry or academia."
15698,NSF,HHS,"There is a broad consensus among climate models that a warming world will lead to a drier climate over most of the subtropical United States. Yet, observational evidence suggests that total precipitation and stream flow have increased across the United States over the last several decades with the largest increases generally observed in fall across the central United States. Identification of origins for the observed precipitation trends may be complicated by an apparent fall dry bias in current climate models. Most coupled climate models significantly underestimate precipitation over the Mississippi basin during fall, limiting our ability to skillfully predict future changes in precipitation or attribute the recently observed trends to anthropogenic origins. This apparent inconsistency between observed trends in fall precipitation and the dry bias in climate models motivates the Principal Investigators (PIs) to better understand and identify the dominant mechanisms that produce trends and variations in fall precipitation. The relationship between atmospheric circulations and surface climate over the United States in winter and summer has been the subject of many observational and modeling studies. Relatively little attention has been paid to fall precipitation, limiting our knowledge of the space-time variations and predictability of fall climate. A key goal of this research is to understand the long-term trend and the decadal variability of fall precipitation over the central United States. To achieve this goal, the PIs will focus on three broad questions: (a) What mechanisms are important to produce trends and decadal variations in fall precipitation across the central United States and how well are they represented in current generation climate models? (b) In what ways and why these mechanisms are particularly dominant in fall and not in other seasons? (c) Can the physical linkages between decadal variations in fall precipitation and Pacific or Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST) be identified? The PIs will begin by expanding their ongoing observational data analyses and existing results from the literature to further establish the associational link among fall precipitation variations, circulation anomalies, and boundary forcing. Then, they will attempt to identify possible physical mechanisms that can explain the observed correlation and associational links. A main outcome of this research will be a better understanding and identification of the dominant atmospheric processes responsible for the spatially coherent trends and decadal variations in fall precipitation and how they differ from other seasons. This research would address questions related to origin and nature of fall precipitation variability and trends at the seasonal, inter-annual, and decadal time scales. Most of the existing studies consider precipitation variations in winter and summer seasons only. The fall transition season was not considered separately in any of the future climate change assessments, such as those by the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change (IPCC). Results from this research will provide new insight on why a large increase in precipitation is primarily observed in the central United States in fall and why current climate models are unable to capture this trend. This collaborative partnership between the Tufts University and Columbia University builds on mutually synergistic expertise in water cycle research, atmospheric dynamics, and hydrology. This partnership will be further strengthened through co-advising of PhD students and involvement of undergraduate students through summer internships. The PIs will integrate findings from this research to develop an interactive multimedia education module on Precipitation Variations over the United States to be used as a three-week teaching instrument for our dual-level (senior undergraduates and first year graduate students) course on Environmental Signal Processing. They will present their results in national conferences and archival journals and publish their findings in diverse media formats so they will be readily available to journalists, teachers and the general public."
15702,NSF,NSF,"The research objective of this award is to pattern, at the nanoscale, functional nanomaterials for electronics and sensing applications.  The patterning will be accomplished using a novel, elastic nanoimprinter, as opposed to the traditional rigid nanoimprinters, which greatly alleviates the need for precision alignment between stamper and substrate, and allows multi-layer nanoimprinting.  This new manufacturing method makes possible the nanopatterning of functional nanomaterials such as metal conductive traces synthesized from nanoparticles.  These metal conductive traces are first deposited as a nanoparticle ink, patterned by a nanostamper, and subsequently sintered at low temperatures to form fully continuous, low-resistance metal traces that are fully compatible with a wide variety of polymer substrates and active materials.  The approach taken in this research is to 1) characterize the fluidic and thermal properties of nanoparticle solutions (nanoparticle inks), 2) characterize the mechanical properties of nanoimprinting stamps for improved fidelity nanopatterning, 3) conduct both experiments and theoretical analysis of thermal sintering of nanoparticles, 4) make a quantitative analysis of the adhesion between the nanoimprinted features and substrates, 5) perform an analysis of the influence of mechanical deformation on the performance of nanoimprinted materials and 6) develop multi-layer, multi-material nanoimprinting. If successful, the benefits and broad impact of this research will be a new, low-cost, high-performance manufacturing technology that will eliminate the need for both vacuum and lift-off processes. Nanoimprinting via elastic stampers also allows multi-layer materials to be imprinted.  This new manufacturing technology will make possible major cost reductions and major quality improvements in flat panel displays, large area electronics, electronics on flexible substrates.  Other benefits include new technologies for the creation of biodetection circuits."
15733,NSF,NSF,"Last Modified Date:  05/13/08  Last Modified By:  Anna Kerttula de Echave      Abstract Co-Investigators Christyann Darwent (Department of Anthropology, University of California-Davis) and Genevieve LeMoine (Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum, Bowdoin College) will undertake archaeological excavation at two Thule/Inughuit sites in the summers of 2008 and 2009. The goal is to investigate the prehistoric-historic transition in this region, and to gain an understanding of this period of key culture contact and environmental change. The prehistoric-historic transition here dates to the 19th century. Sporadic contact with Euro-Americans began in 1818 when John Ross first anchored off Cape York, and became increasingly frequent after 1850. At the same time, (ca. 1860) the Inughuit assimilated into their society a group of migrants from Baffin Island. Both of these processes had major and lasting impacts on Inughuit society, and because both of them involved introducing, or re-introducing, important technologies, they are amenable to archaeological investigation. Technological studies, using a variety of approaches, will be used to understand how the Inughuit adopted new tools and materials into their activities, and what impact such changes had on their lives. The nineteenth century also saw the end of the Little Ice Age, with increased warming accompanied by as-yet undocumented changes in the abundance and distribution of plants and animals. Studies of both economically important animals and the insect fauna of the sites will address questions of the timing and scope of these changes, as well as the Inughuit?s responses to them. Sites have been selected on the basis of surveys conducted by the team in 2004 and 2005. In 2008 the team will excavate late-prehistoric/early historic winter dwellings at Cape Grinnell, a site first identified by Elisha Kent Kane in the1850s as having recently abandoned houses. In 2009 the research team will focus its efforts on Qaqaitsut, a winter village, occupied from ca. AD 1200 to as recently as the 1980s. Houses and adjacent middens will be excavated. They will also map both of these multi-component sites in detail. At Cape Grinnell, a geomorphological study will help the team understand the development of beach ridges, which have been occupied for over 4000 years. The investigators will be addressing questions of basic culture history; culture contact, both between indigenous groups and between Euro-Americans and Inuit; adaptation to the changing polar environment; and mammalian biogeography. This project is part of NSF?s investment in International Polar Year research. The project is an international collaborative one with researchers from the United States, Canada, Denmark and Greenland (including members of the local Inughuit communities)."

Projects include- Byzantine fault tolerance for long-running, nondeterministic systems,- Performability in wireless mobile networks, and- Hybrid emulation of wireless sensor networks.Novel methods are sought for providing Byzantine fault tolerance to long-running, nondeterministic distributed systems. Performance in highly stressed mobile wireless network is investigated in terms of high node mobility and strong interference, as is understanding of nodes? boundary behavior under extreme conditions seeking novel methods to survive the stress via cooperation. Lastly, a novel framework for hybrid emulation of wireless sensor networks is proposed to enable affordable experimentation at scale. The instrumentation consists of a cluster of servers connected by a managed high-speed switch forming a dynamically-configurable distributed computing testbed, servers to join the PlanetLab Consortium, and networking equipment to connect the testbed with an existing wireless network testbed. Broader Impacts:This project should have broad impact on security and dependability education. The tools and methodologies produced will be used by collaborators both in academia and industry (e.g., factory automation and highway work-zone safety).  The infrastructure and outcomes will be integrated with the education curriculum; courses on fault tolerant computing and performance analysis will be developed.

15762,NSF,NSF,"Glacier ice worms (Mesenchytraeus solifugus) are the largest and most complex animals in which biological processes (e.g., growth, reproduction, metabolism, etc.) occur at zero degrees centigrade and below.  Ice worms inhabit glaciers and ice fields ranging from central Oregon to Alaska, and a related species has been reported in Tibet. In this project, the researchers will collect worm specimens from strategic geographic regions (e.g., British Columbia, Tibet) to establish evolutionary relationships between distant ice worm populations and their temperate relatives (i.e., Mesenchytraeus species that typically occupy streams and lakes).  By comparing specific DNA sequences (i.e., mitochondrial and ribosomal RNA genes), the investigators hope to reconstruct the evolutionary history of ice worms in North America and Asia.  Additionally, the process of energy production in ice worms will be examined in detail. Previous studies demonstrate that ice worms have unusually high steady-state energy levels that may contribute to their cold temperature survival abilities. They hypothesize that a few key enzymes (i.e, AMP phosphatase, AMP deaminase) will be turned off in ice worms, while others (e.g., adenylosuccinate lyase) may display relatively enhanced activity?in combination, these changes may be necessary and sufficient to maintain elevated energy levels in ice worms.  Collectively, these analyses will provide species history information on an organism that has survived past cycles of global climate change but is now directly threatened by the changing global climate, and will also shed light on the fundamentals of bioenergetics at low physiological temperatures. The project will integrate participants ranging from traditional students to K-12 teachers, to collect ice worms in the field and study them in the laboratory. Research objectives will be integrated into a Glacier Biology course at Alaska Pacific University, and laboratory courses at Rutgers University."
15767,NSF,HHS,"The work supported by this award has three main components addressing some central concerns in the mathematical analysis of financial problems, specifically credit risk, construction and calibration of measures of risk, and asymptotic approximations for derivatives valuation problems. The first component analyzes option prices, or implied volatility surfaces, in the presence of multiscale stochastic volatility, combining singular and regular perturbation expansions from fast and slow volatility factors, and a WKB-type analysis for the short-time behaviour.  The second component studies the inference of risk measures from market data. Under many standard financial models, good time-consistent convex risk measures are characterized by solutions of backward stochastic differential equations and quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), for which calibration is an inverse problem. The goal is design of asymptotic and numerical methods to translate market values of instruments contingent on extreme events into risk measures.  The third component is to develop new models and algorithms for valuing and managing credit risk. The class of top-down models is a convenient macroscopic description of the number of defaults, and our study involves asymptotics for wave-type PDEs with random coefficients. The relationship with constituent bottom-up (microscopic) models needs to be understood, and the challenge is to design effective approximations to pass between the two levels of detail.This research project develops mathematical and computational tools for understanding and modeling credit risk and volatilities in extreme regimes, and seeks to construct appropriate risk measures. The broad goal is better quantitative assessment and management of market volatility and default risk, especially in times of heavy turmoil like the present. This is particularly important given that poor understanding and weak regulation of risks related to credit-linked instruments allowed untamed speculation and securitization thatspurred the onset of the current crisis. While such re-insurance products can be used for the good, their design and use has to be informed by tools of stochastic analysis and statistics. This research will contribute to this tool set."
15777,NSF,HHS,"Safety first! Safety is the first goal in any work process. To finish a construction project, resources such as workers, large machines, and materials are needed. These resources frequently move from one location to another location on the construction site. In this process, however, some very common accidents occur. The most common of these include falls from higher levels, e.g. workers falling from scaffolding or into holes in the ground, or workers being hit by larger machines. Overall, for the last 13 years the United States construction industry has experienced over 1,000 fatalities annually, accounting for more than 25% of all industry workplace fatalities. The problem of safety is much bigger when considering developing countries such as India and China, where construction is proceeding at a frantic pace. To solve it, this research aims to improve construction worker safety by creating methods to integrate new sensing technologies on the job site that can automatically detect and warn workers early enough before getting hurt. These technologies include optical systems, such as cameras or lasers, and wireless systems, such as radio based tagging for detection and tracking of workers, machines, and materials. This research will establish automated site monitoring and recording as an integral part of construction safety management. Additionally, this research will also provide a new set of tools for training construction workers and construction educators in best practices for worker safety at today's increasingly complex construction sites. This research will lead to new training materials and practices that will have a direct impact on worker safety. Because of the inherent diversity of the construction labor pool, this research will have broad impact on labor safety and training for minority groups as well. This research will actively include students with interest in civil, electrical, and computational engineering."

15832,NSF,NSF,"Cholak will study a range of topics in computability theory. All of the Cholak's projects are motivated by the goal of understanding the relationship between computability and definability.  For example, Cholak studies automorphisms of the computably enumerable sets.  Take two computably enumerable sets A and B; if they are in the same orbit then A and B satisfy the same infinitary formulas.  Conversely, if A and B satisfy the same infinitary formulas then A and B are in the same orbit.  One of the structures that Cholak will continue to explore is the collection of all computably enumerable sets with the inclusion relation. In addition, Cholak will study what is definable in the collection of all effective closed classes of reals under inclusion and also under Medvedev reducibility which is defined via Turing reducibility.  Cholak is also in engaged in other projects involving reverse mathematics and various models of second-order arithmetic, computable structure theory, and effective measure theory and randomness.Cholak works in the area of mathematical logic called computability theory. The central theme in computability theory is the relationship between Turing machines and definability.  Informally, a Turing machine is a computer with unlimited time and memory.  We say a natural number x is accepted by a Turing machine if the Turing machine halts with input x. We say a subset A of the natural numbers is computably enumerable iff there is a Turing machine that accepts x iff x is in A.  A set R is computable iff A and its complement are computably enumerable.  For Cholak, definability or expressibility means formulas, mainly in first-order logic, although many times we will have to move to stronger logics.  The classical result of Post in arithmetic relating computability and definability is that the computably enumerable sets are the sets that can be defined by a formula of the form  there exists a number x such that some computable relation hold of x."
15836,NSF,NSF,"This proposal's main purpose is to investigate an area of mathematics which grew out of the science of interpreting data of large number of measurements.  The basic problem is this: under normal circumstances, when people have to make repeated measurements of some data to draw statistical conclusions, they try to make the measurements at regular intervals, like once every second.  The existing theories usually assume that the measurements are taken _exactly_ at every second.  In reality, measurements are made at every second only approximately.  The proposal's investigations are aimed to look at these possible random perturbations, and try to develop tools to help interpret the obtained data. One of the main motivation for these investigations is the fact that random perturbations may result in a completely different set of data from those one could obtain under the ideal circumstances.  As it may be guessed, many of the problems we face are difficult, and to solve these problems we resort to tools used in several different branches of mathematics."
15841,NSF,NSF,"ABSTRACT  PI Nonacs CoPI Wayne  Proposal #IOS-0808256THE EVOLUTIONARY GENOMICS OF FACULTATIVE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN A TROPICAL SWEAT BEEEvolutionary explanations for altruism have been sought since the time of Darwin, and are still not agreed upon by many researchers.  Cooperation is most extreme within social insect colonies, in which one or a few members (queens) reproduce, and most colony members (workers) forego reproduction to specialize in other tasks.  One explanation for social evolution is based on the similarities between social insect worker behavior and maternal reproductive traits.  The worker caste may have originated in a solitary ancestor when a mutant female exhibited maternal behavior prior to dispersal.  This would have resulted in sibling-directed, instead of offspring-directed care.  If this theory is correct, genes active throughout the reproductive cycle of solitary ancestors should be differentially regulated in workers and queens of social descendants.  An ideal test of this hypothesis requires knowledge of gene expression patterns in representatives of the social and ancestral solitary state.  Fortunately an analogous condition exists in Megalopta genalis bees, where both social and solitary individuals are found simultaneously within the same population.  To analyze differential gene expression, a custom microarray, (a slide containing probes corresponding to approximately 5,000 genes expressed in the M. genalis brain) will be created.   Because sociality in M. genalis is flexible and aseasonal, this proposal represents a better controlled and more informative study than is possible in any species studied to date.  The results will highlight evolutionary pressures consistently important to the origin of eusociality, and have a transformative role in understanding how the social environment affects reproductive behavior.  Broader impacts of the work: The new large-scale genomic resource created within this proposal will be publicly available, and useful to other researchers from many scientific disciplines.  The proposed laboratory work will provide training in cutting edge molecular techniques to undergraduate students through an ongoing UCLA program aimed at increasing minority participation in scientific research."
15849,NSF,NSF,"Pollination is one of the best studied and ecologically most important mutualisms in biology. Pollinators are diverse and vary widely in their behavior and efficiency in pollinating flowers. Many plants have separate sexes, yet it is poorly understood how changes in the pollinator community could differentially affect male, hermaphrodite, and female flowers. Pollinators that eat pollen, for example, may neglect female flowers. Furthermore, the distribution and abundance of pollinators vary over time naturally and as a result of  human activity. Using computer simulations and field experiments, this study will directly measure the consequences of pollinator communities on seed production of female and hermaphrodite Silene vulgaris plants exposed to different groups of pollinators, including pollen collecting bees, nectar collecting moths, and seed eating insects, in North America and in Europe. The intellectual merit of this research is that it will develop our understanding of the consequences of changes in pollinator communities on plant fitness, and our understanding of the conditions that favor plants that are hermaphroditic or which have separate sexes. This study will have broader impacts in several areas. There are potential economic implications because many agricultural crops require insect pollination to produce adequate yields. Computer programs created for this project will also be used to develop freely available educational software modeling pollination processes for use in university biology classes. Finally, this project will develop a graduate student as a scientist and further expand an international collaboration between US and Czech Republic researchers."
15864,NSF,HHS,"This proposal requests funds to help support travel and meeting costs for students and early career scientists at U.S. institutions to the 27th International Conference on Mathematical Geophysics ?Dynamics in Earth Systems: Flow, Fracture, and Waves? to be held in June 15-20, 2008 in Longyearbyen, Norway, on the Spitsbergen Island of the Svalbard Archipelago. The conference website is http://www.fys.uio.no/cmg2008/. This conference brings together Earth scientists from across the disciplines with physicists, applied mathematicians, and computational scientists to discuss advances in mathematical and computational techniques for understanding properties and processes in the Earth. This year?s meeting emphasizes aspects of the solid and fluid earth in which the dynamics is regulated by wave propagation and breaking, stress accumulation and fracture. Those include flow and fracture of ice sheets, slips in faults and generation of earthquakes, transport in geophysical turbulent flows and porous media, dynamics of avalanches. This meeting provides a single multi-disciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas and techniques across the disciplinary boundaries in the Earth Sciences. Funds are requested to support travel and lodging costs for 15 students, post-docs, and early career scientists which is approximately one third of the number attending past meetings. This meting is highly interdisciplinary and international in nature and provides an important opportunity for U.S. students and early career scientists from across the earth sciences and applied mathematics to interact with senior scientists in a small informal setting. This year there will also be an increased emphasis on mathematical aspects of the dynamics of fracture, which can have sudden and destructive consequences, as in the breaking of ice sheets (recently recognized of crucial importance for climate studies and sea level rise predictions, given the unexpected observed acceleration of mass loss from the ice sheets) and in the generation of earthquakes."

Employing curriculum and assessment methods developed by SRI, the team is developing and piloting problem-based, inquiry-oriented curriculum modules about the environmental history of the Washington State Puget Sound region and about what implications the history has for the American Indian communities in the region. The Data-driven Inquiry in Geoscience Environmental Restoration Studies (DIGERS) modules are using data collected by the UW team for the Puget Sound Regional Synthesis Model (PRISM) and Puget Sound River History Project. The modules will be pilot-tested in a new undergraduate environmental history course at UW and in science classes in high schools serving American Indian students in Seattle and Puget Sound tribal communities. The curriculum modules will consist of problem-based units and performance assessments centered on student use of the UW data, plus accompanying geographic visualizations and other representations. DIGERS will provide the UW geoscientists with the opportunity to demonstrate to the regional tribes that their research, some of which has been funded by Puget Sound tribes, can be used in the service of the American Indian youths? STEM education in addition to use by tribal agencies in resource restoration and management. DIGERS will provide adaptable and publically available designs of data-centered geoscience inquiry tasks that can support future development of high school and undergraduate-level curricula. In addition, the project will contribute to the knowledge base about how students can become more engaged and more skilled in geoscience inquiry and data analysis and what variations in educational supports and expectations should exist to build successful experiences for the students with the materials."
15886,NSF,HHS,"This award helps support a workshop to discuss the potential contributions of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment (AR5). A possible outcome of this workshop is the identification of key climate targets for model simulations and data synthesis that can help reduce uncertainties in future climate projections. The planned workshop discussions will focus on the evolution of Earth System modeling, climate variability and abrupt changes, and how to develop appropriate methodologies to reduce uncertainties in climate projection.Specifically, the researcher requests funds from the NSF to help provide partial participant support for approximately sixty scientists to attend a workshop in Estes Park, Colorado from September 14-19, 2008.  Participants at the workshop will have expertise in paleoclimatology and related aspects of climate research and will discuss the pros and cons of specific simulations of key past time periods that could be proposed to the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) for inclusion in a proposed suite of simulations to be done by international modeling groups for the IPCC AR5. The participants will include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and students.  In this manner, an open and lively exchange of views on the science and the concept of a paleoclimate modeling will be enabled."
15899,NSF,NSF,"Chemistry (12)  As part of an effort to integrate new technology and methods into the curriculum, the chemistry department is implementing green chemistry/environmental problem-based laboratories. The goal is to enliven instruction for students by adding to the general chemistry course environmental chemistry laboratories that teach a basic understanding of green chemistry, and by following that course with a coordinated progression of green chemistry experiences throughout the curriculum. Graduates that have completed this progression of problem-based learning laboratories are expected to be better prepared to face the difficult challenges of designing greener processes and thus creating and maintaining a cleaner environment in industry as well as in graduate school settings. Intellectual Merit: The revised curriculum begins in the freshman year with an introduction to green and environmental chemistry. Environmental chemistry applications allow students to make connections between general chemistry techniques and the real world. In the upper-level courses, experiments become more sophisticated and use the problem-based approach.  Students are responsible for developing course specific laboratories by using the newly-acquired spectrophotometers, ion chromatograph, and microwave accelerated reaction system to implement synthesis applications from the current literature. A major application of the ion chromatograph is realized in environmental chemistry where students are able to develop research projects involving the institution's watershed trail. Focusing on green chemistry is providing a springboard for the addition of an environmental chemistry concentration, which is currently under development. Broader Impacts: Impacts of the grant include incorporating innovative materials and technology across the curriculum; increasing the excitement of younger scientists (especially women) for science through use of technology; educating students well-trained in green chemistry problem-solving methods and prepared for success in advanced degrees/industry; and graduating an increased number of chemistry majors through the recruitment potential of new technology. The institution currently has 57 chemistry majors of which 60 % are women.  Beyond science and engineering, the project affects the nonscience majors through the green chemistry emphasis in the ACS Chemistry in Context class. The department also is very active in K-12 outreach, reaching 1800 students with 70 events conducted annually. Local high school students interested in environmental chemistry are using the instrumentation at the annual science day, and the equipment is used for high-level Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science high school projects."

15905,NSF,NSF,"This project features academic institutions partnering with local community based organizations to increase the number of students graduating with an associate's or bachelor's degree in the sciences or mathematics. At its heart are faculty at a four-year institution who are collaborating with colleagues at a local community college to facilitate student transitions from the two-year institution into a broad range of majors in the sciences and mathematics at the baccalaureate institution. Project activities include a non-residential summer bridge program and a summer research experience, complemented by monthly academic year meetings and faculty-to-student and student-to-student mentoring. The bridging program is designed to mitigate weak academic preparation and issues related to transitioning to the university setting from impoverished/rural communities. The authentic research work provides peak experiences that carry students through the challenges of meeting academic standards. A learning community with a strong thematic center ( Building a Better Environment ) provides a point of convergence for diverse scientific interests and highlights the value of interdisciplinary research. The assessment process includes formative and summative evaluation strategies, with particular emphasis on measuring changes in student perceptions and attitudes. Dissemination processes include an array of presentations and publications in both public and academic arenas. The project's intellectual merit lies in its strong programmatic activities that provide unique new opportunities in teaching, research and scholarship that benefit students, faculty, and the participating institutions alike. Evaluation of the project centers on developing evidence of the efficacy of the approach as a model for regional application, where more partnerships of 2- and 4-year institutions are arising as a means to offset the economic barriers to higher education. The project's broader impacts are felt through its creation and enhancement of networks and partnerships for research and education, as well as the professional development of participating faculty. The project is also leading to a better-prepared, more flexible and demographically representative workforce, with consequent economic impact in the northwest Ohio region."

15941,NSF,HHS,"The history of mammals in South America, an island continent throughout most of the last 50 million years, includes textbook examples of how a few ancestral species can evolve into ecologically complex faunas. It also illustrates how biological diversity is affected by climate change, and how island faunas respond to invading species that evolved elsewhere. Unfortunately, most of what is known about South American mammal evolution comes from fossil deposits that are far from Amazonia and other high-diversity tropical regions. Due to recent advances in molecular biology, however, the evolutionary history of organisms that do not have a fossil record can now be reconstructed from DNA sequences. The main goal of this project is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of opossums, South American rainforest marsupials, using DNA sequences and other kinds of data. The results will be used test current hypotheses about when and how ancient climate change and biological invasions impacted mammalian evolution in tropical South America. Molecular data from opossums could also provide evidence for previously unsuspected mass extinctions or periods of rapid species formation that might explain present-day patterns of diversity in other organisms. Among other practical applications, understanding the causes of modern biological diversity, especially in tropical landscapes currently threatened by human activity, is important for maximizing the effectiveness of timely conservation efforts."
15963,NSF,NSF,"Abstract of NSF 0808909: University of Vermont, William Geiger (PI), supported by the Analytical and Surface Science Program of the National Science FoundationIntellectual Summary: Electrochemistry is one of the most versatile tools available to the practicing chemist. Two of the most important areas of applications are in analysis and catalysis. The first of these deals with the identification and quantification of molecules and is critically important to a wide range of needs addressing environmental, biological, and medical problems. The proposed work seeks to develop a new family of analytical 'sensors' based on the idea of labeling the analytical target with a 'marker' that can be turned on and off by the equivalent of an electrical switch. The new marker is derived from an easily prepared manganese complex which can be reversibly switched in an electrolyte medium previously developed at the University of Vermont (UVM). The other major area of inquiry is intended to develop lower-energy and greener ways to utilize simple olefins, which are oil-based organic building blocks, in the preparation of desirable organic compounds that will be of general use to synthetic chemists. A highly efficient electrochemical method will be developed and evaluated with the goal of replacing energy-wasting thermal and photochemical methods by an organometallic rhenium complex which is capable of electro-catalyzing the desired reactions. Broader Impact: In terms of the research results, a successful outcome to the proposed work is expected to broaden the impact of organometallic electrochemistry as a problem-solving method among chemists and biochemists. It is also important for chemists to ask how their efforts might contribute to the daunting task of increasing the efficiency of energy usage in this country and in our world. There are only four important general energy sources at our disposal: nuclear, heat, light, and electricity. Our goal has been, and continues to be, the training of electrochemists to develop advances in the last of these four areas. Graduate students trained in electrochemistry at UVM are employed in a variety of academic, industrial, and government research positions. Because it is important to expand these opportunities to underrepresented groups, this project will offer summer training projects to financially disadvantaged high school students through Project Seed (overseen by the American Chemical Society) and initiate a pilot project which offers a summer research opportunity at UVM to underrepresented undergraduate students from a city-based college having a large minority enrollment.  Thanks to their experience in a research group composed of highly-motivated graduate students and postdocs, the high school and visiting undergraduate students will be more aware of their opportunities in pre- and post-graduate higher education, thereby increasing the probability that they will become scientific professionals."
15987,NSF,NSF,"Significant theoretical progress has been made in recent years on the problem of three neutral atoms colliding at ultracold temperatures. Much of that progress has relied on computational physics, and there is now a unique opportunity to substantially advance the computational solution of the ultracold few-body problem. This opportunity comes from an unlikely source: computer video gamers. The computational power that has been built into computer video cards to drive games is enormous, promising orders ofmagnitude improvement over computing on typical workstations. Moreover, recentdevelopments have made it much easier for the high performance computingcommunity to tap into this power, and that is what is proposed here. At the same time, several improvements are proposed to both the underlying representation of the problem and the numerical algorithms employed. Taken together, this three-pronged attack on the problem can be expected to render currently intractable problems in ultracold few-body physics tractable. In turn, these advances in computational physics can be expected to further our theoretical understanding of these problems."
16055,NSF,HHS,"The University of Massachusetts-Amherst is awarded a grant to develop an open-source computational workbench, the Horton project.  This workbench will allow microbial ecologists to statistically describe and compare microbial communities using DNA sequence information within the R programming environment.  Advancing the field of bioinformatics within microbial ecology is essential as the field grapples with concepts such as community structure-function relationships, biogeography, effects of perturbation, and understanding the ecology of polymicrobial infections.  These concepts are particularly challenging in microbial ecology because of the staggering complexity that characterizes most microbial communities.  The first generation of tools that were developed have significantly advanced the field of microbial ecology.  Continued development of these tools and the creation of new tools are essential as investigators pose new research questions and use alternative sources of data including metagenomics and pyrosequencing.  It is also possible that many of these tools will be useful to classical community ecologists employing molecular tools.  This project will pursue three specific aims: (i) initiate the user-supported Horton Project to develop and disseminate a collection of recipes for describing and comparing microbial communities; (ii) improve the versatility and performance of pre-existing methods and develop new methods for describing and comparing collections of PCR-generated sequence collections; (iii) expand and validate additional tools for use with pyrosequencing and metagenomic sequence collections.  The proposed research will facilitate other investigators in their attempts to create new knowledge and improve effective information management within the field of microbial ecology and perhaps beyond.  In addition to the scientific impacts of the project, the broader impacts will include facilitating an 8-week long mentor-training workshop for graduate students, postdocs, and faculty.  Finally, workshops will be offered each summer to train microbial ecologists to use phylogenetic and statistical software."
16063,NSF,HHS,"Technical. This project focuses on the growth and investigates the interface physics of epitaxial graphene (EG)?thin graphitic carbon films with one or a few sheets of sp2-bonded carbon at-oms, grown on silicon carbide substrates. Using surface science methods (including characteriza-tion via low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and related techniques), new growth methods for EG on SiC will be developed, and the physics of several types interfaces will be studied. These interfaces are relevant for nanometer-scale devices, and they encompass funda-mental materials science. For example: EG-SiC interface; the substrate profoundly affects the 2D electron system by doping the graphene, by potentially changing the graphene sublattice symme-try, and by the formation of interface states. Similar considerations hold for successive graphene sheets, resulting in layer-dependent electronic properties. Metal-EG contacts; this contact mates a 3D Fermi surface to a 2D Fermi surface, with unique wave vector matching (or mismatching) across the interface. The work function difference and voltage bias across the interface create a 2D 'puddle' of screening charge under the metal contact. EG pn junctions; transitions from hole-doping to electron-doping occur in gated transport devices. Simple wave-vector matching across such a unique 1D interface brings analogies to 'negative index materials' or particle-antiparticle processes. The effect of electron correlations near such an interface is unknown. pn junction in-terfaces also will be present near the perimeter of high-work-function metal contacts (or islands) that locally hole-dope the EG (which is naturally electron-doped on SiC). Other forms of local-ized doping, such as chemical modification of edges, are also expected to create pn junctions in EG devices. EG-NPEG Schottky barriers; extended EG sheets are semi-metals, whereas nano-patterned EG (NPEG) ribbons exhibit a confinement band gap. The physics of the transition from semi-metal to semiconductor is similar to that of Schottky barrier formation at a metal-semiconductor interface, but the transition region is atomically continuous. The unique 2DES formed by the pi-bands in EG is directly accessible to electron spectroscopies. The approach util-izes surface science microscopies/spectroscopies, Raman spectroscopy, and conventional magnetotransport to probe the basic physics of these interfaces. Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of elec-tronic/photonic materials science and condensed matter physics having technological relevance. Basic understanding gained is expected to lead to improved device performance, and to allow de-sign of new electronic components. The project integrates research and education providing graduate and undergraduate students with laboratory experience and training while conducting forefront research. Recruitment of underrepresented groups into the physical sciences will be ac-tively pursued. The project ties research to education at all levels (K-12, undergraduate, graduate, continuing-ed), through participation in programs designed by education professionals: Middle/High school teachers experience research in the principal investigator's laboratory for 7 weeks/summer through the Georgia Industrial Fellowships for Teachers (GIFT) program."
16065,NSF,NSF,"This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) award will take advantage of the ~10-year peak-flow to occur in April, 2008, in the Mississippi River to gather direct measurements of carbon and sediment flux. In particular, this rare event provides an ideal opportunity to answer the following questions: 1) How is organic carbon of varying sources transported and processed by rivers? and 2) How do flooding rivers accumulate and distribute sediments to adjacent wetlands? A two stage sampling program (ship-based and land-based) will be employed to sample the suspended load, total organic carbon, bulk organic carbon age spectra,nutrients, and hydrology of the river during the peak-flow event. Hydro-acoustic techniques will be used to determine the velocity structure of the river in flood. Short-lived, naturally occurring radioisotopes(e.g. 7Be) will be used in combination with x-radiographs and classical sedimentology methods to quantify recent deposition. Long cores will be collected to ultimately compare these rates to long-term sedimentation histories.In light of the environmental destruction that occurred in the Mississippi River delta region in 2005, coupled with the region's vulnerability to current and future climate changes, this project tackles  issues that are highly relevant to both society, to policy and decision makers, and to a broad spectrum of environmental and engineering scientists."

16131,NSF,HHS,"Title: Formal Methods for Multi-core Shared Memory Protocol DesignPI: Ganesh GopalakrishnanInst: University of UtahNSF Proposal Number: 0811429 ABSTRACT:The human society crucially depends on computing devices: from embedded computers in phones to peta-scale computing systems that can perform a million billion multiplications every second, and help simulate everything from car crashes to hurricanes. The performance of a computer must increase each year, without which the information-based human society will cease to advance. Unfortunately, past methods to increase the performance of a computer ? namely increasing the clock frequency and the functional unit complexity -- cease to be effective. These techniques now produce only a miniscule performance increase, while causing huge increases in the energy consumption. Already computing equipments consume more than 5% of the nation's electricity! The only available energy-efficient method of increasing computer performance is through the use of multiple central processing units (CPUs). Unfortunately, such organizations (called  multi-core CPUs ) require that the accesses to the central memory be extremely efficient - requiring the use of highly complex protocols - called cache coherence protocols.  Unfortunately these protocols must be hand-crafted for high performance, and hence are extremely error-prone. Previous methods to verify cache coherence protocols were already at the limits of the capabilities of verification tools. With the advent of multi-core CPUs, the complexity has become out of reach of all published techniques. The PI and his team are the only academic group to have developed techniques to verify, using mathematically sound computer algorithms, hierarchical multi-core CPU cache coherence protocols.  Unfortunately, their methods to date have involved expert humans and often cause considerable tedium.  The proposed methods in this proposal are expected to: (1) reduce the burden of verifying cache coherence protocols, and (2) help bridge two central abstraction gaps, thus minimizing the chances of errors in microprocessors: (i) high-level to low-level behavioral modeling gap, and (ii) the low behavioral level to hardware implementation level gap.  It will help train valuable manpower - including undergraduates and under-represented groups. It will help sustain the technological momentum of the US, as the availability of sustained high performance computing power is no less important to the nation than its other basic needs such as water, clean air, and energy.  The verification tools developed in this project are expected to be technology transferred to the computer industry.  Last but not least, the students trained in this project will join the national and international high-technology labor force."

16206,NSF,HHS,"The encapsulation of atoms in fullerenes offers a unique natural laboratory to examine the behavior of an atom in confinement. Studies of these endohedral compounds can not only lead to intriguing effects at the atomic scale but also can probe subtleties of quantum effects in the nanometer region. Besides the single-wall confinement, the multi-walled confining shell of nested concentric single-walled fullerenes, bucky-onions,can make the coupling of the central atom with the shell rich in novel effects.Technologically also the endohedral fullerenes hold the promise of exciting applications:(a) Research is underway to use endohedrally doped fullerenes and bucky onions as seed materials in solid state quantum computations, in which quantum bits can be encoded in the electronic and nuclear spins of the encapsulated atoms. (b) Recent experiments with Ar@C60 find evidence of encaged atoms significantly improving the superconducting ability of materials. (c) A proposed biomedical application of endohedral materials is to shield radioactive tracers inside fullerene cages, and then inject the material into human blood to monitor blood flow. (d) The ability of fullerenes to sequester metal atoms inside has led to exploring their potential as contrast-enhancing agents for magnetic resonance imaging. The discovery of endo fullerenes with trapped noble gases in extraterrestrial environments indicates the astrophysical relevance of their studies. Therefore, understanding the influence of the confining cage on thespectroscopy of the atom inside, and vice versa, are matters of significant interest.A theoretical photoionization study of these compounds is proposed. Photoionization is a well known method to obtain a fairly undistorted account of the many-electron dynamics of the discrete and continuum states of atomic systems, since the coupling of the photon with the electrons is so weak and the photon disappears in the final channel.Employing this tool we will investigate the role of the collective motion of delocalized electrons in endohedrally doped single- and multi-walled fullerenes. Cross sections and asymmetry parameters of the ionization from both atomic and fullerene sub-shells will be calculated to understand the many-body interactions that determine the photoabsorption properties of these nanoparticles.Moreover, the diffraction of atomic photo-liberated electrons in crossing the confining wall will be studied in detail in the spirit of a recently discussed Fourier photo-spectroscopy approach."
16224,NSF,NSF,"The PI plans to investigate projects in four areas, related by the theme of nonlinear PDE's and their interaction and applications to complex and symplectic geometry.  In the first project, the PI will work on Donaldson's program of extending Yau's theorem in Kahler geometry to symplectic 4-manifolds.  The ultimate goal is to tackle some fundamental questions in symplectic and almost complex geometry, such as:  given an almost complex 4-manifold, when does there exist a compatible symplectic form?  The second project deals with the constant scalar curvature equation on Kahler manifolds.  It is believed that the existence of a solution to this nonlinear PDE should be equivalent to the algebraic stability of the manifold.  The PI will examine this via the natural energy functionals associated to this problem, building on his work with Phong, Song and Sturm.  The third project concerns the Kahler-Ricci and Calabi flows and aims to elucidate the relationship between the convergence properties of these parabolic flows and conditions of stability and positive curvature.  The final project also involves parabolic PDE's:  the geometric flows of Donaldson which arise naturally from considerations of moment maps and diffeomorphism groups.  The PI will investigate the behavior of these flows, on Kahler and hyperkahler manifolds, and possible applications to the study of canonical metrics and the space of symplectic forms.The fundamental laws of physics are described, in the language of mathematics, by differential equations.  Understanding the behavior of solutions to differential equations (such as Einstein's equations) is key to unravelling the mystery of the geometry and structure of the universe.  This proposal concerns equations which arise naturally in the study of geometry and are related to, and inspired by, the physical laws.  There is a complex interaction between such differential equations, which are described locally, and the underlying geometry, which is global.  This project aims to investigate this rich interplay between local and global and in the process touch on some basic problems in mathematics:  what are the natural structures in geometry, and how do we find and describe them?"
16260,NSF,HHS,"PI BreunerProposal # IOS 0808479Doctoral Dissertation Research: Transition to Independence- Exploring theExtreme Life History of AlbatrossesIn species with parental care, transition to independence is the first true test of individual fitness.  In many birds, leaving the nest (1) ends parental care, (2) requires an abrupt transition from immobility to sustained flight, and (3) requires learning to forage.  In light of these requirements, it is not surprising that age and condition at departure can influence future survival and reproductive success.  What proximate triggers do fledglings use to time this important life-history transition?  Past studies have focused either on morphological, energetic, or endocrine correlates of fledging. This proposal addresses proximate triggers of fledging, integrating measures of morphology, energetic reserves, and endocrine physiology in a long-lived seabird, the Laysan Albatross.  Further, hormone levels and food availability will be manipulated to experimentally address interactions between energetics, body mass, food delivery, and glucocorticoid hormones.  The combination of strategies will allow for experimental evaluation of fledging behavior within a physiological framework.  Broader impacts include strong conservation biology implications. Laysan Albatross have been identified as one of a number of indicator species for the seabird colonies of the NWHI and are a major consumer of marine resources, so their reproductive success is reflective of the health and status of the oceans.  Knowledge of the mechanisms and effects of physiological changes during fledging will aid in both understanding the mechanisms of behavior and the informed management of long-lived oceanic seabirds."
16277,NSF,NSF,"ABSTRACTPrincipal Investigator: Braun, Benjamin J.Proposal Number: DMS - 0758321Institution: University of Kentucky Research FoundationTitle: Topological and Algebraic CombinatoricsThe PI investigates problems in topological and algebraic combinatorics.  The theory of Ehrhart polynomials is of broad interest to the mathematics community due to connections with commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, discrete and convex geometry, and number theory.  The PI studies roots and coefficients of Ehrhart polynomials, with particular focus on reflexive polytopes.  The PI also investigates problems regarding graph and poset homomorphism complexes, continuing the application of algebraic topology to combinatorics.  The PI studies possible homotopy test graphs and investigates connections between poset homomorphism complexes and poset order dimension.  Finally, in joint work with Richard Ehrenborg, the PI studies simplicial subcomplexes of the boundary complexes of associahedra arising from triangulations of non-convex polygons.Mathematics has historically been driven by the interplay between discrete and continuous structures.  Contemporary problems arising from the interaction of combinatorics, algebra, and topology continue this tradition.  The study of polytopes began in antiquity, with roots in the solid geometry of Euclid.  Ehrhart theory is a contemporary approach to studying polytopes from a combinatorial and algbraic perspective, producing from a polytope with integer vertices a polynomial counting lattice points in integral dilates of that polytope.  The roots and coefficients of these polynomials are known to carry some combinatorial and geometric data, but there are many open questions about exactly how far this line of investigation can be taken.  The study of graphs began in the 1700's with investigations by Euler, and has found modern day applications in most areas of science and engineering.  Studying chromatic numbers of graphs by moving to the continuous world leads to investigations of topological spaces with symmetries arising from symmetries of the graphs under consideration.  Investigations in this direction have been successful so far, and many open questions remain."
16319,NSF,HHS,"My main goal in this project is to carry out computations in motivic homotopy theory, i.e., the homotopy theory of algebraic varieties.Voevodsky's now famous proof of the Milnor Conjecture is based primarily on techniques in motivic homotopy theory.  Specifically, I am interested in the motivic version of the Adams spectral sequence, with base field R or C.  One reason to focus only on R or C is that thorough computations are possible over these fields, but the computations still exhibit non-classical phenomena.  The motivic Adams spectral sequence has a major deficiency in that it is not known to converge.  Even if the spectral sequence does not converge, it is nonetheless possible to draw many conclusions about motivic stable homotopy groups.  I believe that these and other further computations will be an important guide to further study of motivic homotopy theory.  There is also a chance that motivic computations will reveal something new about classical stable homotopy groups.Homotopy theory is a technique for studying geometric objects up to certain kinds of deformations.  Homotopical approaches often allow for concrete calculations that are otherwise inaccessible.  Computations of stable homotopy groups have been a major topic of research in topology since the middle of the 20th century.  Although tremendous progress has been made, much remains unknown.  In the 1990's, Fabien Morel and Vladimir Voevodsky developed motivic homotopy theory.  In analogy to classical homotopy theory, motivic homotopy theory allows us to study algebraic objects up to certain kinds of deformations.  My goal is to carry out some fundamental computations in motivic homotopy theory.  The goal is both a better understanding of the new algebraic theory as well as the classical geometric theory."

16424,NSF,NSF,"AbstractAward:  DMS-0805085Principal Investigator:  Peter AlbersThis project aims to investigate three sets of problems.  First,the principal investigator's PhD thesis laid the foundations of anovel approach to functoriality for Floer homology, and the nextsteps in this direction are to remove some restrictive hypothesesand to confirm the compatibility of this theory with thepair-of-pants product on Floer homology.  Second, Frauenfelderand the PI have recent established Floer homology for negativeline bundles, that is, for a class of non-compactly supportedHamiltonian functions in non-compact symplectic manifolds, andthis theory should be made more robust by removing symplecticasphericity hypotheses and should also be extended to aMorse-Bott situation.  Third, the PI will apply the Fredholmtheory in polyfolds developed by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder toexplore newly emerging invariants from the theory of polyfoldswith operations.Symplectic geometry is the study of spaces equipped with thebasic structure that underlies Hamiltonian mechanics, for whichpreferred coordinates give both position and momentum of a movingobject and in which conservation of energy is natural andinevitable.  The Floer homology theory referred to in the firstparagraph studies such manifolds through the critical pointbehaviors of certain auxiliary spaces; this kind of analysis ofcritical points goes back to work of Marston Morse circa the1930s, but its application in the modern context requires newtools such as the polyfold theory cited above."
16426,NSF,NSF,"CBET-0754158FuIt is widely known that circulating tumor cells arrest in the microvasculature, but this arrest is not random. For example, breast cancer cells preferentially arrest in the small blood vessels of lung, liver, and bone. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this preferential arrest of breast cancer cells in distant organs are not well understood. Although both biochemical and mechanical factors are found to play a role in tumor cell arrest and adhesion in the microvasculature, the quantitative understanding of their contribution is poor. The long-term goal of our research is to elucidate the relationships between microcirculation-induced mechanical factors, microvascular permeability (vascular integrity), cell adhesion molecules, and tumor metastasis in intact microvessels. The objective of this project is to investigate the relationships between localized hydrodynamic factors in curved/stretched microvessels, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-induced microvascular hyperpermeability, and tumor cell arrest and adhesion in intact microvessels. On the basis of the preliminary studies, a newly developed in vivo single vessel perfusion/bending method, which can create non-uniformly distributed shear rates/stresses along the vessel wall, will be used to test two hypotheses: 1) Tumor cells prefer to arrest at the locations of the higher shear rates and shear rate gradients in the microvasculature. The higher shear rates/shear rate gradients activate the endothelial cells and the tumor cells to increase the binding of tumor cells to the vessel wall and to increase the accumulation of tumor cells; 2) Tumor cells prefer to arrest in the microvessel with increased permeability. The increased tumor cell adhesion to the microvessel wall with increased permeability is partially due to the radial pressure gradient that drives the cells towards the wall.A series of in vivo experiments will be performed on individually perfused microvessels in rat mesentery. Quantitative fluorescence video and confocal microscopy will be used to measure the adhesion rates of fluorescently dyed tumor cells in straight and curved/stretched microvessels under various flow and permeability conditions. Numerical simulation will be employed to quantify the profiles of shear rates and stresses, pressures, velocities and vorticities in the microvessel for each experimental condition. Specific aims are: 1) to measure the adhesion rates of normal, non-malignant (MCF-10A), and malignant (MDA-MB-435) breast epithelial cells in the straight microvessels under known bulk flow rates and a) under conditions of normal and increased permeability by VEGF; b) after pretreatment with the blocking antibodies to endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and c) after pretreatment with the blocking antibodies to tumor cell adhesion molecules; 2) to measure the adhesion rates of normal, MCF-10A, and MDA-MB-435 breast epithelial cells in the curved/stretched microvessels under known bulk flow rates and under the same conditions as in Aim 1; 3) to quantify the shear rate, shear stress, normal stress (pressure), velocity and vorticity profiles by numerical simulation in the straight and curved/stretched microvessels under known bulk flow rates and under conditions of normal and increased permeability by VEGF for two cases: a) when there are no tumor cells in the microvessel, and b) when there are tumor cells attached to the wall. This project provides a direct tool in the quantitative assessment of the role of hydrodynamic factors and adhesion molecules of tumor and endothelial cells in tumor metastasis under normal and inflammatory conditions, and hence helps define a new class of targets for therapeutic drug design for cancer. It is hoped that inhibitory reagents that prevent cancer cell arrest and adhesion in the microcirculation and reagents that enhance the microvessel wall integrity may be used in combination with traditional therapies to combat this malignant disease more effectively. Meanwhile, this project will provide an opportunity to train both graduate and undergraduate students in a new promising field, engineering approach to cancer therapy, as well as to broaden and diversify the research areas of the City College of New York, a minority serving institution."

Instable homotopy theory, the objective is to begin makingfundamental computations in the theory of topological automorphicforms developed in joint work with Behrens.  This will firstproceed by examining and computing the homotopy of spectraassociated to certain moduli of abelian surfaces such as Shimuracurves, and then by working towards higher chromatic filtrations.In algebraic K-theory, the objective is to make systematic use ofthe relationship between formal group laws and complex cobordismto systematize computations in algebraic K-theory and relate themto the chromatic filtration, with the hope of gainingunderstanding of the  chromatic redshift  phenomenon.The subject of homotopy theory arose as a method to answerconcrete questions in geometry by way of algebra.  In theprocess, a strange connection was discovered with formal grouplaws, which themselves are intimately related to quite differentsubjects such as number theory and elliptic curves.  Inparticular, there is a surprising connection between ellipticcurves and mathematical physics.

This conference will be held in Atlanta, USA from April 24th to April 26th, 2008 (http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm08/).Jointly organized by computer scientists and statisticians, this technical conference is a premiere venue for presenting new research results in the area of data mining, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Selection of award recipients will be done on the basis of quality of their research progress, as well as the potential to benefit from attending this meeting. Special emphasis will be given to graduate students, and in particular women and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds.Attending conferences such as SDM is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field.Such experiences help students in a number of ways ways. First, it enables them to get exposure to a wide range of cutting edge ideas in their field, beyond what they are likely to be exposed to in their home institutions and research groups. Second, it provides them an opportunity to meet established researchers, which can potentially lead to long term interactions and mentoring relationships. Third, in case they are presenting a paper, it provides an opportunity for early feedback on their thesis research and presentation skills from a broad audience. All of these benefits are invaluable in ensuring the development of research excellence, leading to a productive career in innovative research.

16501,NSF,NSF,"ABSTRACT Principal Investigator: Smith, Karen E.Proposal Number: DMS - 0810844 Institution: University of Michigan Ann Arbor Title: Commutative Algebra and its InteractionsThis proposal is for a conference that will take place at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, July 31--August 5, 2008. The conference will focus on recent advances in commutative algebra, centered around areas which have been greatly influenced by the contributions of Mel Hochster. These include tight closure, singularities and multiplier ideals, the homological conjectures, invariant theory, local cohomology, the structure of free resolutions, and combinatorial commutative algebra. Hochster's research has had a transforming impact on the field, and there are several highly active areas which rely on his past and present work. We hope to bring together these areas for fruitful interaction. Commutative algebra is the study of equations: to paraphrase Hochster,  ...algebra, after all, has to do with solving equations. Abstract algebra is the daughter of the theory of equations (in the broadest sense) and perhaps its best theorems still deal with that subject.  Striking developments in the last few decades in commutative algebra have reinforced this view of commutative algebra. These developments include solutions to classical problems, as well as strengthened connections with diverse areas including algebraic topology, group cohomology, algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, invariant theory, and algebraic and arithmetic geometry. The invited speakers include experts in different areas, as well as several young researchers. The conference will provide an opportunity to present key results and recent advances. A special effort will be made to support the expenses of young researchers, women and minorities, graduate students, and those without alternative means of support."

16540,NSF,HHS,"The proposed research aims to developing a general formulation and the related methods for sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) where a specific functional (or parameter) of the conditional distribution is of interest. The past two decades have seen vigorous development of the SDR methods and have accrued a striking record of their successful applications. However, to a large extent these methods treat the conditional distribution as the object of interest, without discriminating between parameter of interest and nuisance parameter. While there are methods that target statistical functionals, they are specific to the parameter in consideration and as such  are difficult to apply to other parameters. The investigators propose a new paradigm for SDR that focuses on a functional of the conditional distribution, which can be any one in a very wide class that covers most of applications. In addition, the investigators propose to develop a coherent collection of associated techniques for estimation, computation, and asymptotic inference.High throughput technologies that produce massive amount of complex and high-dimensional data are increasingly prevalent in such diverse areas as  business, government administration, environmental studies, machine learning, and bioinformatics. These provide considerable momentum in the Statistics community to develop new theories and methodologies, and to reformulate the existing ones, that are capable of discovering critical evidence from high-dimensional and massive data. SDR is a recent area of statistical research that arose amidst, and has been propelled by, these new demands. The investigators propose to reformulate the theories and methodologies of SDR so that they can be specifically tailored to target to be estimated. This new paradigm not only synthesizes, broadens, and deepens the recent advances in SDR, but brings the understanding of SDR on a par with classical statistical inference theory, by following the tradition of sufficiency, efficiency, information, parameter of interests, and nuisance parameters, which are the key ideas that has helped to propel classical inference to its maturity."
16589,NSF,NSF,"TECHNICAL: Changes in the local composition of metals and alloys are key to many fundamental aspects of materials science and engineering (MS&E). These variations may be large in compositional difference, but they are usually small in spatial extent, often occurring over a nanometer or less. When composition fluctuations are associated with defects in polycrystalline materials, they may induce deleterious property changes, such as the catastrophic brittle failure of metals and alloys via, for example, hydrogen-, temper-, or irradiation-enhanced embrittlement. Until recently, it has not been possible to measure these composition changes directly and relate them to the mechanical behavior, the crystallography, the electronic structure, and the defect structure of the material. However, such measurements are now possible. In a previous NSF grant, the PI has developed methods for mechanical testing of small volumes of material, including samples that can contain a single grain boundary. In two prior NSF grants, the co-PI has participated in the acquisition of two aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) and has developed computer-processing methods to detect and quantify sub-nanometer scale composition changes at large numbers of grain boundaries (GBs) and precipitates. Initial data have been obtained in model systems and commercial alloys. The objective of this project is to explore and accurately quantify nanoscale composition changes associated with GB segregation in metals and alloys, and to establish the connections between GB character and mechanical behavior through direct testing and through modeling. The assembled team of international collaborators has combined skills that will enhance understanding of the complex interplay between GB crystallography and local chemistry via a unique combination of the most advanced electron microscopy/spectroscopy and 3D atom-probe methods with the latest first-principles simulations and in-situ mechanical testing techniques. The research will generate hitherto-unobtainable composition and mechanical behavior data associated with grain-boundary segregation, selecting specific interfaces from hundreds or even thousands that can now be analyzed for the first time. NON-TECHNICAL: The broader impact of this research will arise through the potential to revise the basic understanding of the role of composition variations on segregation and mechanical properties, which are central to the education and training of all MS&E students. These latest advances in materials characterization will enhance the research and education infrastructure and will be taught to many classes of Lehigh students and hundreds of industrial attendees at Lehigh?s Annual Microscopy School, now in its 38th year. The results will be disseminated to the materials community through technical presentations, publications and a new textbook. Improvements in the measurement of nanoscale elemental changes in metals and alloys have the potential to modify basic theories of segregation, and will lay the groundwork for similar studies of precipitation in the future. In turn, this knowledge may permit the re-design of standard fabrication and processing methods that control the properties of materials. Thus the long-term result may affect society in the broadest sense through improved metals and alloys for the physical infrastructure, the hydrogen economy, aerospace and automobiles."

16635,NSF,HHS,"Plant adaptation to soil physical and chemical environments, or edaphic factors, is known to influence plant distribution, diversification, and speciation. However, the mechanisms of plant adaptation to edaphic factors are not fully understood. Traditionally, the study of edaphic adaptation has focused on the direct effects of soil conditions on plant growth and reproduction. A new theoretical and experimental framework will be explored, in which plant adaptation to edaphic factors is mediated through arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The goals of this research are to determine if adapted plant ecotypes require specific AM fungal taxa, if serpentine soils shape AM fungal assemblages, and if AM fungi impact plant growth and fitness in serpentine soil. Findings thus far show that the plant ecotypes associate with distinct AM fungal assemblages in the field. This project uses serpentine, a naturally toxic soil, to test the role of common root symbionts, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, in plant adaptation to extremely stressful soil environments. Broader impacts include contributions to taxonomy and education, and potential applications to conservation and bioremediation. Previously unknown fungal species are likely to be found associated with plants on serpentine soils. Undergraduate students and a PhD student will be trained in an important area of microbial biology. Collection and identification of fungi that are key components of a fragile, botanically important ecosystem could dramatically improve success of restoration efforts of locally endangered or rare species. Fungal species with unique physiological capabilities may be useful for bioremediation of toxic sites."
16678,NSF,HHS,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project seeks to develop technology to help teachers and schools evaluate speech fluency in young children and to provide an innovative and unique method of intervention when speech problems are discovered. An initial goal of this research project is to develop automatic speech recognition software that is designed to identify specific aspects of speech that are related to early childhood education, such as rhyming, blending, vowel sounds. Current technologies specifically designed for adult speech recognition will be customized to identify aspects of a child's speech related to phonemic awareness. Thesecond major goal of the research is to develop an novel procedure for the instruction and intervention of children with speech fluency difficulties, specifically, to 'mirror' the child's voice back to the child with the hope that the child will be able to self-correct the speech impediment.A child's speech is foundational to his or her literacy development and assessing speech fluency for the purpose of individualizing curriculum is a vital role of early childhood education. As schools nationwide are confronted with increased accountability due to 'No Child Left Behind' and 'Reading First' legislation, the technology proposed by this research plan could become an indispensable tool for use elementary schools. Currently, such speech fluency evaluations are typically delivered individually by teachers and consume a great deal of time and money. The proposed research will offer teachers an independently administered assessment and instructional technology that would be easy to use and provide immediately available and actionable information for schools."
16690,NSF,HHS,"The aim of this project is to further the understanding of how vertex algebras are related to geometry of manifolds. While vertex algebras, a relatively new concept in algebra, have always been understood as an essential part of conformal field theory, their relation to higher dimensional geometry, even though implicit in string theory, had been rather obscure for a while. In 1998 Malikov, Schechtman and Vaintrob proposed the notion of chiral differential operators as a direct such link. Later work has found several applications of this new theory and, rather recently,  Witten and Kapustin identified algebras of chiral differential operators with the so-called Witten half-twisted model in string theory.One characteristic feature of this proposal is that it truly belongs to the interface of several disparate disciplines, such as algebra, geometry, and theoretical physics. Indeed, vertex algebras are purely algebraic objects, which only relatively recently were found to be closely related to geometry of manifolds. On the other hand, this area of research is essentially a mathematical counterpart of the physics of strings. The results of the proposal are therefore expected to have a broad impact on research community."
16696,NSF,NSF,"Professor Jonathan Rosenberg will study problems in classical and noncommutative topology, as well as various applications, especially to differential geometry and mathematical physics. One main focus of the proposal will be the application of noncommutative geometry to mathematical physics, especially string theory. Noncommutative sigma-models will be analyzed and compared with their classical counterparts. This will require development of some aspects of a new theory of noncommutative nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations.  Other topics will include the classification of metrics of positive scalar curvature on manifolds, the purely algebraic K-theory of operator algebras, and the use of invariants coming from C*-algebras (especially Kasparov?s KK-theory) to study the geometry and topology of manifolds. For example, the K-homology classes coming from the classical elliptic operators, such as the signature operator and the Dolbeault operator, will be computed, and their invariance and rigidity properties will be determined. As a result, we expect to understand better the links between topological and analytic approaches to geometry of manifolds and singular spaces.Many physical theories, such as general relativity, are formulated in terms of geometry and partial differential equations.  However, the principles of quantum mechanics require studying space-time ``geometries''in which the coordinate functions do not commute with one another. One main focus of this project will be the reformulation of some of the partial differential equations of mathematical physics in the setting of such noncommutative geometries.  We will develop tools for studying these noncommutative equations and will compare the noncommutative geometries with their classical counterparts. This should advance the language for formulating quantum theories of gravity.Professor Rosenberg will also train graduate students and advanced undergraduate students in algebra, analysis, geometry, topology, and mathematical physics, and will also work toward integration of mathematical software into the undergraduate mathematics curriculum."

One principal conclusion of the APS Multidivisional Study stated: ?We recommend, as a high priority, a phased program of sensitive searches for neutrinoless nuclear double-beta decay.? NLDB decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are their own antiparticles and it is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, an important symmetry in elementary-particle physics. In addition, if neutrinos are Majorana particles, an accurate measurement of the NLDB-decay half-life might well be possible; it would yield the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino which, when combined with the results of neutrino oscillation experiments, would determine all three neutrino-mass eigenvalues. This award will provide funds to support the USC group to continue their involvement in the Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE), an array of 988 TeO2 bolometers, at Gran Sasso (LNGS), Italy. CUORE is the successor to CUORICINO, currently the most sensitive NLDB decay experiment in operation. The USC team is responsible for the procurement and production of the complete CUORE electronic system starting at the detector and ending at the input of data acquisition system. The PI is the U.S. Task Coordinator for the construction of CUORE-0, the first of the 19 towers of CUORE. It will serve as a test of the specific construction procedures of CUORE, and will operate in the CUORICINO cryostat. This will yield physics results beyond those of CUORICINO.

16700,NSF,HHS,"CBET- 0834973Chu, Kung-HuiTexas Engineering Experiment StationHexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) is a cyclic nitramine explosive, which has been widely used in military and civilian applications since World War II. The widespread use of RDX caused soil/groundwater contamination in the United States and other countries. Since RDX is toxic and a possible human carcinogen, remediation of RDX-contaminated sites is one of the major environmental engineering problems. Although anoxic/anaerobic biodegradation of RDX were observed, field application of RDX bioremediation remains a great challenge because of limited understanding of the microbial ecology of RDX-degraders, particular the interrelationships among active degraders, non-degraders, and their associated microbial community under different environmental conditions. In this research, carbon flow from 13C-labeled RDX to genetic makeup of active RDX-degraders will be traced by applying the methods of real-time-t-RFLP and Q-FAST, which were developed earlier by the PI. The principal objective of this research is to identify the diversity of RDX-utilizing bacteria under different environmental conditions. The research hypothesis is that RDX-utilizers, particularly those using RDX as a sole carbon source, are present in both clean and explosive-contaminated environments. This project will lead to the development of a range of key biomarkers relating to degradative activities of RDX to support remediation design and monitoring. Also, results of this project will make a significant scientific contribution to the fields of microbial ecology, applied microbiology, and environmental science and engineering. The knowledge derived by this research would guide the isolation efforts for new microorganisms that can be used for further physiological and biochemical studies as well as for bioaugmentation."

TASI has been highly successful in achieving this by providing a series of lectures and seminars on topics of current research in theoretical particle physics and related experimental subjects. Each summer TASI focuses on or two broad topics in theoretical particle physics, the topics chosen (by the Scientific Advisory Committee including the general director) being timely and relevant both from experimental and theoretical point of view. One or two Physicists who are experts on these topics are invited to direct the program in concert with the director who is the PI. TASI-2008 will be held during June 2 - 27, 2008, and the topic is  Phenomenology of LHC Physics  and the outside program directors are Professor Tao Han of University of Wisconsin who is well known for his research in collider physics and Professor Robin Erbacher of UC Davis who is involved in CMS. It will cover various models beyond the Standard Model -- Supersymmetry, little Higgs model(s), physics of extra dimensions and string phenomenology -- and their experimental implications at LHC; there will be several mini courses of four/five lectures in each sub-field. Also, there will be several seminars. At TASI there is close interaction between the lecturers and the students, and student among themselves. This is further enhanced by more than half of lecturers staying in student housing and having meals with students; also, student organized seminars on their works leads to collaborative interaction among students.  The broader impacts of this proposal is that TASI is serving the very useful purpose of training next generations of theoretical high energy physicists to keep U.S.A. in the forefront of this research field in the world. As these trained personnel have a very versatile background in physics and mathematics, they have contributed and will continue to contribute in the task of keeping the country abreast in physical sciences and related fields. TASI has started having videos of lectures available to the worldwide audience, and this will certainly be useful to the high energy physics community at large."

16831,NSF,NSF,"This proposal presents a two-year plan to continue the CTEQ Schools on QCD Analysisand Phenomenology, and requests a renewal of support for a part of the participants' costs of these schools. The physics of elementary particles probes the deepest structure of matter. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) governs the strong interactions of elementary particles, and its study at high energies is increasingly shared by both elementary particle and nuclear physics. Since1992, fourteen CTEQ Summer Schools have played an important role in the world-wide elementary particle and nuclear physics enterprises, by promoting the knowledge of QCD and its applications to electroweak precision measurements and new physics searches. The Schools consist of eight days oflectures and discussion, in which students interact closely with distinguished experts, both theorists and experimentalists. The audience for these schools is primarily the younger generation of high energy elementary particle and nuclear physicists, especially experimentalists. The CTEQ Schools aid intellectual advances by deepening the background of young scientists who contribute to our experimental and theoretical programs. The broader impact of the school is felt through the students' strengthened awareness of the context of their research in the overall undertaking of fundamental physics. The interactive nature of the schools encourages the skills necessary for communicating the excitement and results of fundamental physics within collaborations and to the wider public."
16836,NSF,HHS,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY:Controlling the organization of metallic nanoparticles in three-dimensional space is an important goal for the development of nanometer-scale materials for applications including energy storage, light harvesting, catalysis, and memory storage. One potential route to this goal involves the exploitation of the tendency for block copolymers to undergo micro-phase separation in which each polymer block occupies well-defined spatial regions in the bulk material. Development of such hybrid materials requires an understanding of the synthesis and behavior of specific functional block copolymers.  Ongoing efforts to control ordering and structure of cobalt nanoparticles through controlled synthesis of alkyne-functional polymers will be continued through this grant. The fundamental questions to be addressed by this research relate to understanding how control over structure of alkyne-functional block copolymers can provide control over size and shape of cobalt (and other) nanoparticles. Understanding these relationships will guide subsequent efforts to prepare polymer-inorganic hybrids containing multiple types of nanoparticles.These issues will be approached through the construction of libraries of selected alkyne-functional block copolymers followed by an examination of their phase behavior as a function of polymer size, composition, and cobalt loading.  The effects of these variables on the magnetic properties of the resulting materials and on the nature of the polymer-cobalt interface will subsequently be examined. The physical crosslinks that the alkyne-functional polymers in these systems form under mild conditions will be exploited to control the degree of nanoparticle surface functionalization. This research will further the understanding of how metallic nanoparticles can be incorporated into larger assemblies with the aid of multi-block copolymers and will facilitate future application of these materials. NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:This project aims to increase the understanding of how specifically-designed organic polymer molecules can be used to control how nanometer-sized metal particles come together to form larger materials that show useful magnetic, electronic, and optical properties.  Such designed materials have great potential in a range of applications including solar cells, batteries, catalysts, and memory storage devices.  Researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels will be involved in this research and will participate in the communication of their research to the general public at scientific meetings at the local, regional, and national levels, including the New England Polymer Chemistry Workshop, an informal series of regional meetings designed to give graduate students the opportunity to present their research. The PI will also work through the Summer Enrichment at Dartmouth (SEAD) program to inform students from under-resourced urban and rural high schools about opportunities in scientific research at the college and graduate levels."
16875,NSF,NSF,"The most recent mass extinction event that marks the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/P) boundary occurred at 65 million years ago, resulted in the extinction of 90% of marine plankton and the dinosaurs.  This extinction has been linked to the impact of a large asteroid (the Alvarez hypothesis) that has been traced to the Yucatan peninsula (Chicxulub, Mexico).  However, recent studies in Texas and New Jersey have questioned the paradigm that the Chicxulub impact was the killer at the end of the Cretaceous.  The Chicxulub impact spherules are reported below the boundary at Brazos, TX and an Ir anomaly occurs at the base of a layer of remarkable preservation of Cretaceous ammonites and mollusk fossils in New Jersey outcrops (the Pinna bed). In contrast, previous studies of Continental Dynamics/Ocean Drilling Program Leg 174AX onshore New Jersey coreholes and DSDP/ODP deep-sea coreholes suggest that there is one spherule layer associated with the extinction of the marine plankton overlain by a clay clast layer interpreted as a tsunamite.  Outcrop and subsurface drilling has shown that the New Jersey coastal plain is an excellent location to recover complete and well-preserved K/P boundary sections. PIs will drill three closely spaced drilling transects of shallow (50-70 ft) holes on top of outcrops in New Jersey (Manasquan River, Fort Monmouth, and Crosswicks Creek) that will provide well-preserved material that is superior to outcrop sections for paleontological and geochemical analyses.  They will also analyze in detail the Antioch Church, AL and Brazos, TX coreholes.  Their working hypotheses are that there was one impact associated with one Ir anomaly and one spherule layer that was directly linked to the mass extinction event and that the extinction event was not causally related to major climatic or sea-level changes on the 100 kyr to million-year scale.  Their hypotheses predict finding only one in situ spherule layer and one Ir anomaly in the sections to be intensely sampled."
16877,NSF,NSF,"The proposer aims to study homotopy theoretical properties of various moduli spaces.  These are moduli spaces of manifolds with a geometric structure, for example a complex structure.  The case of complex dimension one gives the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, which by now is relatively well understood.  In contrast, much less is understood about moduli spaces of higher dimensional complex manifolds.  This is project will investigate what can be said about this and related spaces using methods of homotopy theory.  Another goal of this project is to study moduli spaces of manifolds with singularities.  Here, the most basic case is the Deligne-Mumford compactification of Riemann's moduli space.  For many application this space is more important than the uncompactified moduli space, and a homotopy theoretic understanding should be fruitful.  In particular, the proposer will study applications to Gromov-Witten theory.A manifold is a general notion of space.  Manifolds are fundamental in geometry, topology, analysis, and other areas of mathematics.  In physics, they are the underlying geometric structure in Einstein's general theory of relativity, and play fundamental roles in mechanics, quantum field theory, and probably many other areas.  Studying manifolds from a mathematical perspective can be done in two ways: You can study the geometric properties each manifold, one at a time, or you can study geometric properties of the collection of all manifolds at once.  The  collection of all manifolds  can itself be thought of as a kind of space, and each individual manifold is a point in this space.  This space is an example of a moduli space, and the current project aims at understanding geometric and topological properties of this moduli space and its variations."

16986,NSF,HHS,"Proposed research is motivated from the discrimination problem with high dimension, low sample size data. The investigator studies the intrinsic difficulties of the discrimination problem by exploring asymptotic geometric structure of such data. Three main activities are proposed: a) the asymptotic inconsistency of leave-one-out cross-validation. The study is expected to explain why it shall fail when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of observations; b) the effect of the relationship between the dimensionality and the sample size on the difficulty of discrimination task; and c) a discriminant direction vector that only exists for the data with high dimension, low sample size.  The data points collapse on this direction vector and also are most separated by group labels. The investigator plans to study its theoretical and empirical properties of the procedure such as its optimality, uniqueness, and asymptotic performances.The overall goal is to investigate the nontraditional and unique challenges in high dimension, low sample size discrimination. The proposed approach may be regarded atypical, but it is more relevant to the problem itself. The applications of proposed research include text document classification such as Spam email filter, medical imaging such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, and bioinformatics such as microarray gene expression and proteomics."

Mittelstaedt to work with Dr. Anne Davaille at Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) in France.Segmentation of the global mid-ocean ridge system is continually changing with old segments dying and new segments being created.  The largest ridge discontinuities are manifest to 1st order as transform faults and to 2nd order as either overlapping spreading centers (OSCs) or non-transform offsets with little or no overlap (NTOs).  Observations along the East Pacific Rise, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Galapagos Spreading Center indicate that ridge axis segmentation patterns vary with spreading rate and proximity to a hotspot.  Fast-spreading and magmatically-robust ridges generally display rapid segment migration and numerous OSCs.  In contrast, slow-spreading and magmatically-poor ridges typically have long lived ridge segmentation with very slow migration rates and favor NTOs and small transform faults to OSCs.  This research focuses primarily on understanding the processes which control these differing styles of ridge segmentation.  Previous separate numerical, laboratory, and theoretical studies have attempted to understand the formation of ridge segmentation as a function of lithospheric deformation or mantle flow patterns.  However, an overall theory of ridge segmentation is lacking.  We use a joint laboratory and 3-D numerical approach to study the mechanics of ridge segmentation.  The laboratory experiments involve imposing extension on a fluid mixture with brittle-ductile behavior, heated from below and cooled on the surface. The numerical models use the finite-element code Citcom with our recent implementation of pseudo-plastic rheology and simplified melting and melt transport.  The results of these experiments and simulations will be compared to existing geophysical and geochemical data to provide a better understanding of the creation and evolution of ridge segmentation."

17012,NSF,NSF,"The growing power and flexibility of information technology has allowed developers to build increasingly creative tools; however that same capacity has often led to tools whose use is beyond any but the most expert power-user.   One area of creative endeavor of great cultural and economic importance is music. In recent decades, a vast variety of audio production tools have been introduced to enhance and facilitate music creation. Unfortunately, since the tools come from software developers more familiar with Java than musical creativity, many of these tools are extremely complex and use concepts and controllers very different from those that musicians are accustomed to and comfortable with. Since the tools are complex, and interfaces to software suites change every few years, musicians may fail to embrace them or only ?half- learn? them, inhibiting creativity and limiting the range of possible works produced, and the ultimate capacity that powerful technology has to enhance musical creation. Many musicians think about sound in individualistic terms that may not have known mappings onto the controls of existing audio production tools. For example, a violinist may want to make the recording of her violin sound shimmery. While she has a clear concept of what a shimmery sound is, she may not know how to articulate it in terms that let a producer map shimmery onto the available audio tools (such as reverberation and equalization). This project develops a computational tool that works alongside the musician to quickly learn how acoustic features map onto an audio concept, and creates a simple controller to manipulate audio in terms of that concept. In the case of the violin player, the tool would learn what shimmery means to her, and then create a knob that would let her make a sound more or less shimmery. This project uses a user-centered design approach to the development of audio production tools that automatically adapts to the user?s work style, rather than forcing the user to adapt to the tools. The result will be and example of how audio tools can enhance creativity, and more broadly, how affective concepts can be automatically mapped to more discrete parameters associated with digital media production."
17038,NSF,HHS,"SES-0802645David GruskyFrank SamsonStanford UniversityDo whites' views about the importance of traditional meritocratic criteria become malleable when they are confronted with circumstances in which Asians appear to be surpassing whites under the current rules of the game?  The relative success of Asians compared to whites in the United States on various socioeconomic status indicators (college degrees, median earnings, and professional-managerial occupational concentration) as well as the over-representation of Asians at elite higher educational institutions present an emerging social context in which to study commitment to the idea of meritocracy, as indicated by university admissions criteria.  Using a survey-based experiment of a random sample of 1000 California adults, lab-based experiments of college students in various university settings, and in-depth interviews, this project tests sociological and political psychology-based theories about the relationship between race, public opinion, and public policy: here, public university admissions criteria.  In a hyper-competitive undergraduate admissions context where standardized test prep courses and college application private tutors have become both big money and globalized businesses, and intense college preparatory instruction and planning can commence as early as pre-Kindergarten, this study sheds light on the ideational components (e.g. individualism and group attitudes) that constitute support for current academic university admissions criteria.  If support for current admissions criteria, as indicators of meritocracy, have a basis in not only value commitments to individualism and fairness (e.g. rewards for hard work) but also serve as gate-keeping mechanisms amidst racialized groups vying in high-stakes competition for the scarce and valued resource of higher education, traditionally underrepresented groups should be compelled to participate in discussions that re-conceive of university admissions criteria that can reward hard work yet not be used to reproduce group disadvantages and inequalities.  The results of this research can provide a more certain footing for discussion and further research around group-based attitudes and inequalities, political values, and higher education policy."

To what extent is there evidence of growing cross-border articulation of a global system of cities?  Just what is the nature of this relationship between  world cities  and the national states in which they are geographically situated?  To what extent does the world city system articulate with the international system of nation states?  To what extent does the city system represent a different, competing logic?  This project is designed to address these questions, first by solving difficult data issues and by then using these data to carefully analyze, quantitatively through new network modeling procedures, the dimensions of global city networks over time and their correspondence (or lack of correspondence) to the international system of states.  The research will develop network measures (primarily through inter-city air transportation data) of the global city network, and it will analyze these data through novel network analytic procedures.

17099,NSF,HHS,"The Earth's surface is divided into a small number of tectonic plates that move as units.  The cold, upper part of the earth, called the lithosphere, is stiff, enabling the plates to move without significant internal deformation above a deformable, softer layer called the asthenosphere.  Thus, it is the physical properties of the lithosphere that control the surface expression of convection within the Earth's interior, enabling plate tectonics.  Despite its fundamental role in governing tectonics, the thickness of the lithosphere is difficult to measure. We propose to measure the azimuthal anisotropy of Rayleigh wave propagation within two ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) arrays in the western Pacific as a means of unambiguously determining the thickness of the old oceanic lithosphere.Thermal models of seafloor subsidence indicate that the oceanic plates should be ~ 90 - 125 km thick, with temperatures approaching steady state in very old seafloor.  In contrast, seismic surface wave studies indicate that velocities continue to increase as a function of age, with the velocity changes occurring at depths greater than the thickness of the best-fitting cooling slab models. The most direct and unambiguous way to determine the thickness of the lithosphere and to resolve this controversy is to map the transition from static structure frozen in the plate to actively deforming fabric in the convecting, deforming asthenosphere.  This change should induce a change in anisotropic fabric associated with the alignment of the mineral olivine in a deforming Earth, which we propose to detect by measuring the variation of azimuthal anisotropy of Rayleigh waves as a function of period.In a relatively small area of the western Pacific in seafloor approximately 155 million years old, there are major changes in the direction of spreading in seafloor of the same age and similar spreading rate.  Thus, the fossil component of anisotropy in the lithosphere should change direction dramatically, but the asthenospheric component due to flow beneath the plate should be nearly constant.  With a deployment of arrays of  OBSs where the spreading directions change, it should be possible to clearly distinguish the fossil component of anisotropy from the dynamically maintained component in the asthenosphere.  We will collect continuous seismic records of earthquakes occurring around the world.  In addition to measuring the azimuthal anisotropy of Rayleigh waves as a function of period, we will look for lateral heterogeneities in velocity within and in the vicinity of the arrays, measure shear wave splitting, P and S delays, and study the regional propagation of surface waves in the oldest parts of the Pacific.Broader Impacts. An important component of the proposed activity is education of students and communication with local public schools. Graduate students will be supported at Brown and at CalState Northridge and undergrads will work as assistants.    At least four students will participate in each of the two seagoing legs; a good way to introduce oceanography as a field to students.  Student participants will be expected to visit local elementary and middle schools before and after the cruise to communicate the excitement of going to sea and to prepare a daily weblog on board to communicate with the classes they have visited.  We expect that of the Brown University participants, at least 50% will be women, and we will attempt to recruit underrepresented minorities from the CalState Northridge student body.In addition to presentations at scientific conferences and publication in professional journals, we will work with our local press officers to prepare press releases to communicate findings to the general public.  Data gathered will be archived at the IRIS Data Management Center and made available to seismologists and the general public."

17142,NSF,HHS,"Physics (13)  The project goal is to develop a coherent, guided-inquiry, algebra-based physics course sequence for medium enrollment, general education settings. This sequence is especially suitable for low-cost implementation at small regional universities and community colleges, where the audience is often diverse and relatively under-prepared. To address the needs of this audience, the curriculum integrates conceptual and mathematical concepts through the general pedagogical structure of the successful Physics for Elementary Teachers (PET) curriculum, with the goal of helping students develop the critical thinking skills and understanding of science needed to become part of a scientifically literate citizenry. It also draws on elements from both Constructing Physics Understanding (CPU) and Visual Quantum Mechanics (VQM). The project has three main objectives:Curriculum Development: To use the general pedagogical structure of PET as a coherent framework within which the conceptual and mathematical aspects of the algebra-based sequence are integrated.Content Learning: To enable students to develop a deep understanding of the major conceptual themes of force, motion, and energy as they apply to mechanical, electrical and magnetic contexts, optics and select modern physics topics.Nature of Science: To enable students to develop scientific thinking skills such as evidence-based reasoning, utilizing graphs to represent and to show relationships between data, and to develop a deeper understanding of algebraic representations beyond focusing on simple numerical solutions. Intellectual merit: The curriculum developed in this project builds on a proven pedagogical structure to meet the need for a guided-inquiry algebra-based physics sequence suitable for diverse and under-prepared audiences. The course structure is based on recent research on science learning and incorporate proven pedagogical strategies such as activity-based instruction and collaborative/cooperative group learning. It also makes extensive use of technology to support student learning.Broader impacts: The LEAP curriculum benefits all students, but especially females and underrepresented groups, since the use of collaborative/cooperative learning has been shown to particularly benefit these groups. For secondary education majors, these courses are likely their only exposure to learning content in a guided-inquiry setting. In addition, the focus on improving students' scientific reasoning abilities, especially skills associated with graphical representations, helps all students become more scientifically literate citizens."
17146,NSF,HHS,"Technical: This project is to study molecular plasmonic materials. The methodology is to introduce tethered dyes onto the surface of flat gold nanoparticles in conjunction with a matrix monolayer. The resulting dye-molecule/gold-nanoparticle hybrid will be characterized by single nanoparticle spectroscopy (light scattering and fluorescence), atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and optical microscopy. Parameters to be investigated include the dye-flat gold nanoparticle spacing, orientation of transition dipoles with respect to the metal surface, absorption and fluorescence wavelength of the attached dyes, and patterned placement of dyes with respect to the particular flat gold nanoparticle's higher-order plasmon intensity pattern (mode structure). The project aims to establish general techniques for functionalizing and patterning surfaces of gold nanoparticles, and to experimentally test applications using nanoparticle?s higher-order plasmon modes for wavelength-controlled direction of photon energy. The project will also investigate the effect of adding two different dyes to spatially separated regions of the flat gold nanoparticle to further explore plasmon mediated fluorescence resonant energy transfer.Non-technical: The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of importance to materials science. Through an increased understanding of plasmonic materials, the project is expected to contribute to the development of practical devices such as optical detectors, optical switches, and chemical sensors. The project constitutes an effective integration of research and education through training of graduate and undergraduate students in a technologically significant area. Through the inherent interactions between the directed synthetic work in the chemistry laboratory and measurements in the physics laboratory, students will gain first-hand experience functioning in an interdisciplinary and integrated research program. The research project has synergistic overlap with an undergraduate nanotechnology lab that the co-PI has developed and an organic teaching lab the PI co-supervises. The undergraduate research support can extend the experience of students though hands-on experience in either of these collaborative research laboratories. Research dissemination will be through departmental web postings, presentations to undergraduates at institutional and regional research days, and presentations at conferences as well as publication."
17148,NSF,NSF,"A scientific symposium titled Low Dimensional Topology and Quantum Geometry will take place at the National Meeting of the Society for the Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in the Sciences (SACNAS) in Kansas City, Missouri on October 12, 2007. The two a priori disparate fields of low dimensional topology and quantum geometry are related through theoretical physics and string theory. Exciting progress has recently been made in each of these subjects independently, including a proof of the Weinstein conjecture in dimension three, and the degree-0 Donaldson-Thomas/Gromov-Witten duality. Important open conjectures motivate continued study; these include notonly the higher-degree Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas conjecture and the general Weinstein conjecture, but also such important topics as the Volume conjecture, the Crepant Resolution Conjecture. Furthermore, and central to our symposium, there are important conjectures relating these two sub jects. Most notable is Large N duality, relating Gromov-Witten theory to knot theory and low dimensional topology. The speakers at this symposium will announce accomplishments and also discuss new directions of research. Specifically, Joel Kamnitzer will give an introduction to knot theory and its relation to derived categories, Mariel Vazqeuz will discuss applications of knot theory, and Kevin Costello will discuss connections to Algebraic Geometry and Gromov-Witten theory. This symposium will enable and encourage students and other scientists to pursue research in areas related to the interaction of quantum geometry and low dimensional topology, provide the opportunity for scientists to interact and foster collaboration and new research, and disseminate knowledge to a wide and extraordinarily diverse audience. While the reasons for organizing a scientific symposium on low dimensional topology and quantum geometry are many, there is additionally an acute need to do so for an audience of underrepresented minorities. There is at this time significant underrepresentation of minorities in the mathematical sciences; this underrepresentation is evidently severe in both low dimensional topology and quantum geometry and certainly the intersection of these subjects. There are very important questions that need to be addressed in these subjects, and it is necessary to attract a broad and diverse audience to work on these problems. Gromov-Witten theory and related &#64257;elds have been extremely successful in solving outstanding problems, some over 100 years old, in several branches of mathematics and physics. Low dimensional topology is not only of basic importance in geometry and topology, but in several areas of applied mathematics as well, as highlighted in this symposium. It is predicted that underrepresented minorities will become the majority of United States Citizens; as such, it is in the long term interest of low dimensional topology and quantum geometry to have increased participation from members of these groups. Moreover, given the importance of these sub jects to mathematics and science in general, it is in our National interest to work against the underrepresentation of minorities conducting research in these fields. This symposium has been approved and scheduled by SACNAS. Further information about mathematics at SACNAS in general, and about this symposium in particular, can be found, respectively, at http://www.uprh.edu/~sacnas/ and http://math.berkeley.edu/~dkarp/sacnas/2007.html."

The project addresses phosphorus doping in epitaxial films on single crystal ZnO, phosphorus doping in non-polar ZnO films, co-doping ZnO with phosphorus and hydrogen, surface passivation, and formation and properties of ZnO pn homo- and heterojunctions. Characterization techniques, including temperature dependent Hall measurements, capacitance-voltage measurements, and low temperature photoluminescence, will be used to elucidate the behavior of phosphorus dopants in these materials. The overall objective of this project is to understand the synthesis and properties of ZnO-related pn homojunctions and heterojunctions in an effort to realize efficient p-type doping, minority carrier injection, and ultraviolet electroluminescence. Expected technological impacts include solid state lighting, thin film electronics and sensors. Understanding the doping of (Zn,Mg)O thin films will also be useful in the development of transparent conducting oxides, widely used as electrode materials in photovoltaic solar cells and light emitting displays. As wide band gap semiconductors, transparent conducting oxides are also attractive as active materials in transparent electric and optoelectronic technologies. Wide gap semiconducting oxides are attractive for transparent transistor development as they can be synthesized as thin films at lower temperatures that are compatible with various substrates, including glass. For chemical or biological sensors, the ability to fabricate pn junctions with ZnO-based materials opens the possibility of using the improved sensitivity of a high electron mobility transistor for sensor applications. Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science and condensed matter physics having technological relevance. Basic understanding gained is expected to lead to improved device performance, and to allow design of new components. The project integrates research and education providing students with hands-on laboratory experience and training while conducting forefront research. Educational impacts include UF graduate and undergraduate students, as well as opportunities for outreach to local high school students. In order to address the need to educate engineering graduate students about the relative role of specific technologies to energy consumption, the project?s activities will also include providing a tutorial on Energy Consumption and Technologies to be delivered as part of the Graduate Student Seminar Series in Materials Science. In order to enhance the exposure of undergraduate students to wide bandgap semiconducting oxide research, the project will incorporate undergraduates through an existing Senior Research Thesis program. The research activities will involve a Ph.D graduate student. For both graduate and undergraduates involvement, persons from underrepresented groups (women, minorities) will be particularly encouraged to participate."
17166,NSF,NSF,"Many phenomena in the physical sciences are governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDE). Almost all the problems in this proposal involve  peaks of concentration ; they correspond to small regions in space (often assimilated to points or lines) where some of the variables can take extremely high values. Such peaking zones can be part of the data or part of the unknown. For example, in nuclear physics, positive nuclei are fixed zones of high density surrounded by a diffuse cloud of electrons floating around them. A surprising mathematical discovery is that some natural NLPDE admit no solution when high-density data are concentrated in regions that are  too small.  In mathematical language, this can be expressed by saying that some measures (e.g., Dirac masses) are not admissible data. The principal investigator proposes to classify all admissible measures for a large class of NLPDE. In other problems, the zones of high concentration are part of the unknown. Singularities may appear when a  mild  external field is applied to the system. The examples of this phenomenon that are relevant to the current project arise in the physics of liquid crystals and superconductors. In this project, the principal investigator will continue his research in several directions, addressing such issues as the following: What kind of external action is required to produce singularities?  Describe the nature, the strength, and the location of singularities?In the real world, one often encounters phenomena of extreme intensity, which appear in small regions of space or persist only during a small time interval. A short list of examples includes the following: vortices (similar to tornadoes) in fluid mechanics and superconductors, fractures in solid mechanics, self-focusing beams in nonlinear optics (e.g., in lasers), defects in liquid crystals, black holes in astrophysics. One of the project?s goals is to describe all possible singular behaviors for a large class of nonlinear models. It is important to understand what causes such  blow-up  phenomena, in order either to avoid them or to enhance them. Mathematically similar problems occur not only in physics but in many other areas of mathematics."
17173,NSF,NSF,"Technical: This project aims to gain a quantitative understanding of the chemical contrast in atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with the ultimate objective of achieving a comprehensive knowledge of defects and interfaces in solids. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF or Z-contrast) imaging in STEM has been recognized as a technique that provides atomic structure images with chemical sensitivity. A quantitative understanding of the atomic number contrast in these images would allow for analysis of impurity or dopant atoms near interfaces and defects with atomic-level spatial resolution. Despite the significant progress that has been made over the last decade in the theory of STEM Z-contrast imaging a significant mismatch exists between predictions of image contrast made by theory and that of experimental images. While this discrepancy does not affect the interpretation of images of perfect crystals, it precludes a quantitative, atomic-scale chemical analysis of defects and interfaces. In this project, the physical origins of the disagreement between theory and experiments will be investigated in a systematic series of experiments designed to distinguish between contributions from instrumental, environmental and sample effects and those related to the scattering physics of high-energy electrons. In particular, the influence of temperature (phonon scattering), sample thickness, acceleration voltage, convergence angle, inelastic scattering, sample surface layers, point defects, and atom displacements on the image contrast will be examined. The experimental findings will be compared with simulation results, in collaboration with scientists at the University of Melbourne.Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance, and is expected to provide new scientific knowledge of structure and chemistry at the atomic scale, which is critical for advances in modern materials science and nanotechnology. The project will contribute to the interdisciplinary and international training of graduate students. Through collaboration with theorists in Australia, the students supported by the program will learn about the latest developments in theory, bridge the gap between applied and fundamental materials research, learn a broad range of scientific methods, and become trained in international collaboration. The project also offers two- to three-month-long, self-contained internships for undergraduate students. Results obtained in this project will be used to develop teaching modules for a web-based Electron Microscopy Database (EMdb) on the topic of quantitatively analyzing chemical contrast in atomic resolution imaging."
17186,NSF,NSF,"Vertical climbing, a behavior frequently performed by extant hominoids and atelines, has figured prominently in theories of locomotor evolution in the hominoids and hominins. For example, it has been proposed that vertical climbing pre-adapted hominins for bipedality.  However, whether Pliocene hominins or Miocene hominoids practiced vertical climbing is still a subject of debate. Kinematic work on wild chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, Uganda has shown that vertical climbing requires extreme foot dorsiflexion, coupled with foot inversion and abduction. It is thus hypothesized that the morphology of the ankle, or talocrural joint, in vertical climbing Old World anthropoids is (1) adapted for positions of extreme dorsiflexion, inversion, and abduction, and (2) adapted to withstand the forces incurred on the joint while being loaded in these foot positions. This project will examine the external and internal morphology of the ankle in thirteen species of living primates, including humans, to test whether vertical climbers have a distinct talocrural joint morphology. External morphology of the talocrural joint will be assessed using linear and angular properties of the tibia and talus. Furthermore, the complex shape of the ankle will be modeled using data obtained from 3D laser scans. The role of ankle ligaments in restricting joint motion and stabilizing the ankle will be determined by quantifying the specific location and shape of the bony attachments. Finally, the internal morphology of the talus will be examined using CT scans of modern anthropoid tali. To address whether extinct hominoids and hominins included vertical climbing in their locomotor repertoire, results obtained from the study of modern ankles will be applied to fossil tibia and tali, including CT scan data obtained from seven hominin tali from fossil localities in South Africa.This project examines the ankle joint across a wide range of modern primates to help reconstruct the locomotion of extinct apes and humans, and test whether early human ancestors were capable tree climbers. This project focuses specifically on the ankle joint to test whether the remarkable tree climbing ability of modern apes has a deep history, and whether vertical tree climbing may have been a precursor to human bipedality. Because the ankle joint is so often injured in modern humans, this study will also track the evolutionary history of ankle ligaments using fossil tibia and tali to determine the timing of and circumstances leading to our modern ankle anatomy."
17216,NSF,HHS,"0802583ZralyThe International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Maggie Zraly to work with Dr. Joseph Ntaganira at National University of Rawanda.Over the last two decades, youth headed households have emerged and proliferated in Africa south of the Sahara, signaling a reconfiguration of long-standing family patterns.  During this same time, Rwanda has undergone civil war and genocide, followed by an era of  reconstruction involving free-market reforms, privatization, and a huge influx of foreign aid, contributing to the intense concentration wealth in a minority of the population.  The burgeoning of youth headed households in post-genocide Rwandan society presents a valuable opportunity to examine the cultural process of resilience among a generation of youth who are growing up amidst widespread social transformations never before seen in the world. This collaboration will investigate the interplay between social inequality and resilience in peer networks among youth heads of household (YHH) in Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda.  The purpose of the study is to understand patterns of variability in vulnerability to sexual coercion, HIV risk, and emotional experience and expression among YHH, especially with respect to gender. Where YHH connect with peers who share similar experiences and problems, it is expected that resilience in peer networks will be a cultural source of hope and courage to overcome threats encountered in everyday life.  However, it is also expected that where YHH are socially excluded from, or must compete for, access to the support of peer networks, they will be more likely to be driven into coercive sexual relationships offering economic benefits and carrying considerable risk for HIV infection. This research strengthens anthropology?s engagement with human phenomena typically approached through epidemiology and psychology (i.e. resilience, emotion, risk, and vulnerability), and extends theorizing on how social inequality is actually experienced, negotiated, and shaped by youth in cultural context, as well as how it patterns vulnerability to disease.  This project will build the capacity of a female postdoctoral researcher from the United States to forge long-term collaborative relationships with scientists in Rwanda.  It will also promote the participation of YHH in science education, and enhance the basic social science training of graduate level Rwandan public health researchers."
17224,NSF,NSF,"This CISE special project award provides funding to the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Academy of Sciences to hold two workshops to explore the nature of computational thinking and its cognitive and educational dimensions. The first workshop focuses on the nature of computational thinking. The second workshop focuses on the cognitive and educational dimensions of computational thinking, particularly for K-12 students and teachers.  A report for each workshop is to be developed to summarize and synthesize discussions, compare and contrast the views of the invited expert participants, and identify common ground and areas for moving forward. The reports are to be disseminated widely in both computing and educational communities.The intellectual merit lies in the importance of the topic of computational thinking to the computing and education communities and the potential to advance discovery and transformative research based on the outcomes of the meeting. The National Academy of Sciences has an outstanding track record in promoting this kind of national dialogue and engaging individuals with significant expertise to address and move forward issues and concepts critical to the scientific community.  The project develops a clear understanding of the central elements of computational thinking as well as the cognitive aspects, thus forming the basis for new research in an area critical to computing and education.The broader impacts lie in sound development of a fundamental analytical skill that is ultimately relevant to everyone.  Progress toward incorporating computational thinking into K-12 education could impact not only on the future development of K-12 education but also on the skill set of future members of the workforce, both in the sciences and more broadly."
17227,NSF,NSF,"This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project proposes the development of the design features, sensory system and the control algorithm of an integrated powered knee-ankle power regenerative prosthesis. Despite significant advances in lower limb prosthetics over the past decade, all presently commercially available lower limb prostheses incorporate passive ankle joints. That is, the joints of the prostheses can either store or dissipate energy, but cannot provide any net power over a gait cycle. The inability to deliver joint power significantly impairs the ability of these prostheses to restore many locomotive functions, including level walking, walking up stairs, walking up slopes, running, and jumping, all of which require significant net positive power at the knee joint, ankle joint, or both. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the use of integrated powered knee and ankle joints in transfemoral prostheses that use sensory information from the ground and the wearer. The hypothesis is that a prosthesis with actively powered knee and ankle joints will significantly enhance the mobility of transfemoral amputees while walking on level grounds, as well as stairs and slopes.The proposed work will result in new theoretical frameworks for both the control, sensory system, and design of such systems. Major intellectual contributions will include the design of power systems; development of the sensory system to obtain information from the ground and from the user; the development of a control framework for the interactive control of prostheses; and the development of adaptive and robust controllers for impedance modulation during locomotion. This project intends to create principles that provide significantly greater functional capabilities for above-knee amputees. Specifically, the proposed work will enable more natural, stable, and adaptable prostheses. These research elements in this proposal will also form a foundation for powered orthotic systems. Additional significant benefits of this work include fostering a broader awareness and increased sensitivity of young engineers and educational institutions to disability issues. Limb loss also affects a growing number of military personnel serving in recent conflicts, as well as a far larger number of veterans from previous wars."
17260,NSF,NSF,"Technical:This single investigator research program systematically investigates transport phenomena associated with single point defects.  The electronic scattering, localization, and fluctuation associated with a point defect ultimately limit what is practically achievable in electronics, and industry's ability to design and build electronic circuits at ever smaller scales is limited by control over these sites.  While such topics have been extensively treated theoretically, few experimental platforms are available for making direct measurements.  In this project, the experimental platform consists of one-dimensional conduction through single-walled carbon nanotubes.  In this one-dimensional limit, the alteration of single bonds is sufficient to dramatically alter electronic behavior, providing a window into the transport regime where atomic-scale effects become measurable, distinguishable, and reproducible.  The measurement of nanotube circuits both before and after defect creation very directly identifies the interplay between point defects and electronic effects, in order to map out reproducible electronic features associated with different chemical terminations.  By using conductance spectroscopy, local scanning probe techniques, noise spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, and in situ characterization during annealing, this project aims to complete a controlled and systematic study relevant to nanoscale physics and the semiconductor industry.  Furthermore, all of the work will be completed by graduate and undergraduate students in a training environment designed to expose junior researchers to problems and techniques relevant to future careers in science.Non-Technical:Modern transistors, memory elements, and all of the wiring that connects them continue to shrink from one generation of products to the next.  In extreme cases, the films of material that make up these circuit elements are already only a few atoms thick.  The semiconductor industry anticipates that, in the near future, more and more devices will cross into this limit where success or failure can depend on the accidental presence or absence of individual atom.  In order to forecast what kinds of effects science and industry will observe in this limit, this project fabricates and tests electronic circuits that intentionally contain single atomic defects.  The experimental platform, which uses carbon nanotube conductors only a few atoms wide, directly accesses the limit where atomic scale effects can become measurable, distinguishable, and reproducible.  Undergraduate and graduate students are trained to test nanotube circuits before and after the incorporation of single atomic defects, and to identify the electronic changes that result.  This degree of control allows the electronic consequences of atomic defects to be systematically investigated and, through further chemical tailoring, corrected for in practical devices.  Combined with a unique educational program in Materials Physics, this project provides junior researchers with both practical and theoretical understanding of looming issues in next generation electronic devices, and the relevant techniques for solving them."

17280,NSF,HHS,"This project involves a series of experiments with interacting cold atoms in far-off-resonance optical lattices. Arrays of coupled and independent one-dimensional gases of bosons will be prepared and studied to help resolve some outstanding mysteries of quantum statistical mechanics and quantum phase transitions. Prior experiments by this group have explored the physics of Bose-gases in one dimension, demonstrating that these gases never thermalize.  New experiments will relax the one-dimensional confinement of atoms in several ways and explore the crossover between one-dimensional and three-dimensional behavior.  These experiments will address a long open theoretical question of the existence of a threshold for chaos in a many-body quantum system, as there is in classical mechanics.   This project may clarify how irreversibility of macroscopic behavior arises from the reversible behavior of individual atoms. Additionally the research will involve studies of arrays of coupled one-dimensional gases, an analog of Josephson junction arrays.  Various phase transitions and dimensional crossovers will be studied with a high degree of control, allowing them to serve as models for a wide range of phenomena observed in more complicated systems. The broader impacts of these experiments lie in the ability of cold-atom experiments to provide answers to long-open questions in nonlinear dynamics and mathematical physics.  The research project will also improve the technology for creation and manipulation of Bose-Einstein Condensates with all-optical techniques.   They will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in technologically important areas of physics."
17289,NSF,HHS,"The theory of dynamical systems studies the time-evolution of complicated, multi-component systems, like particle systems in statistical physics, reaction kinetics from chemistry, the behavior of the atmosphere (hence the relevance in weather forecasting), population dynamics, developments on the stock market, etc. By nature, this theory is closely related to - and is partly arising from - the theory of differential equations and stochastic processes. An interesting feature of the theory of dynamical systems is that it helps us better understand such crucial phenomena in the time evolution of the above mentioned systems, as the high sensitivity of the solution to initial conditions, sometimes referred to as chaos, or chaotic behavior. My present proposal targets the investigation and better understanding of a popular and important class of mostly chaotically behaving mathematical models, namely the so called mathematical billiards. They got their name after the fact that they model the physical motion of ball shaped particles interacting with each other via elastic collisions.   Due to the above said, this project is primarily devoted to a special class of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems with singularities, namely hyperbolic, or at least partially hyperbolic mathematical billiards. Such systems have been playing an important role in the rigorous mathematical foundation of statistical physics, so that studying them and establishing their ergodic and statistical properties is getting more and more physical relevance. The main part of the proposal focuses on a the final steps in proving a fundamental conjecture regarding hard ball systems, namely the so called  Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Hypothesis , which states that any finite system of (totally elastic) hard spheres moving on a flat torus is fully hyperbolic and ergodic, of course, on the level set of its trivial first integrals. The proof of this conjecture (in its full generality) up until now has been notoriously withstanding any attack against it. The hardest part in presenting an inductive proof (induction on the number of interacting spheres) has been so far proving the so called  Ansatz , a global dynamical-geometric condition, claiming the almost sure hyperbolicity of singular orbits inside the realm of all singular trajectories.  Since by now I got extremely close to make the closing steps in this big project that spanned over a couple decades of hard research work of several people, I can now confidently include finishing the proof of this hypothesis as the first major part of the recent proposal. Furthermore, this plan also contains my promise to join efforts with my colleague N. I. Chernov to publish a comprehensive book on the complete proof of the Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Hypothesis. The goal of publishing such a volume is two-fold: First, it would provide a comprehensive exposition of this theory with a unified system of notations, references, etc. for easier reading. Secondly, it would more thoroughly and clearly explain many involved technicalities of the theory, in order to make it accessible for a wider group of researchers of dynamical systems.  The subsequent parts of the proposal contain blueprints for further research in this direction by generalizing the original Boltzmann-Sinai Hypothesis to cylindric billiards, and billiards in physically more relevant containers, i. e. rectangular boxes, convex domains, etc. These sections also address some further open problems in the theory of mathematical billiards that still remain open after my attampts to prove them in my previous research period. Their list can be found in the detailed description of the current proposal."

17344,NSF,NSF,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will extend the capabilities of magnetic current imaging to detect open failures in semiconductor packages with an accuracy of 30 microns to facilitate the integration of semiconductor components and devices into systems. The largest, most difficult problem encountered in packages is electrical opens due to increasing shrinking and complex technology in leading edge designs. The only available techniques are time domain reflectometry with practical resolution of 1-2 mm and time consuming layer-by-layer deprocessing. It is proposed to use magnetic current imaging with a SQUID sensor to solve this critical problem through increasing the frequency detection limit of the equipment to detect high frequency signals at the defect location.The semiconductor industry has a critical need for localization of buried open defects in packages with resolution below 30 microns. The proposed technology is targeting a 30 micron resolution to fill a known gap in fault isolation technology for packaging. For the semiconductor companies it will enable the packaging manufacturing sites to isolate open defects and improve their manufacturing processes to minimize or eliminate these defects quickly so that they can get high quality reliable products to market faster."
17379,NSF,NSF,"The goal of this work is to examine the mechanical processes that attend the packaging and ejection of genomic DNA in viruses.   The research links theoretical models of the ejection process with single-molecule experiments aimed at testing the predictions of the theory.  The theoretical models are based upon a treatment of the energetic cost to bend the DNA molecule  in conjunction with the energy of interaction between the charges  along the double-stranded DNA helix.  Until now, these mechanical measurements have only been carried out in in vitro studies in which the viruses are taken out of their natural context.  These earlier studies will be complemented by experiments aimed at watching individual infection events as viruses deliver their genomic DNA into bacteria.This work merges biological and mechanical perspectives to develop quantitative understanding of the life cycles of bacterial viruses.  Further, this work should be seen as a specific case study in a broader analysis of the physical principles underlying how both viruses and cells manage their genomes.     An extensive outreach effort  carried out at Caltech and known as physical biology bootcamp will use the single-molecule experiments in intensive laboratory courses held every summer.

17409,NSF,HHS,"The Earth has a metallic core and a separate silicate mantle. They separated from one another very early in Earth's history. This separation is the most fundamental chemical differentiation of the planet. The objective of this project is to learn more about the timing and geochemical details of the separation process(es) because the footprint of the separation appears in the residual abundances in the mantle of elements that should have predominantly joined the core. It is unclear whether the interaction of the core and mantle is ongoing in the sense of a continuing separation, a static steady state, or a reactive regurgitation. It is also the purpose of this project to learn about the state and mechanisms of core-mantle interaction. Much of the project activities are focused on the analysis of the isotopic composition and abundance of siderophile (core joining) element Os in rocks thought to be related to the rise of deep plumes from the core-mantle boundary. If material from the core is incorporated in deep plumes, the isotopic composition of Os may reflect the production of radiogenic Os from radioactive Pt and Re. Pt and Re are enriched in the core compared to the mantle and decay to specific isotopes of Os providing a signature to recognize such interactions. In order to fully evaluate any such signals confirmed, it is necessary to know the geochemical behavior of these siderophile materials across core and mantle systems. Experimental laboratory investigations are directed towards this behavior at high pressure and temperature. Technical problems for laboratory experiments and their analysis, and possibly also for interpreting natural rock chemistry, are presented by the occurrence of noble metal micro-nuggets as the physical host to Os and other Pt-group elements. The investigators have developed a technique using both the isotopic composition and abundance of Os to infer the behavior of Os, stripped of the nugget effect. They propose to extend this technique to Pt, another siderophile element of key importance in understanding the core-mantle system."

17490,NSF,NSF,"The Principal Investigators (PIs) will conduct a multi-institution, integrated study encompassing several core science foci of the second Verification of the Origin of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX2) to be held in 2009.  In support of this research, and in support of the overall VORTEX2 program, the PIs will field several core VORTEX2 instrumentation systems. The field-project and analysis effort will permit the coordinated collection of multi-platform measurements and their integrated analysis. The diverse data sets will result from fixed and mobile radars, mobile mesonets, and in situ instrumentation with the goal of developing a more comprehensive scientific understanding of the genesis, maintenance, and structure of tornadoes and supercells and their relationship to the environment. This study will combine integrated analyses with those of less comprehensive data from over 130 tornadoes obtained during the Radar Observations of Thunderstorms And Tornadoes Experiment (ROTATE) program (1996-2007).  Scientific Motivation and Intellectual Merit: Current level of understanding in several areas of tornado science fails to provide answers to fundamental questions including the true range of sizes, intensities, and structures of tornadoes.  The factors governing the occurrence and timing of tornado genesis, growth, intensification, maintenance, and dissipation, as well as the modes of genesis, are hypothesized from previous work, but remain largely unvalidated observationally, as do details concerning vertical wind field profiles, and the evolution and structure of damaging winds near the ground. The specific role of downdrafts in tornadogenesis and the sensitivity of the tornadogenesis process to microphysical and thermodynamic characteristics are not known. Thus, while significant advances have been made in addressing many of these questions using data from the original VORTEX and from ROTATE; these results have been limited.  Specifically, VORTEX2 will provide an integration of multiple-Doppler mobile radar data with comprehensive in situ thermodynamic data that has not been achieved previously. Broader Impacts: Improved understanding of tornado genesis, maintenance, structure, and environmental dependencies will have a broad impact on the ability to detect, warn, and forecast these severe events and to reduce subsequent casualties. The fielding of mobile Doppler radars, mobile mesonets, and in situ thermodynamic probes will be led by the PIs.

17507,NSF,NSF,"Objective: The need for storing and accessing large amounts of data with the ease of being portable is apparent from the ubiquitous use of small form factor consumer electronics where demands for terabit per inch square areal densities is predicted. Conventional modes of data storage are reaching fundamental limitations on the areal densities achievable. Probe based data storage solutions, based on atomic force microscopy principles employ a force probe that has the resolution to image data at the atomic scale. Information is stored in the form of indentations that are a few square nanometers in area. Probe based high density data storage has the promise of delivering a few terabit per square inch densities in the near term. The dynamic mode probe based data storage platform will be developed under the proposal goals.Intellectual Merit: A real-time model of the probe dynamics will be developed for high density data storage applications. The dynamic mode operation that leads tosignificantly smaller forces on the media and the probe will be employed as compared to the static mode operation that has been used in previous work. The fundamental tradeoff between the speed of reading the data and the resolution of the read data existing in current dynamic modes is overcome, leading to two orders increase in the detection speed. The physical modelling part of the proposal will provide an appropriate level abstraction of the forces appearing between the probe and media that remains tractable and is sufficient for data storage purposes. The communication system modelling and design objectives part will develop a communication channel model of the data storage system. Efficient and high performance detectors and error control codeswill be developed for the system.Broader impacts: The proposal objectives if achieved will directly impact theconsumer electronics market and will provide a small form factor high density data storage alternative. Synergistic transfer of know how between the academia and industry by exchanging student visits and presenting specialized workshops will be achieved. A new course on probe based data storage that bridges the know how between the systems and physics communities will be developed."
17516,NSF,HHS,"AbstractECCS-0801924S. Khondaker, University of Central FloridaThe objective of this research is to design, fabricate and characterize a novel planar gated organic photovoltaic device (OPV) with in-plane cathode and anode deposited from different metals. The approach is to (i) fabricate interdigitated electrode arrays by a combination of optical and electron beam lithography on a doped silicon substrate, (ii) deposit active layers of different thickness, and (iii) characterize device performance by photocurrent imaging, and room- and low temperature transport measurements.Intellectual Merit: A novel planar electrode OPV with integrated back gate will be fabricated. In contrast to existing OPV?s, this new device will (i) allow independent control of active layer thickness and electrode spacing, (ii) eliminate the need for transparent electrodes giving more flexibility in choice of materials, and (iii) allow in-situ field effect mobility measurements. Device properties will be correlated directly with the figures of merit of the device under investigation. This will lead to high efficiency OPVs by offering better charge mobility, enhanced charge transport and collection efficiency, and device manufacturing methods.Broader Impact: Successful demonstration of the planar gated OPV will have significant impact towards realization of high efficiency, low cost organic solar cells. For educational development and outreach the investigators propose: (i) training of female and minority students, high school students and teachers, (ii) development of a new graduate course on energy and nanoscience, and (iii) community outreach through internet, news letters, exhibitions at the Orlando Science Center, and Florida Solar Energy Center."

The observatory is designed to study the origin and nature of the highest energy particles ever observed, namely cosmic rays with energies greater than 10^19 eV, by measuring their energy, their composition, and the distribution of arrival directions with large statistics and careful control of systematic effects.  The Southern PAO, nearing completion in Malargue, Argentina, is the first hybrid detector to combine the two best-developed techniques of measuring showers caused by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The observatory detects shower particles that reach the surface with a surface array and the longitudinal development of the shower through the fluorescence produced in the atmosphere. This combination is essential for accurate energy measurements and reliable composition studies. The integration of theory, observations, and experiments at UC into a single effort has greatly benefited both the research goals and the training of students by involving them in all aspects of science: from the construction and operation of the PAO to the analysis of its data. This project will solidify the international leadership in the analysis and interpretation of the PAO data at UC.The discovery of the origin of the highest energy particles will impact both astrophysics and particle physics. The Southern PAO has had a major impact on public education and outreach throughout the participating countries across the globe: from Argentina to Vietnam. In collaboration with the Auger Visitors Center, the Malargue Planetarium, and the Adler Planetarium, the UC effort strengthens the depth of physics and astrophysics content of the education and public outreach efforts by promoting the 3D and 2D visualizations developed at UC of the highest energy showers, their detection methods, and possible cosmic origins. In collaboration with the American Natural History Museum, the group will develop a Science Bulletin that will further provide the public access to this fascinating mystery."
17530,NSF,NSF,"The concept of stress has been employed in anthropological research as a means to examine how individuals respond to environmental or psychosocial challenges. Researchers who study stress and its effects on immune function generally examine individual response to shifting environmental conditions or stressful experiences. Rather than focusing on the stress of environmental conditions acting on an adaptable body, this project will examine the particular circumstance wherein an individual's body is shifting in relation to relatively fixed biological and cultural categories. The purpose of this research is to further develop our understanding of human variation in stress response and immune function in relation to shifting degrees of perceived cultural consonance and role incongruity. Variation in stress response, effects on immune function, and factors that may moderate these responses, will be examined in a sample of people who are utilizing exogenous hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) or other procedures.  This study will focus on the liminal or intermediary portion of the transition process during which time individuals may occupy an ambiguous social category.  Levels of salivary cortisol, salivary testosterone, Epstein Barr Virus antibodies, ambulatory blood pressure, psychological and physical symptoms of stress, and levels of self-esteem will be examined in relation to cultural consonance with perceived social categories.  Biological, social, and psychological factors associated with symptoms of stress, levels of self-esteem, and variation in stress response will be identified. The study will be carried out in New York City, Boston, and rural western Massachusetts, which will allow for comparisons to take place between individuals living in small towns and urban centers, where cultural categories may vary. This research will also contribute methodologically to the field of anthropology through its combined use of quantitative and qualitative approaches and through its use of multiple physiological measures of stress response. A model of this sort could then be applied to situations where individuals are experiencing periods of liminality as a consequence of shifts occurring in their social identities (i.e. aging, illness, pregnancy, and disability.) This research will contribute to understanding physiological responses to cultural categories.  This type of model is broadly applicable to understanding how individuals react to other biocultural shifts such as aging, illness, pregnancy, and disability."
17592,NSF,NSF,"The proposed research concerns theoretical and computational issues arising in the context of generalized linear and mixed effects models. A new multivariate model is suggested as a construct for analysis of covariance which provides a unified framework for adjusting treatment means in balanced and unbalanced design settings. Second, a new approximation for the number of contingency tables and tables of zeros and ones, meeting certain linear constraints, is proposed. This is relevant, for example, in determining the feasibility of exact conditional analysis of log-linear models. The approximation arises from a novel formulation of the problem in terms of a generalized linear model for geometric responses. The approximation is much more generally applicable, and appears to be far more accurate, than exiting competitors. Third, a practical fitting algorithm for a broad class of mixed effects models with analytically intractable likelihood functions is proposed. The approach involves an implementation of the Monte Carlo EM algorithm that uses a randomized spherical-radial integration rule at the E-step. Use of this integration rule reduces the required Monte Carlo sample size by two orders of magnitude in test cases.Statistical models are ubiquitous in almost all areas of modern research, including such diverse fields as agriculture, economics, medicine, and sociology. Advances in computing power enable statisticians to consider models and do calculations that were not feasible even a few years ago. This research targets three problems related to widely-used statistical models. The first concerns a technique for adjusting treatment means in designed experiments to account for observed covariates related to the response of interest. This is a classical problem with its roots in agricultural field trials. The technique has a long history dating back to the mid-20th century. It is somewhat surprising then that there is still disagreement on the correct way to make the adjustments, even in simple balanced experiments. An explanation is that the mathematical tools and computing power necessary for a complete solution were not available when the method was first developed. The second problem relates to the feasibility of exact statistical tests when data is sparse, and the standard approximations break down. Exact methods are used, for example, in medical studies testing for factors associated with various diseases. Finally, a new fitting algorithm is proposed for an important class of statistical models. Test cases suggest that the methods will significantly extend the range of models for which the computations are practically feasible."
17593,NSF,NSF,"ABSTRACT ECCS- 0801985R. Haglund, Vanderbilt UniversityObjective: The objective of this project is to show how plasmon dynamics in composite metal-vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanostructures can be modulated by the reversible semiconductor-to-metal transition (SMT) in VO2.  Intellectual Merit: The SMT will be initiated by localized adiabatic heating using a scanning-probe tip, and by ultrafast laser excitation using standard prism coupling schemes.   Plasmon dynamics will be tracked using femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, plasmon microscopy and a novel, dual apertureless scanning-probe tip scheme for detecting plasmon propagation. During the first year, we will measure the ultrafast localized surface-plasmon resonance (LSPR) response and surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) propagation on nanohole arrays comprising bi-layer films (Ag or Au on VO2) and on VO2-covered nanoparticle arrays (Ag or Au).   In the sec-ond year, we will fabricate various VO2:metal composite nanostructures such as non-spheroidal nanoparticles, nanospirals and nanoholes surrounded by grooved diffractive structures.  We will investigate the effects of local curvature, size and morphology, and of excitation by linearly and circularly polarized light, on LSPR and SPP dynamics.  In the third year, we will fabricate SPP waveguides such as nanoparticle chains (Au-VO2-Au ? ellipsoidal chains and Au-Au ? chains capped with VO2) and nanowire or nanochannel geometries. These SPP-guiding structures are expected to exhibit interesting effects due to induced magnetization, polarization and dispersion that will be tracked via their signatures in the visible optical spectrum.  These experiments will point the way to modulating SPP propagation in nanostructures that could serve as prototypes for a variety of plasmonic devices.   Broader Impact: The technology will be a demonstration of an ultrafast broadband switch in the near-infrared communications spectral bands.  The fundamental understanding of plasmon-photon coupling and plasmon dynamics is expected to result in industrial  spin-off  benefits. Ad-ditionally, the project will result in the dissemination of new knowledge through the training of junior scientists in an international, cross-institutional collaborative environment and a web-based graduate seminar course in nanoplasmonics that will be available to the scientific com-munity."

NSF supported STEM disciplines: Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science, Education, Mathematical Sciences, Physics, and Technology. This project will build upon the existing partnership between ETSU and North Side Elementary, a school located within an older neighborhood in Johnson City, TN (population 57,000). North Side Elementary is a low-performing school with declining enrollment; approximately 95% of the students receive free or reduced price lunches, and was at risk of closure. Instead, the school has been classified as a signature school of science and mathematics, and has received school board approval to launch an exciting experiment to base the entire K-5 curriculum at North Side on Science. The Science First! GK-12  project  seeks to strengthen and expand the partnership between ETSU and North Side Elementary leading to the following outcomes: fellows and teachers will create classroom materials for an entire, stand-alone K-5 curriculum that is standards-based, science-driven, and science-motivated; these materials will be class tested, assessed, published, and widely disseminated; and Johnson City?s unified Middle School and Junior High School administrators will work with the PIs, fellows and teachers to plan for similar curricular revision at the 6-9 grade levelsThis project?s Intellectual Merit is the potential to affect every student in a small school with an enrollment of 300. It is expected that about 500 children who are either in school or enter kindergarten during the life of the grant will be directly affected by the new curriculum. A complete set of curricular materials will be developed, leading to the potential to launch a curricular event of large national impact, since interdisciplinary education driven by science will be a model that others might wish to emulate,  This projects  will immerse students in an interdisciplinary curriculum that will enjoy local and national attention, involvement of parents, efforts to continue the project at the middle school level, and the potential for replication and adaptation, all oh which contribute to  ?broader impact? of the project."
17620,NSF,NSF,"In the near future the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will come on line providing an unprecedented opportunity for particle theorists to probe the nature of fundamental interactions in the Tera-electronvolt region. The PIs present a detailed program for the analysis of event signatures at the LHC that would provide the key to the discovery of new physics. Analysis of such new physics in the framework of grand unified theories (GUTS), string theories, and theories based on D branes are proposed, including issues related to quark-charged lepton- neutrino textures and proton stability. Updated signatures for detection of possible TeV-scale black holes will be explored. The effects of possible TeV-scale string excitations in multi-gluon scattering amplitudes underlying multi-jet production processes will be investigated. It is also proposed to test models of CP violation in sparticle (Supersymmetric partners of Standard model particles) production and decays (in the CMS and the ATLAS detectors) at the LHC and from the data on B decays from LHCb. Additionally, physics of extra U(1)'s which may be the remnants of GUTs and strings below the symmetry breaking scale will be investigated. In the field of particle astrophysics, a major neutrino telescope (IceCube) will be operating at full acceptance in several years, and a number of high energy gamma ray facilities are online now or will be so in the very near future.The research proposed will show how measurements at these installations, as well as at the Pierre Auger Laboratory ground array, can permit simultaneous advances in astrophysics and particle physics, probing TeV scale black holes, quantum decoherence, non-seesaw origin of light neutrino masses and neutrino stability. The proposed research projects of this proposal will contribute in an important way to the discovery of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Such a discovery will have important implications for the development of high energy theory, string theory and particle-astrophysics in the coming decades. One of the PIs, Tomasz Taylor,is the coordinator of the Boston Theorynet outreach program.  This program aims at explaining to general audiences what theoretical physicists do  to students in high school classrooms and to teachers in individual meetings with theorists. Its main component is the direct interaction between physicists, high school students and teachers, through question and answer sessions and presentations during regular class hour visits and after class."
17624,NSF,NSF,"The research explores connections between gauge theory and quantum aspects of gravitational physics, particularly the concept of emergent geometry and emergent strings in the AdS/CFT correspondence. Some of the topics to be studied are aspects of higher dimensional geometry as seen from gauge theory. Part of this program is to study states that preserve some supersymmetries. The other part is to study non-commutative structures. The PI will focus on aspects of integrability in Yang Mills theories. The PI is also interested in exploring the non-commutative Geometric Aspects of emergent gravity in gauge theory.  He  plans to work on various condensed matter physics problems where the phase transitions are of a topological nature.  Using topological quantum field theory techniques, the PI proposes to study the properties of graphenes and the spin Hall effect. As to the broader impacts, The PI has several collaborators in China and in the Asia-Pacific region. Support of ongoing collaborations with them will make it possible to bring top students, postdocs and professors, including those from under-served demographic groups and those from Asia Pacific and Latin America, to Utah, to promote international exchange of scientists."

Network information theoryconsiders more general models of communication andoffers some bound on the limits of information transferin a communication system involving multiple sendersand receivers.This research fuses aspects of network optimizationtheory and network information theory in order to findand specify new limits of information transfer acrossa communication network.  The investigators use thetwo-way channel from information theory as a generalmodel of the transmission medium between neighboringprocessors of a communication network and addressfundamental optimization problems pertaining to theanalysis and design of networks of two-way channels.The investigators seek optimal routing algorithms inmulticast settings and a broad classification ofsituations where network coding can or cannot improveupon routing.  The investigators further aim tocategorize network scenarios in which a bidirectedcut set bound derived using information theoreticarguments is tight and to explore a network informationcounterpart to Kirchoff's law when the bidirectedcut set bound is not tight.  The research alsoinvolves extending the notion of minimal cost flowas an initial approach to treating quality-of-serviceissues and devising networks with least cost orcapacity that meet requirements on information transfer."
17643,NSF,NSF,"The research objective of this project is to study the effect of hurricane induced waves on highway bridge structures in coastal areas.  For this, the project we will (1) conduct a series of wave-bridge physical model tests under the assumption of a completely rigid bridge, (2) conduct a second series of wave-bridge physical model tests for a flexible structure, modeling the sway of the bridge using two sets of springs of known stiffness, and (3) conduct a preliminary numerical model investigation to evaluate the performance of an existing fluid-structure model. The research combines expertise in coastal engineering to analyze the wave forcing and structural engineering to analyze the bridge response.  Deliverables include developing a fundamental relationship between the wave characteristics (significant wave height and period), geometry (bridge deck, air gap, and water depth), and response (wave loads).  A second relationship will be developed to provide probabilities of the extreme wave loads exceeding their certain values for given sea state and problem geometry.The results of this research will provide new insights into the failure mechanisms of highway bridges subjected to hurricane wave loads, similar to the bridge failures along the US Gulf of Mexico coast during hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Katrina in 2005. The new relationships between wave characteristics and bridge response will provide tools for engineers to evaluate the risk of failure for existing bridges to hurricanes and to design new and retrofit existing bridges to withstand these loads. One graduate student is trained on this project. The research results will be disseminated through journal papers and conference presentations.  The project is integrated in an existing K-12 outreach program at the NSF NEES Tsunami Facility at Oregon State University."

17696,NSF,NSF,"CBET-0756054FinneranBiologically-produced hydrogen is one option for hydrogen fuel cells, and represents a sustainable form of energy if the process can be optimized to generate a significant yield.  Clostridium beijerinckii is one fermentative microorganism that has been used for bio-hydrogen production.  Results to date suggest that yields are quite low unless a) large quantities of carbon are used as a substrate and b) reactor volumes are large enough to generate significant biogas.  Our goal for this work is to increase the hydrogen yield by providing excess reducing equivalents in the form of reduced, extracellular hydroquinones, which are converted directly to hydrogen.  Extracellular quinones are referred to as electron shuttles.  They cycle electrons between mixed biological and abiotic interactions or between microorganisms in coupled biological interactions.  Initial data demonstrate the C. beijerinckii will oxidize anthrahydroquinone disulfonate (AH2QDS) to anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS) with concomitant hydrogen production.  The AQDS molecule is not consumed, and it is therefore available for re-reduction and oxidation.  If this cycle is maintained then all reducing equivalents from the AH2QDS will be used for hydrogen production, which provides excess electrons relative to standard fermentation.  Our goal is to characterize the physiology and develop a continuous, binary culture with a fermentative culture plus an AQDS-reducing microorganism to generate hydrogen via reduced electron shuttles.Intellectual MeritThe objectives of the proposed work are to: a.) confirm that electron shuttles (hydroquinones) are oxidized in fermentative metabolism leading to H2 production, b.) quantify the kinetics of H2 generation from reduced electron shuttles, c.) understand the chemical and biological factors that increase or decrease this pathway, and d.) develop a continuous culture (singular culture first and then eventual binary culture) to understand how this strategy can be applied to engineered systems for hydrogen gas recovery.  We will use both single cultures of C. beijerinckii and binary cultures of C. beijerinckii and Geobacter metallireducens.  G. metallireducens can oxidize the acetate and butyrate produced during glucose fermentation, and couples this oxidation to AQDS reduction to form AH2QDS.  The extracellular AH2QDS can then be oxidized by C. beijerinckii in a coupled biological reaction, regenerating the AQDS and completing the electron shuttling cycle.  The electron equivalents in the acetate and butyrate are in essence ?shuttled? to the fermentative cells via a carrier that specifically generates hydrogen when provided to the fermentative culture.  We will quantify the up regulation of key fermentative redox enzymes using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (Q-RT-PCR) related to AH2QDS oxidation.  The binary culture will be tested first in batch experiments (static bottles) and then in continuous culture with a stirred tank reactor.  The concentration of AQDS in the reactor will be adjusted to increase or decrease the hydrogen yield, such that we can predict the efficiency of the reaction relative to electron shuttle concentration.  Finally, the results with purified substrates (e.g. glucose) will be adapted to continuous systems with non-purified substrates such as complex starch in plant waste and ethanol production waste.Broader ImpactsThe broader impacts of the proposed work will be felt in all environmental engineering sectors from academia to consulting, as sustainable energy production is a critical theme emerging within all of these arenas.  Although the work is at it starting point and still quite far from commercial application or industrial use, the data do suggest a unique approach for producing biological hydrogen that is very different from standard fermentative technologies.  The students incorporated into this work will be primarily from underrepresented groups in engineering.  These students will be involved in all aspects of the work and data dissemination such that their research experiences will help distribute the underling knowledge of this project.  The data will be directly distributed to consulting and industry groups that already collaborate with the department; many of these private businesses have ?sustainability? teams or strategic initiatives within their companies.  It is possible that they will become interested in this approach from a biofuel recovery perspective, but it is more likely in the short term that they will provide critical insight to the project goals such that the future experiments will reflect the needs of industry."
17838,NSF,NSF,"Shepler and Witherspoon will develop a theory of deformations expanding that for graded Hecke algebras.  They will study deformations of skew group algebras that combine groups of symmetries with algebras of functions.  Particular deformations of these algebras arose independently in work by many prominent mathematicians in representation theory and noncommutative geometry, but many open questions remain.  Shepler and Witherspoon will answer some of these questions using new tools created by blending methods from invariant theory, combinatorics, homological algebra, and representation theory.  They also will solve some basic open problems about the structure and cohomology of Hopf algebras and  prove several conjectures on modular reflection groups, invariant theory, and arrangements of hyperplanes.Objects throughout the natural world reveal themselves through their symmetries, for example, crystals, molecules, DNA, and quantum systems.  When we deform an object, we alter or even break the symmetry.  Remarkably often, we discover new attributes of the object after studying its deformations. Shepler and Witherspoon's research program on graded Hecke algebras and related deformations addresses a variety of mathematical fields and grows from the exploding interest the mathematical community shows in graded Hecke algebras.  Hecke algebras are pervasive throughout mathematics,  appearing in algebra, geometry, number theory, combinatorics, topology, statistics, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, special functions, quantum groups, knot theory, and conformal field theory.

17874,NSF,HHS,"This proposal requests continuing support for a program of research for the Sokoloff/Meadows group at the University of Cincinnati Main Campus in experimental elementary particle physics based primarily on the BaBar experiment at SLAC and  the proposed LSST experiment.The BABAR Collaboration was created in 2004 to design, construct, and operate a detector at an asymmetric B-factory to study the origins of CP-violation in the decays of B mesons.  In addition to many discoveries made related to B meson physics, BABAR has discovered new particles (the DSJ and the Y(4260) as examples) and has discovered new phenomena such as the oscillations (mixing) of particles into anti-particles, and vice versa, in the neutral D meson system.  During the coming grant period, the group will pursue it studies of D0 &#8722; D 0-bar mixing, CP-violation in D meson decays, fundamental properties of D mesons, B meson decays related to measuring the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix angle a, and of decays of the Y(4260).Looking to the future, they have begun working on the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project to study the distribution of dark matter in the universe.  Both the characteristics of dark matter and its distribution within the universe provide important constraints on any theory of the fundamental forces of nature.  Precise measurements of the distribution of dark matter via weak lensing, made in parallel with direct observations of high mass particles produced at the Tevatron and/or the LHC, direct observations of dark matter in the laboratory, and indirect observations of the interactions or decays of dark matter in astrophysics experiments will lead to a fundamental unification of physics at the smallest and largest scales.  Now the Standard Model does not include a candidate for the cold dark matter which is so much more abundant than its baryonic cousin.  Their work on BABAR constrains theories of physics beyond the Standard Model and may help point the way to new physics. Studying the distribution of dark matter in the universe will connect the particle interactions one observes in the laboratory today with those observed in the universe at the earliest times.On Broader Impacts, the group will continue its work primarily within the QuarkNet program as well as employing undergraduates in the research.  In research, they will collaborate closely with astronomers on the LSST.  While they have very, very much to learn from them, they also offer new perspectives and experience that should lead to better conventional astronomy, as well as first-rate cosmology.  They bring experience working in large collaborations, with tremendously large datasets, where reducing and understanding systematic uncertainties is critical to the science. Integrating the techniques of experimental particle physics with those of astronomy promises the greatest reach for answering fundamental scientific questions related to dark matter and dark energy."
17875,NSF,NSF,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY Ionic liquids exhibit many appealing properties, including chemical and thermal stability, vanishing vapor pressure, tunable solvation, high ionic conductivity, and high dielectric constant, that render them appealing as key ingredients in plastic electronics, batteries, fuel cells, gas separation membranes, and actuators. To realize these properties in applications, it is necessary to solidify the material, and/or to confine the ionic liquid within a desired nanostructure. Block copolymers offer unprecedented flexibility to direct self-assembly over lengthscales from 1100 nanometers, while simultaneously providing mechanical integrity. Five different sub-projects will be pursued, that collectively range from very dilute solutions to almost pure polymer, and that are aimed at a fundamental understanding of how polymer/ionic liquid interactions can be utilized to prepare functional materials. Specifically, this research will: (i) extend the concept of the micelle shuttle, whereby copolymer aggregates transfer reversibly and intact between aqueous and ionic liquid phases, to prepare systems that load, transfer, and release cargo at prescribed temperatures, and to prepare nanoemulsions for use in homogenous catalysis; (ii) prepare robust ion gels by tri- and multiblock copolymer self-assembly, whereby gelation and melting occur at tunable temperatures or under optical stimulation; (iii) optimize the use of ion gels as gate dielectric materials in organic transistors, for plastic electronic applications; (iv) create mechanically robust, ordered block copolymer membranes with ionic liquid channels for high ionic conductivity and transport, both isotropic and anisotropic; (v) create supramolecular polymers with relaxation times tunable over a remarkably wide range via hydrogen bonding in ionic liquids.NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARYThe goal of this project is to create a new class of functional nanostructured materials by combining ionic liquids with block copolymers. Materials containing polymers and ionic liquids are potentially useful across a wide spectrum of technology platforms, including plastic electronics, actuators, sensors, batteries, fuel cells, and separation membranes. For applications the simultaneous optimization of several properties, such as high ionic transport, mechanical integrity, and facile processing, is essential; this can be achieved through controlling the material structure at the nanoscale. Ionic liquids are already in commercial practice in Europe as green solvents for chemical transformations; block copolymer surfactants should greatly extend the range of reagents, products, and catalysts that can be employed. Graduate students working in this project will be broadly trained in polymer synthesis and advanced characterization techniques, and will have the opportunity to mentor talented undergraduates in research. High school students from the greater Twin Cities, particularly females and underrepresented minorities, will be exposed to polymer science as part of an  Exploring Careers  summer camp administered with the Institute of Technology Center for Educational Programs. Faculty and students from colleges and universities across the US will spend time in the PI's laboratories to utilize one or more of the experimental facilities, through the newly-forged Materials Research Facilities Network."
17887,NSF,NSF,"The origins of space and time are one of the enduring mysteries of nature. Did space and time emerge in some kind of Big Bang? Will the universe end in a Big Crunch?

String theory remains the best candidate for such a theory. The first aim of this project is to explore the nature of time in string theory through the study of both singular and non-singular time-dependent backgrounds. The second aim is to further explore the physics of flux compactifications with a focus on the heterotic string and the relation between moduli stabilization, the emergence of the Standard Model of Particle Physics and cosmology.

Our primary tools to accomplish the objectives of this project will be the Renormalization Group, which enables the forces between nucleons to be evolved to a softer form that is more convenient for large-scale computations, and Effective Field Theory, which provides a model-independent and systematic organization of inter-nucleon forces.This project will have broader impacts by fostering inter-disciplinary connections and helping to build a strong and youthful scientific community in the United States.  The complementary techniques of Effective Field Theory and the Renormalization Group are widely used in many areas of theoretical physics due to their universality and power of simplification.  Therefore, our use of these modern and general techniques will enhance interactions with other disciplines such as condensed matter, atomic, and high energy theory.  Similarly, the use of coupled-cluster and energy density functional methods for nuclei in this work will foster connections with quantum chemistry.  Finally, the current project will provide graduate students and postdocs with a good balance of formal (analytical) and practical (numerical) work, which will serve as excellent preparation for a career in industry or academia."
17896,NSF,HHS,"CBET-0756166ChapmanMany modern applications of macromolecular fluids take advantage of their novel microstructure and phase behavior. The challenge in modeling nano-structured fluids lies in understanding the new physics that emerges from finite-size effects, varying dimensionality, surface forces and interplay of multiple length and time scales. The introduction of external surface forces and the competition between fluid substrate and fluid-fluid interactions lead to interesting surface driven phase changes not seen in bulk systems [9]. Intellectual Merit: The project focuses on the to development of a novel molecular theory for multi-scale modeling of complex fluid assemblies and to apply the theory to several critical problems in nano-structured media. The work builds on the PIs new density functional theory (DFT) that has shown an unprecedented combination of accuracy and simplicity in predicting the structure of inhomogeneous polyatomic mixtures [29,30]. Predictions of the DFT are in excellent agreement with molecular simulation results for phenomena such as polymer depletion, enhancement and surface induced segregation key elements in polymer-colloid systems and in coatings of polymer blends. Further, the DFT has similar simplicity and computational speed to an atomic density functional theory. We propose to incorporate multiple molecular association sites, chain stiffness, and hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces in the theory. The approach will be validated with molecular simulation results and compared with experiment for interfacial properties and structure of copolymer, surfactant, and tethered polymer systems. Broader Impact: The immense potential of the DFT has led to an ongoing collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) to incorporate our DFT within their massively parallel DFT solver package ? TRAMONTO. With its existing capabilities, TRAMONTO can address life-scale systems such as colloids and electrolytes in a range of 2D/3D geometries. Integrating the PIs polyatomic DFT within this platform dramatically expands the potential scope of the package to such systems as self-assembly in polymer-colloid polymer-nanoparticle systems, block copolymer films and blends, surfactant or lipid systems exhibiting micellar or bilayer structures, and polyelectrolytes. When the final version is released to the public, it is anticipated that these computational tools will have high impact on nanoscience and design of nanosystems by allowing exhaustive analysis of design or phase space (needed for design of experiments) at a moderate expense. Dow Chemical has significant interest in applying the theory to model microstructure and interfacial properties of copolymer solutions, blends, and surfactants. Letters of collaboration from Sandia and Dow are attached with direct and in-kind funding from Dow. Of further impact will be education of a graduate student, post-doc, and undergraduate students participating in the project. These students will make presentations to companies that have participated in our Consortium on Complex Fluids and present research results at international conferences. The graduate student benefited from a summer internship offered by Dow. In addition to incorporating new theory in courses at Rice, the project  will develop an educational module (book chapter) of the theory for web distribution using the internationally recognized Connexions environment (cnx.rice.edu)."
17914,NSF,NSF,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a highly energy efficient, high throughput continuous flow fixed-bed reactor technology for cost-effective algae oil biodiesel production. Algae oil has emerged as one of the most promising sources for mass biodiesel production to replace all transportation fuel in the U.S. A large amount of algae oil will be available in the near future for biodiesel production. However, the current commercial biodiesel production process - a homogeneous catalyst based transesterification process - has not changed much in the last two decades and is far from being efficient. In addition to the significant capital costs required for this homogeneous alkali-catalyzed process, the neutralization and washing processes, along with the production of waste water, are energy and labor intensive and not environmentally friendly. To meet the mass algae oil production demand and achieve the algae biodiesel economy, a new highly energy efficient and high throughput biodiesel production process needs to be developed. In Phase I, research will focus on evaluating the algae oil composition, optimizing the fixed-bed reactor configuration and operating conditions, producing ASTM D6751 standard biodiesel, and proving the technical feasibility. The successful application of this technology to algae oil biodiesel production will significantly increase biodiesel productivity, simplify product separation and purification, improve glycerin quality, eliminate the washing step and associated waste stream, and reduce the plant size and capital costs. This will, in turn, lead to the replacement of the low-efficiency homogeneous catalyst biodiesel production process with a highly efficient fixed-bed heterogeneous catalytic process for algae oil biodiesel production, expedite the substitution of petroleum diesel with domestically produced alternative fuel, decrease energy consumption and its associated environmental impact, reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports, and enable the U.S. transportation industry to sustain a strong, competitive position in domestic and world markets. This technology will be commercialized in our company. Additionally, we will license it to biodiesel producers or plant developers to make it available to the entire biodiesel industry. With collaborations with the largest biodiesel companies in the U.S., this technology will be commercialized within three years."

17964,NSF,HHS,"The landscape is a fundamental component of the human experience. Yet until recently, the study of these larger parts of the human environment has been fragmented among the disciplines and often has been appended to studies of more proximate environments. This award supports a transdisciplinary workshop that will bring together a range of perspectives on how landscape is represented in language, and what this reveals about the relationships of people to the land. Workshop participants will address several key questions. Are there cross-cultural and cross-linguistic variations in the delimitation, classification, and naming of geographic features? What are the similarities across languages, and how great are the differences? Can alternative world-views, as expressed in representations of landforms, be utilized to produce appropriate culturally-specific Geographic Information Systems (GIS)? The workshop will discuss these and related questions and involve about two dozen scholars from a range of disciplines: anthropologists, geographers, information scientists, linguists, philosophers, and others. The workshop will build on the long-term collaboration between the 'Ethnophysiography' research project (David Mark, Andrew Turk and David Stea) and researchers at the Max Planck Institution (MPI) for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen (Netherlands) (Stephen Levinson, Niclas Burenhult, and others), a leading center for research on cross-cultural variations in language and thought. Researchers in the MPI's Language and Cognition Group have recently concluded a set of case studies of landscape terms (and place names) in nine languages in a wide variety of geographic locations. Researchers from those two groups constitute the workshop organizing committee. The remaining invited participants are from other institutions and disciplines, selected to compliment the strengths of the MPI and 'Ethnophysiography' participants. To ensure the presence of 'new blood' and alternative perspectives, the remaining participants will be selected from researchers who respond to an open call for participation. The workshop will combine standard paper presentations and discussion sessions with field experiences. The field trips will provide grounding for the discussions of theory and principles. The majority of the meeting will be held at Chinle, Arizona, on the Navajo Reservation, at the mouth of Canyon de Chelly. The program also will include a half day in Window Rock, capital of the Navajo Nation, where we plan for workshop participants to meet with tribal officials with responsibilities related to GIS or to cultural preservation. At the workshop's other sessions, participants will summarize their recent work and discuss research themes, including: semantics of landscape terms; the role and construction of geographic names (toponyms); topophilia; conceptual frameworks (ontologies); and relations to indigenous mapping and GIS. Discussion sessions will aim to reach consensus on research issues and priorities. These should include, but not be limited to: ontologies for comparing landscape terms and concepts cross-linguistically; factors that may influence the nature of terms and concepts adopted and used by a speech community; relationships of spiritual aspects of culture to landscape terms and toponyms; research methods, especially field methods; and discussion of ethical dimensions of the research, and its potential value to the indigenous communities involved in the research. Outcomes of the workshop will include research priorities for the study of the relationships between language, culture, and landscape. We expect new insights on this important research topic to arise during the workshop and to activate new research programs that will advance knowledge of how people conceptualize and communicate about the landscape. Workshop outcomes also should improve the theoretical basis for computerized Indigenous GIS and mapping systems. The workshop also will contribute to methods for documenting and preserving domain-specific language and culture related to landscape. Broader impact also will result from the participation of early career scholars from several disciplines, and from workshop publications (likely a special issue of a journal).  Diversity will be emphasized in the recruitment of the early-career participants. Holding the majority of the workshop on the Navajo Reservation will contribute to the local economy and provide opportunities for native-American students and others to participate in the workshop."
17968,NSF,NSF,"Travel support will be provided for 8 young researchers from US institutions to attend the 2008 Conference on Stochastic Networks. Priority for support will be given to researchers who have received their PhD within the last five years and to graduate students in the last year of their PhD programs.Stochastic network models have played a fundamental role in the development of modern manufacturing, telecommunications, and computer systems. Interest in these models cuts across many scientific disciplines including operations research, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and statistics. Frequently, important problems are attacked from very different points of view, and there is great benefit to bringing together researchers with a wide variety of perspectives. In order to address these problems, we need new mathematical models and analysis techniques.  The primary goal of the conference is to identify such models and the requisite analytic and computational methodologies that will help in basic understanding of system behavior and in the design and control of these networks.

18016,NSF,NSF,"IIS - 0752768   SGER: New Representations of Musical SoundBocko, Mark F.University of RochesterThis SGER project proposes a new representation for encoding musical performances capable of capturing expressive and syntactic components of the performance and extending the ability to manipulate, analyze musical digital information. By focusing on the twin themes of music representation and recognition, new fundamental concepts will be developed that will enable the development of new tools to acquire, organize, and interpret musical knowledge. The project team has backgrounds in music theory and performance, engineering, signal processing, and physics and will conduct a number of interrelated projects that contribute to the main goal of developing a new musical language. Performance techniques of master musicians (performance professors at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music) will be recorded and studied with the goal of identifying the parametric representations that most accurately and compactly depict the music.  From these a more robust representation of musical sounds and performance descriptors will be developed."
18065,NSF,NSF,"Complex communication for co-located performers within telepresence applications across networks is still impaired compared performers sharing one physical location. This impairment must be significantly reduced to allow the broader community to participate in complex communication scenarios.  To achieve this goal, an avatar in the form of a musical conductor with forms of artificial intelligence will coordinate between co-located musicians. Improvised Contemporary Live Music of a larger ensemble, serving as a test bed, is arguably one of the most complex scenarios one could think of, because it requires  engaged communication between individuals within a multiple-source sound field that also has to be considered as a whole.  The results are expected to inspire solutions for other communication tasks.  The avatar system will actively coordinate co-located improvisation ensembles in a creative way. To achieve this goal, Computational Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA) systems, to allow robust feature recognition, and Evolutionary algorithms, for the creative component, will be combined, to  form the first model of its kind. The research results are expected to be significant by themselves and are not bound to telematic applications. With regard to the latter, the proposed system will have a clear  advantage over a human musician/conductor, while intelligent algorithms are clearly lacking behind human performance in most other applications, especially when it comes to creativity."
18085,NSF,HHS,"The major goal of this research is to improve understanding of the processes that lead to structure and intensity changes of tropical cyclones (TC). The working hypotheses are (1) any environmental flow introduces quasi-stationary asymmetric forcing which reduce the capability of axisymmetrization potential of the symmetric circulation, and thus limiting the maximum potential intensity that the TC otherwise can achieve given favorable tropical oceanic conditions, and (2) external forcing affects tropical cyclone structure and intensity changes either directly or indirectly through the mesoscale processes occurring in the inner core region (within about 200 km from the cyclone center), including interactions among inner, outer spiral rainbands and eyewall convection; concentric eyewall cycle; and eyewall breakdown and the associated mixing process. The following scientific questions will be addressed: a. How do the inner and outer spiral rainbands form, propagate, and interact with each other and with eyewall convection, affecting tropical cyclone structure and intensity changes? b. How important is the environmental asymmetric forcing to the formation of tropical cyclone concentric eyewall and the subsequent eyewall replacement? What determines the timing and lifetime of the concentric eyewall cycle and the associated tropical cyclone intensity change? c. How does the inner core of a tropical cyclone respond to vertical shear of the environmental flow and what are the subsequent changes in storm structure and intensity? How sensitive are the structure and intensity changes to both the magnitude and vertical profile of the shear? To answer these questions, the Principal Investigator (PI) will use the quadruply nested, movable mesh, fully compressible, nonhydrostatic tropical cyclone model (TCM4) developed by the PI to conduct a series of well-designed idealized numerical experiments. The PI will analyze satellite and radar data for tropical cyclones over both the western North Pacific and Atlantic and the global reanalysis products to help design the idealized model initial conditions. Comprehensive diagnostics and budget analyses of the numerical results will be performed to elucidate the physical mechanisms. The intellectual merit of the project: This research will further understanding of the roles of inner core dynamics and their interaction with the large-scale environment in leading to the structure and intensity changes of tropical cyclones, in particular, their contributions to the formation of concentric eyewall structure and the size changes of the eye, eyewall, and the storm scale circulation. The broader impacts of the project: Research on tropical cyclone structure and intensity changes is of high priority within the U.S. Weather Research Program (USWRP), an interagency activity designed to perform research necessary to improve understanding and prediction of tropical cyclone motion, structure, and intensity. This research potentially will contribute to improved understanding of the physical processes that cause the tropical cyclone structure and intensity changes, leading to improved prediction of tropical cyclone structure and intensity by numerical models. In the process of carrying out this research, the PI will train a graduate student in the science of tropical cyclones, especially in the area of tropical cyclone modeling and numerical prediction."
18155,NSF,NSF,"Denitrification to nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N2) is one of the most poorly understood portions of the land-based nitrogen (N) cycle. This microbial process can release N to the atmosphere as N2O, a potent greenhouse gas and a catalyst for stratospheric ozone depletion, or N2, an inert gas.  This dissertation research focuses on understanding the controls on denitrification to N2 and N2O in tropical forest soils, one of the largest natural sources of N2O globally. In preliminary experiments, evidence of N2 production from anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) was detected, as was evidence of iron reduction coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation and denitrification. The presence of these new pathways is likely to change the general understanding of ecosystem-scale N cycling. This research will determine the significance of these new N2 production pathways in upland soils. This will be achieved with laboratory experiments employing 15-N tracer methods similar to those successfully used to show the importance of anammox in marine environments. This project will include several science outreach activities in the local community and on the UC-Berkeley campus.  These include active contributions to Techbridge Girls, a local program introducing girls to careers in technology, science and engineering, and Community Resources for Science, which helps elementary school teachers use scientific resources for hands-on classroom activities. At UC-Berkeley, project personnel will participate in the Undergraduate Graduate Mentorship Program. Research results will be disseminated at national scientific conferences and incorporated into Ecosystem Ecology lectures on N cycling at UC-Berkeley."

18205,NSF,NSF,"This proposal covers many interrelated topics aiming to answer truly fundamental questions in theoretical physics. Among them: what is the correct gravity theory at large (cosmic) distances? What is quantum gravity? What is its energy scale? How (in)distinguishable are black holes? What is the origin of and solution to the hierarchy problem? The group consists of four theorists who work both separately and together on these fundamental questions. Porrati intends to undertake a systematic study of general theorems on interacting high-spin particles, both massive and massless. He proposes to extend previous results on back-reaction effects of gravity to understand their effects at short and large distances. He will work with G. Dvali and G. Gabadadze to understand the dynamics of IR modified gravity as well as of standard General Relativity. Porrati will use his expertise in string theory, and his past work on the AdS/CFT duality to study simpler,potentially soluble models of quantum gravity in lower dimension.Gabadadze is planning to approach the cosmological constant problem, and the issue of cosmic acceleration within the paradigm of large distance modification of gravity. He will: search for brane induced gravity models that lead to an accelerated expansion. Sirlin plans to continue his studies of several aspects of precision electroweak physics and related concepts in Quantum Field Theory, and to pursue the search of signals and bounds for new physics beyond the Standard Model.  Dvali's research will focus on identifying and studying the new physics beyond the Standard Model, both in cosmology and particle physics. He is interested in how the dynamics behind the mechanism of stabilizing the weak scale will have consequences for LHC physics (such as, for example, production of mini black holes). He is also interested in theories of gravity that provide new physics at long distances, that on the one hand could explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and on the other can have testable experimental consequences.The PIs are involved in working with the NYU School of education on various outreach projects. They also give popular lectures, serve as liaisons with Latin-American students and write popular science articles."
18206,NSF,HHS,"The long-term objective of the Principal Investigator's research program is to elucidate the mechanisms of somatic chromatin biosynthesis, and to understand the transfer of epigenetic information to progeny cells. To this end, the project focuses on posttranslational modifications of newly synthesized histones (histones are the major chromosomal proteins), and the mode(s) of H3/H4 tetramer assembly in human cells. The manner in which H3/H4 tetramers are assembled in vivo will be examined by immunoprecipitating mononucleosomes containing radiolabeled, epitope-tagged H4 and H3 variants in synchronized cells. Experiments will also be performed to determine the complete acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation states of newly synthesized human histones H4 and H3 variants as a function of the cell cycle. This will be accomplished by purifying nascent H3/H4 predeposition complexes during G1 and S phases. Newly synthesized histones will analyzed by tandem (MS/MS) mass spectrometry, to uncover all of the modifications of human H3 and H4 prior to deposition onto DNA.  The project will provide essential information on the manner in which nucleosomes (the fundamental subunits of eukaryotic chromosomes) are assembled, onto both replicating and non-replicating DNA. The research will have a broader societal impact in three major areas: (1) It will provide excellent research experience for undergraduates, thereby fostering their scientific development; (2) it  will offer research opportunities for high school students, through participation in the Research Science Institute; and (3) cell lines developed in the course of the project will be made available to other researchers in the field, thus helping to stimulate further research at other national institutions."
18208,NSF,HHS,"This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop HunchLab -- software tools that leverage spatial statistics to enable police personnel to test their theories of criminality against data collected in the day-to-day activities of policing. The preceding Phase I project proved the feasibility of developing HunchLab as a set of innovative software tools that scour the historic data of a police department, search for geographic aberrations expected by the theories or 'hunches' put forth by crime analysts, and apply spatial statistics to confirm or deny the supposition. Preventing crime is a more sophisticated task than simply mapping incidents or arrests and deploying resources accordingly. The ability to detect and analyze changes in the geographic patterns of crime and disorder is an innovation in policing which holds the potential to enhance the organizational capacity of police departments across the country. This Phase II project will refine the application and build additional functionality, including alternate workflows for different user types, expanding the alert infrastructure, and building text mining capabilities.The obvious sector that this product will impact is law enforcement at all levels of government. Additionally the successful outcome will impact federal law enforcement agencies and regional crime analysis consortia. There are roughly 250 municipalities with over 100,000 people in them, and these each have police departments that would find this system of use. The tools will be helping thousands of police officers do their jobs better every day. This efficiency will result in better policing, meaning that criminals will be caught more effectively. Criminals cause damage far in excess of the property and medical costs directly attributable to their activity. Perhaps more importantly, the research will form the basis for other products that operate in realms other than law enforcement. The algorithms and technologies developed in the Phase I prototype are transferable to other datasets that demonstrate similar point pattern processes - events with explicit spatial and temporal attributes. Our Phase I process demonstrated a substantial utility in domains other than law enforcement including fraud detection, real estate, sales and public health. The Phase II work plan includes testing with other data sets to refine that software should address these other markets."
18243,NSF,NSF,"Catalytic ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) are at the core of several fundamental cellular processes, including protein synthesis, tRNA processing, and RNA splicing. The contributions of the RNA and protein components are varied. In some instances, RNA subunits harbor catalytic activity and the proteins enhance the formation or stability of the active RNA structure. In others, RNAs provide an assembly scaffold for catalytically-active proteins.  RNA and protein molecules are known to cooperate in forming substrate binding surfaces and, in principle, they could cooperate to form an active site. This project uses RNPs harboring  self-splicing  group II introns to explore modes of cooperation between RNA and protein. The chemical mechanism of group II intron splicing is identical to that in the spliceosome and it is speculated that these two splicing machineries evolved from a common ancestor. Nine nucleus-encoded proteins that are required for the splicing of various subsets of the 17 group II introns in maize chloroplasts were identified previously. These proteins provide unique tools for exploring how proteins and RNAs cooperate during RNP assembly and catalysis. Experiments will focus on the subset of intron RNPs containing a protein called CRS2. CRS2 is derived from a bacterial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (PTH) and functions in heterodimeric complexes with either of two closely-related proteins, CAF1 or CAF2. Recent data suggest that CRS2/CAF complexes interact intimately with the intron catalytic core in a manner that differs from interactions in previously-studied group II intron RNPs. Structural and phylogenetic data suggest the intriguing possibility that the region of CRS2 derived from the PTH active site may contribute to splicing catalysis; this notion is bolstered by recent biochemical studies of intron RNP architecture, which place the CRS2 active site region near the branchpoint adenosine that initiates splicing. Experiments will take advantage of established protein expression systems and biochemical assays to further dissect the architecture of CRS2/CAF/intron RNPs, to test whether CRS2/CAF binding organizes RNA elements at the catalytic core, and to test whether CRS2 contributes directly to catalysis. The results obtained could impact our understanding of RNA-protein cooperation in the spliceosome, ribosome, and other catalytic RNPs. The most ancient and universal components of the machinery for expressing genetic information consist of large complexes between RNA and protein, macromolecules with distinct biochemical and structural features. The contributions of the RNA and protein moieties have become intertwined during a long period of co-evolution, and understanding of the repertoire of possible modes of cooperation between these molecules is incomplete. This project uses catalytic RNA-protein particles called group II intron RNPs to explore this issue. Prior results suggest that the proteins in these particles play a distinct and more fundamental role than has previously been documented for proteins in catalytic RNPs. Thus, the results obtained could impact our under-standing of RNA-protein cooperation in other macromolecular complexes underlying gene expression. High school, undergraduate and graduate students, including minority/underprivileged students, will be educated through their involvement in this project."
18264,NSF,NSF,"Engineering - Civil (54)Nearly all civil engineering structures are supported by either soil or rock and design engineers rely significantly on the soil and rock properties determined through field tests and laboratory tests to ensure structural integrity.

This project is developing digital videos designed to improve student understanding of experiments commonly performed in geotechnical engineering and to help prepare students for professional practice as civil engineers. The content of the digital videos being developed includes instructions on how common laboratory experiments are performed as well as a demonstration of how these experiments are linked to real-life engineering projects in the field.

18265,NSF,HHS,"Understanding patterns of both large (plate) scale mantle flow and smaller scale buoyant flow in subduction zones is key to models of subduction zone thermal structure, dehydration reactions and volatile distribution, and magma generation and transport. Different patterns of flow in the mantle wedge can generate distinct signatures in seismological and geochemical observables, and ample evidence indicates that a simple two-dimensional, plate-driven corner flow model is inadequate in a significant number of regions. For example, observed shear-wave fast polarization directions in several subduction zones are inconsistent with predictions based on two-dimensional wedge corner flow even when taking into account possible deviations from the standard A-type olivine slip system (e.g. the Marianas, Central America, Tonga, South America, Kamchatka, Alaska). In addition, some arcs and back-arcs contain lavas that exhibit characteristics very similar to nearby hot spot volcanics (e.g. northern Tonga, Costa Rica- Nicaragua), suggesting mantle is entrained into the wedge along highly three-dimensional (3-D) (non-corner flow) trajectories. The combination of recent observations and 3-D modeling suggests subduction-induced wedge circulation has more spatial and temporal complexity than predicted in previous two-dimensional (2-D) modeling. We propose two sets of laboratory experiments to model 3-D subduction zone flow and anisotropy which build upon the PI's previous efforts and which are strongly constrained by seismic data. One set of experiments will investigate how mantle flow is driven by a variety of physical subduction zone parameters related to plate motions and the subducting slab (alongstrike slab dip variations, trench roll-back, slab edges and tears, and upper plate morphology and deformation). In a second set of experiments, The second will consider how wedge material with anomalous viscosity and/or buoyancy interacts with flow and alters predicted anisotropy; sources of such material include hydrated or partially melted mantle from the slab-wedge interface, volatile depleted mantle produced by decompression melting or enriched mantle entrained into the wedge. In both sets of experiments, parameters will be systemically varied to quantify the relative impact of different factors. Flow models will be tested through comparison with seismic anisotropy observed in subduction zones around the globe; this involves transformation of flow fields to crystallographic orientations, and calculation of shearwave splitting. Model development and data-model comparisons will focus on two regions: Nicaragua-Costa Rica and the Marianas. These systems have key differences in plate motions, slab geometry and age, and upper plate deformation, and both are well-sampled by shear-wave splitting, as well as other seismic and geochemical studies.Intellectual merit. This proposal will contribute to an understanding of the physical processes that drive 3D mantle wedge flow and will provide a better context for interpreting the growing number of data sets in subduction systems. Specific questions to be addressed include: 1) What effect does spatial complexity in along-arc slab morphology and sinking mode have on flow in the wedge? 2) Can combinations of these parameters and upper plate shape and deformation produce 3D flows that are consistent with observed anisotropy (e.g., arc-parallel fast directions)? 3) How do altered or chemically distinct regions of mantle wedge interact with 3- D, subduction-induced flow? 4) Does the long-term deformation and entrainment of these features produce LPO patterns that are consistent with observations? 5) How do these patterns change with density/viscosity contrasts between ambient and altered mantle reservoirs and what are the implications for geochemical models of arc magmagenesis?Broader impacts. The proposed work would help to constrain mantle flow and its implications for melting processes in the Nicaragua-Costa Rica and Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction zones, the two MARGINS Subduction Factory focus areas. This project would provide a Brown graduate student and a URI graduate student with training in laboratory fluids experiments, their integration with seismic observables, and their interpretation. The URI fluids lab will be used as a teaching tool in URI and Brown courses."
18269,NSF,HHS,"Project SummaryThe global economy is characterized by increasing locational competition to attract the resources necessary to develop leading-edge technologies as drivers of regional and national growth. One means of facilitating such growth and improving national competitiveness is to improve the operation of the national innovation system. This involves national technology development and innovation programs designed to support research on new technologies, enhance the commercial return on national research, and facilitate the production of globally competitive products. The Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP) is studying selected foreign innovation programs and comparing them with major U.S. programs. The analysis includes a review of the goals, concept, structure, operation, funding levels, and evaluation of foreign programs similar to major U.S. programs, e.g., innovation awards, S&T parks, and consortia. Statement of Objectives As part of this review of Comparative Innovation Policy, the STEP Board is convening a symposium on  Understanding Research Science & Technology Parks: Global Best Practice.  The conference will bring together leading figures from governments, universities, and science and technology parks, both from the United States and around the world. The goal of the conference is to increase policy makers' understanding of the role of S&T parks as sources of innovation and regional growth, while also reviewing their contributions to government missions and to the commercialization of university research. An important characteristic of S&T parks is their diversity. Accordingly, the conference will examine a broad range of S&T parks, including both university- and laboratory-based parks as well as the large-scale industrial models often undertaken in Asia and Europe. While recognizing the diversity of objectives and the differences in scope and scale of activity, the conference will seek to identify common challenges faced by S&T parks both in the U.S. and abroad, including evaluation and the need for appropriate metrics. Broader Impacts The Committee is assessing foreign programs using a standard template, convening a series of meetings to gather data from responsible officials and program managers, and encouraging a systematic dissemination of information and analysis as a means of better understanding the transition of university and laboratory research into commercial products with the goal of improving the operation of U.S. programs. In addition to generating greater awareness of foreign policies and programs, especially among Members of Congress and their staff, the study will produce an overview report that includes findings and recommendations addressing the issues outlined above at the conclusion of the overall study. These findings and recommendations will then be widely disseminated."

A principal motivation for the VOCALS project is that global model errors in this region degrade the quality of their simulations throughout the tropical Pacific, with substantial impacts on the modeled and predicted global climate. It is difficult or impossible to address these errors directly in global models with currently available computational resources, because the mechanisms that determine the mean state and variability have much finer spatial scales than global models can resolve. Moreover, these mechanisms do not lend themselves to unique and physically constrained treatments. A further complication is that the mechanisms involve interactions among all major components of the Earth system, including physical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface, as well as natural and anthropogenic influences on marine and atmospheric chemistry. Simulating these interlocking processes requires high resolution (several kilometers) with coupled atmosphere, ocean, and land components in both physical and chemical submodels.In this project a regional Earth-system modeling framework will be developed, with an atmospheric model coupled to a land surface model and an oceanic model. The atmospheric model includes chemical transport and process models, while the regional oceanic model contains full biogeochemistry. This framework will be used to explicate the climate dynamics of the VOCALS region and to leverage VOCAL REx (Regional Experiment) measurements through careful experimental design and model-validation and data-interpretation studies.First, meteorological and aerosol forecasts will be provided for VOCALS REx during the campaign. After VOCALS REx, a retrospective simulation of the VOCAL REx period will be carried out using the full Earth-system model. The simulation's high resolution is intended to increase the interpretability of measurements by placing them in geographical and climate-variability context and to enhance the usefulness of measurements for model validation and evaluation. A simulation of the VOCALS region covering the past 60 years will place the VOCALS-REx observations and simulations in the context of climate variability. Finally, the VOCALS region will be downscaled from an NCAR CCSM (National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model) global solution, placing the realism gained through careful development and VOCALS-REx-based validation of the regional model in the context of the errors in a major global climate model. All these simulations will be performed on the same model grid to allow for systematic comparison of model solutions with observations and with each other. The simulations will provide opportunities for analyses of interlocking physical and chemical processes that determine the climate of the VOCALS region. These include studies of the geographical distribution of natural and anthropogenic aerosols; the impact of these aerosols on cloud properties and the effects of clouds on aerosol scavenging; the intricate and highly-structured couplings in the physical system determining key climate variables such as stratus amount and upwelling; and the oceanographic processes controlling air-sea fluxes of DMS (dimethyl sulfide).Broader impacts of this project are in its contributions to building human infrastructure for science research. Through interactions with colleagues in Peru and Chile, the investigators will foster international scientific collaboration, and they will train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The project will leave a legacy of modeling infrastructure, as the first time a holistic regional Earth-systems approach has been applied so systematically to any region. The modeling framework to be developed can serve as a prototype for Earth-system modeling in the service of climate prediction and climate applications. Finally, the PIs propose to capitalize on the unique measurements to be taken during the VOCALS-REx field campaign to understand the interlocking physical and chemical dynamics of the VOCALS region and to diagnose the causes of large, persistent errors in global models errors, potentially paving the way for improvements in climate predictions."
18277,NSF,HHS,"American mesmerism affords an opportunity to study science and society during a seminal period in the building of the nation. Bursting into American consciousness in the mid-nineteenth century, mesmerism simultaneously penetrated religious, scientific, medical and burgeoning popular cultural spheres of activity. The controversial practice, with its electro-magnetic nerve forces and inexplicable trances, incited feelings of awe, consternation, and creativity in people who came in contact with it. What on earth was this inexplicable mesmeric trance? A new scientific discovery? A religious revelation? A remarkable cure-all? A hoax? Most Americans encountered mesmerism in public lectures where they experienced a beguiling fusion of scientific investigation of the mind, community theater, and public medical clinic. On those lecture stages enduring tensions activating American life played out: sacred and secular, belief and skepticism, and imagination and rationalism. Studying mesmerism opens a portal to conflicts that shaped and continue to shape American culture.A prime objective of this Science & Society Professional Development Fellowship (PDF) is to examine the discourse mesmerism provoked to understand how this demonstration of  public science  was used to construct knowledge. A second objective is to examine how mesmerism contributed to nineteenth-century psychology. The core of mesmeric practice (inducing a person into trance altered thinking, feeling, and bodily functions) is the seminal  experimental  event from whence discoveries and applications emanated. Dynamic mind-body phenomena that could be manipulated for scientific inquiry, potent  mind-powers  for self-enhancement and healing, and intense feelings of  sympathy  that passed between the mesmerist and the entranced were incorporated into an intriguing view of human nature that  seeded  several nineteenth-century therapies (such as hypnosis) and three religious sects. How mesmerism impacted the development of American psychology is not well understood.PDF funding will support research and training for the PI during a 2008-9 academic sabbatical. Project methodology is historical research, critical analysis of period texts, papers, and periodicals, and historiographies in the history of science. The training component will take place at the University of Minnesota's History of Science, Technology and Medicine (HSTM) program. Coursework will address research methods and historiography in the history of science. Consultations with faculty (especially faculty sponsor Sally Gregory Kohlstedt) will guide the PI's research. Products of this PDF are three presentations at history of science/history of social science conferences and three chapters toward a book on American mesmerism (to be completed by 2010). Knowledge and skills acquired by the PI will be used to improve instruction in the history of psychology and the history of science for students at the College of St. Catherine. Proposed research will advance understanding of a view of human nature held by previous generations of Americans that broadly impacted the nineteenth century. It will elucidate mesmerism's public expression, explore its role in the construction of scientific knowledge in its era, and advance understanding of the psychological mind-body practices and theories of social dynamics that were derived from it. With this training and sabbatical support, the PI will be able to research and write the history of American mesmerism in a much more accurate, historiographically sophisticated way and contribute substantially to the history of psychology. Scholarship, dissemination, and teaching in the history of psychology and history of science will remain a central goal for the PI long after the conclusion of the fellowship."
18278,NSF,HHS,"Seismic anisotropy (i.e. seismic waves travel in different directions at different speed) in the deeper earth was discovered in the mid-sixties and was soon interpreted in a qualitative way as a result of crystal alignment during convection. This concept became generally accepted. More recently strong anisotropy and heterogeneity was documented in the lowermost mantle adjacent to the metallic and liquid core. This enigmatic D? zone is both a thermal and chemical boundary layer which is the site of complex dynamic processes that are reflected in many intriguing seismic observations. The cause for seismic anisotropy at the base of the mantle has been the source of much speculation, but its dominant cause is still not known.  Inspired by analogy with dynamic processes that are known to occur in the upper mantle, it is tempting and natural to explain it by invoking deformation processes associated with the direction of flow as lithospheric slabs reach the bottom of the mantle and minerals are subject of phase transformations with increasing pressure. The predominant observation of faster velocities for horizontally polarized shear waves than for vertically polarized ones (Vsh>Vsv) in D? suggests that minerals deform and reorient. In order to gain a better understanding of the origin of seismic anisotropy in D? tools and observations that have so far been developed independently by seismologists, and mineral physicists working with geodynamicists, should be combined.Specifically, this research will rely on five modelling ingredients: 1) Knowledge of microscopic deformation mechanisms of minerals at lower mantle conditions (specifically perovskite, postperovskite and magnesiowuestite), 2) single crystal elastic properties of the constituents at pressure and temperature; 3) plausible large scale dynamics models providing the macroscopic strain field in the lower and lowermost mantle; 4) polycrystal plasticity that predicts reorientation of crystals in a macroscopic deformation field; 5) from 1-2-3-4, a model of elastic anisotropy and its 3D variations can be constructed and,  given an appropriate wave propagation code, synthetic seismograms can be computed for appropriate seismic phases and compared to actual observations. There are now precise ways to compute synthetic seismograms in a 3D anisotropic earth down to body wave frequencies.In order to obtain new insights into our understanding of deformation behavior at the base of Earth?s mantle, we rely on the different expertise in seismology and mineral physics of the two principal investigators. The research will provide suggestions for future seismic experiments targeted at better characterizing anisotropy in D? and the methodologies that are developed will become available to other researchers in the future."
18316,NSF,NSF,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a novel processing technique to form silicon carbide (SiC) boules for wafer production. The technique uses high-purity gas precursors and has the potential to economically produce large diameter SiC boules with low contamination levels and reduced defect levels. In this project, SiC boule growth using gas-phase precursors will be developed for commercialization of 150 mm SiC wafers. SiC is a wide bandgap compound semiconductor with high thermal conductivity, high breakdown electric field strength, thermal stability and chemical inertness. SiC-based electronics are of great interest because they can significantly outperform conventional semiconductors under high-temperature, high-power, high-radiation, and corrosive conditions. Potential products based on SiC include engine control eletronics, turbine engine sensors, power switching devices, microwave electronics, and many others."
18389,NSF,HHS,"The Fields Institute is an international center for mathematical research affiliated with the University of Toronto.  Since 1992, a major part of the Institute's activity has focused on semester- and year-long programs designed to bring the world's leading mathematical researchers from a particular area together with students, postdoctoral fellows, and young academics.In July--December, 2008, the Fields Institute will hold a program entitled  Arithmetic Geometry, Hyperbolic Geometry, and Related Topics.   This will be the Institute's principal activity during that period.Arithmetic geometry is the application of methods of algebraic geometry to questions of relevance to number theory.  Specifically, given a system of equations for which one wants to study its rational solutions (or solutions over a given number field), one studies this system using methods of algebraic geometry and attempts to show finiteness or sparseness of the set of solutions.  The focus of this program is to do so using ideas stemming from the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem in diophantine approximation.Hyperbolic geometry (as envisioned by this program) is the study of analytic functions from the complex plane to complex algebraic manifolds, again studied through the lens of algebraic geometry.  If there are no such functions (other than constant functions), then the manifold is said to be hyperbolic.  A weaker condition would be to show that such maps have sparse image.  The main methods used in this program stem from the work of R. Nevanlinna in value distribution theory.Although the above two paragraphs describe very different areas of mathematics, their statements and methods have been found to be very similar, for reasons that are not fully understood.  In addition, the program will also encompass Arakelov theory, an area of algebraic geometry that is of particular use in arithmetic geometry, and which relies heavily on tools of hyperbolic geometry.This grant will be used to bring US mathematicians to this program and its two workshops, and support them while there.  The funds will be used principally to support young mathematicians who do not have other sources of support, but may also help cover travel expenses of some senior participants.  Since the basic program is primarily funded through Canadian sources, the impact of NSF funding will be highly leveraged, allowing junior and underfunded US researchers to access the program at the relatively small cost of their own travel and subsistence."

Cook to rescue an orphaned mammal collection from the Illinois Museum of Natural History and redistribute it to three other institutional collections, where the specimens can be housed safely and used in research and education.  Approximately 47,000 specimens of mammal skins and skeletons will be re-housed.  These specimens were collected over the past century from a wide variety of locations in the United States, Mexico, and the Philippines.  Notable portions of the collection include Arizona specimens used in a monograph on mammals from that state, specimens of the endangered Mexican Grey Wolf, and collections from many sites that have been changed by human development or subject to climate change.  Such specimens provide physical record of the distribution of mammals in this country and provide important data for land managers and environmental studies. Specimens will go to the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico, the Monte L. Bean Museum at Brigham Young University in Utah, and the Field Museum of Natural History in Illinois, where they will be integrated into other mammal collections where the new specimens will add to the regional strengths of the institutions.  Storage conditions will be improved, and the data associated with the specimens will be captured for an online database that will be accessible to a worldwide community of researchers and educators.  Many students will be recruited for the project, and this will provide material for undergraduate and graduate student research."

Experiments with solar neutrinos gave the first evidence for neutrino mass and mixing. The Borexino experiment has recently made the first real-time measurement of the flux of low energy solar neutrinos from 7Be. The result is consistent with predictions of Standard Solar Models and neutrino oscillations. The group plans to address the full utilization of the calibration system, participation in data acquisition and analysis, and the implications of anticipated Borexino results. With better purity and calibration now achieved, the potential for measuring the CNO and pep solar neutrino fluxes in Borexino is now realistic. The broader impact on science, technology and outreach that is expected from the program includes deployment and utilization of ultra-clean calibration techniques and creating the possibility that, for the first time, one might directly measure the Sun?s energy generation today, versus what is currently seen in the photosphere after a delay of about 50,000 years. The outreach is to astrophysicists, cosmologists, geophysicists and geochemists, chemists and chemical engineers, teachers and students in universities in Virginia and neighboring states and the international scientific community."

18568,NSF,HHS,"Mass evacuation of urban areas due to hurricanes is a critical problem that requires extensive basic and applied research.  Previous research used a microsimulation approach to simulate individual vehicle and driver behavior but was limited mostly to simulation in a small study area.  Very few studies have considered the use of vulnerabilities in the evacuation strategies.  There is a need to develop a better approach to integrate the various information (such as vulnerabilities) to better simulate evacuation so that we can evacuate people timely and efficiently.  This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement project will develop an integrated microsimulation model to simulate hurricane evacuation in New Orleans.  The first objective of this project will be to create a two-level regional disaster evacuation model by integrating two agent-based microsimulation models.  The first model will treat each vehicle as an agent to simulate regional road network traffic movements on highways, while the second model will use each census block centroid as an agent to simulate the local part of the regional road network traffic.  The second project objective will be to evaluate the effectiveness in terms of overall evacuation time and other metrics of three different regional evacuation strategies, including simultaneous evacuation strategy, a staged evacuation strategy based on different community-evacuation vulnerabilities over the study area, and a staged evacuation strategy based on different social-biophysical vulnerabilities.This research project will contribute to the fields of dynamic spatial modeling, visualization, and disaster and vulnerability science.  The incorporation of vulnerabilities into two types of agent-based models will provide more realistic and accurate pictures of how evacuation behavior affects the effectiveness of different evacuation strategies, thus providing useful guidance to policy makers.  Although the proposed integrated agent-based model will be based on hurricane evacuation in New Orleans, the methods developed and the knowledge gained from this research will be applicable for other regions and other kinds of disasters.  Furthermore, the computer modules developed in this research will be widely distributed to benefit other agent-based traffic microsimulation models.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

18632,NSF,NSF,"The Cold Dark Matter paradigm for the universe predicts that galaxy dark matter halos should contain thousands of bound subhalos left over from the hierarchical galaxy formation process. Strong gravitational lensing provides the only direct test of this prediction in galaxies outside the Local Group.  Dr. Charles Keeton (Rutgers University) will work to open a new frontier in substructure studies with gravitational lens time delays. Time delays offer a number of advantages. The theory of time delays and substructure is rich and tractable, providing a rigorous foundation and revealing how to observe and analyze lenses to best probe substructure. Time delays provide access not only to the total amount of substructure, but also to the distribution of subhalo masses.In conjunction with this work, Dr. Keeton will implement a program to integrate scientific critical thinking into undergraduate education by creating a vibrant astrophysics learning community comprising four elements. First, he will create a special topics seminar to introduce freshmen to research in astrophysics. Second, he will create a new course for sophomores to learn how to read, critique, and compose scientific arguments in different styles of scientific communication. Third, he will create a student-led astrophysics reading group for students to continue honing their critical thinking skills. The reading group will create  science reader's guides  for dissemination, and will host a visiting research lecture each semester aimed at undergraduates.  Fourth, Dr. Keeton  will use these activities to guide students into research projects, including his own research group. Though the focus is astrophysics, all elements, except the research project, will appeal to students from all areas of science and engineering. The community will be vertically integrated so that beginning students may interact with and learn from more experienced students, and then later take their turn as peer mentors. Dr. Keeton will use established assessment tools to evaluate and adjust his pedagogical methods in these various interactive learning environments.  He will also disseminate his new pedagogical methods for use by other instructors."
18638,NSF,NSF,"This project addresses fundamental questions at the intersection of several complex variables and partial differential equations. Two thrusts concern global regularity and compactness of the d-bar-Neumann operator in a domain. The principal investigator has recently developed a theory that unifies the known positive results concerning global regularity that is expected to provide an important step towards a desired characterization of this property in terms of properties of the boundary of the domain. It is not known how far the known potential theoretic sufficient conditions for compactness of the d-bar-Neumann operator are from being necessary. Building on his recent work with a graduate student (S. Munasinghe) that provides a different approach, the investigator will seek to characterize compactness. A third thrust of the project initiates a new direction of research: the available evidence suggests that regularity properties of the d-bar-Neumann operator in a domain should have positive implications for the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis of the closure of the domain. The fourth thrust results from a collaboration of the investigator with the postdoctoral researcher A. Raich, in which he and the principal investigator showed that the classical sufficient conditions for compactness of the operators in the interior of a domain (with a necessary modification) also yield compactness of the operators on the boundary. The goal is to combine their methods with earlier methods of the investigator to show that finite type implies subellipticity on the boundary.The study of analysis in several complex variables is motivated both by the centrality of the subject to mathematics and by its usefulness. For example, one of the central laws of nature, causality, when transcribed via a mathematical device called the Fourier transform, leads immediately to analytic functions of several (in this case four) complex variables. Partial differential equations, on the other hand, arise in all areas of science that deal with systems that change over time: physics, engineering, economics, biology, meteorology, environmental sciences, and others. This project is thus located on the basic research end at the intersection of two areas of mathematics that are central to the scientific and technological enterprise. It will impact human resources development directly through funding for graduate students and through the investigator's supervision of postdoctoral researchers, and indirectly through the investigator's organization of and participation in workshops/conferences and through his expository writing."
18646,NSF,HHS,"Modern private and public organizations are enormously dependent on information technology (IT) platforms for all sorts of processes, mission-critical information, communications and continuity. At the same time, threats to IT reliability are constantly increasing due to complexity, human error, hardware and software failure, and malicious attacks.  This study draws upon organizational theories about routine-based behavior and collective ?mindfulness? (i.e., collective vigilence and awareness of detail) from the organizational sciences to develop and test a model relating failure types and various aspects of mindfulness to successful and unsuccessful responses to failures.  We characterize failures on two dimensions: the type of breakdown and extent of prior experience with the context in which the problem occurred.  We hypothesize that organizational response to a failure is contingent on the various types of mindfulness exhibited by the organization.  In addition, we extend the concept of collective mindfulness, which has previously been examined primarily in organizational settings, to inter-organizational settings.  We are able to test the proposed model through a field study of failure ?incidents? experienced by the customers of a leading software and services vendor.  An enhanced understanding of the aspects of mindfulness that yield improved failure response will have practical implications for improving hiring, training, retention, vendor alliances, structure/governance and culture/climate practices so as to achieve greater IT reliability."
18650,NSF,HHS,"Dr. Jeremiah Murphy is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Washington. Dr. Murphy will complete development of BETHE, a multi-angle, multi-energy-group, multidimensional, time-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics code. Radiation hydrodynamics is a core subject in astrophysics, and for many phenomena asphericities either accompany or are fundamental to the underlying theory. BETHE uses novel mixed-frame radiation transport that is straightforward to implement, generalizable to multiple dimensions, accurate and relatively fast. The hydrodynamics solver is an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method and uses arbitrary grids providing flexibility to tailor the grid to the computational challenge. Together, these characteristics allow for unique multidimensional simulations of astrophysical phenomena. In particular, Dr. Murphy will (1) address the viability of the neutrino and acoustic mechanisms for core-collapse supernovae, (2) simulate winds from oblate hot stars, and (3) investigate whether proposed mechanisms for luminous-blue-variable outbursts can reproduce, in the context of rapidly rotating stars, the observations of Eta Carinae's Homunculus.Dr. Murphy will also be actively involved with the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP), which seeks to retain a diverse student body in the University of Washington Astronomy Department. Pre-MAP targets first-year students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences (women, first-generation and low-income college students, African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders) with two primary goals: to engage students' interest and enthusiasm through research and to provide a supportive community, enabling their success. Dr. Murphy's roles will be to mentor Pre-MAP students, to offer simulation results to analyze, to support field trips and research, and, most importantly, to evaluate and improve the program."

Phase II development will be validated by an independent evaluation that measures the products effects on achievement and interest in science.This project will play a role in increasing achievement and interest in science. In order for the nation to remain competitive in the life sciences, the nation must produce an adequate number of students who pursue  degrees in life sciences.  The proposed research is targeted at improving students' interest and achievement in science, and thus greatly impact the disturbing drop in recent years in United States' student interest in pursuing science education and careers, and the rapid increase in demand in the labor market for science-based degrees for the labor market."
18661,NSF,NSF,"Building upon the success of the tri-annual MidWest topology seminars, graduate students in Geometry and Topology from several MidWest institutions began an annual  Graduate Student Topology Conference. Now in its sixth year, the University of Illinois will be hosting the conference in 2008. The plenary speakers will be Mike Hopkins from Harvard and Yael Karshon from Toronto. In addition, 27 talks by graduate students, run in parallel sessions, will be delivered. The grant is primarily to provide travel assistance for participants and speakers. The conference will run two days and provide ample opportunities for informal discussions and new introductions to occur. Historically, these conferences have provided an excellent opportunity for positive support and fruitful collaborations to begin. The result has often been to increase student's success rate both in school and during the critical transition soon after finishing ones doctorate. Because of the traditionally high participation rate among usually under represented demographics at these conferences combined with the conferences effectiveness as an aid to students during a critical transition period, partially supporting the approximately 160 participants is an effective investment in the science.The Graduate Student Topology Conference is a two-day event in which graduate students from across the country meet to share their work, gain experience presenting at conferences, and hear from some of the most distinguished geometry and topology professors in the nation.

Additionally, the experience of presenting at a conference allows speakers to refine their speaking skills and grow into more effective communicators. The conference also encourages communication among different geographic regions. Participants come from very diverse schools all across the country and include graduate students at all years of study with a high participation rate among usually under represented demographics."
18662,NSF,NSF,"Profs. Igor Kaltashov and Stephen Eyles at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to investigate the structure, assembly, and dynamic properties of biomolecules and synthetic polymers using electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. Their studies probe the charge states exhibited in ESI mass spectra under carefully controlled experimental conditions to evaluate solution phase conformations. The goal is to develop a powerful tool for solving a diverse set of problems in biophysics and nanotechnology. Of particular interest are the molecular mechanisms of blood clotting modulated by the oligosaccharide heparin, the conformational transitions of intrinsically disordered proteins that can lead to disease states, and understanding how proteins conjugated to synthetic polymers - a rapidly expanding field in therapeutic drug development - interact with their biological targets.Broader impacts of the research stem from the development of a comprehensive experimental strategy for probing macromolecular conformation and dynamics in complex multi-component systems - capability urgently needed in diverse fields ranging from biophysics to nanomedicine. In pursuing these aims, a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students engages in interdisciplinary scientific discovery involving high end mass spectrometry instrumentation, providing a valuable training arena to young scientists."
18758,NSF,HHS,"Nearly all multi-cellular organisms have mechanisms that allow specific tissues to withstand substantial mechanical stress without rupture or permanent deformation. These mechanisms often involve structures composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (e.g. elastin and fibrillin) that assemble into elastic fibers or elastic fiber-like structures that can stretch and flex but return to their original shape once force is removed. Information obtained from studies of elastic polymers found in nature has numerous potential applications in materials science, medicine and military projects (e.g. in tissue grafts, protective clothing and energy-absorbing soundproofing). The PI and co-workers have discovered novel elastic fiber-like structures in the nematode C. elegans that connect pharynx and adjacent muscle cells, and have named these structures nematode elastic fibers (NEFs). As the animals forage for food, NEFs stretch, bend, flex and pivot and help to position the pharynx in the center of the body cavity. In previous work, Dr. Vogel has identified two essential components of the NEF: the highly conserved ECM proteins hemicentin and fibulin-1D. These proteins co-assemble at NEFs and two other cell junctions that are also flexible and resistant to mechanical stress. The specific aims of the current proposal utilize the power of the C. elegans genetic system to: 1) dissect the mechanism of hemicentin and fibulin-1D assembly into NEFs and 2) determine the composition of these intriguing elastic polymers by identifying the other molecular NEF components. The long-term goals are to define the essential requirements for assembling NEFs, to assemble NEFs or NEF-like structures in vitro and a detailed analysis of the mechanical/biophysical properties of these intriguing structures. The intellectual merit lies in the potential to provide detailed information into the assembly and composition of a novel type of cell junction. Although cell-cell and cell-ECM junctions have been the focus of intense investigation, hemicentin and fibulin-1D are unique in that they always assemble in a sandwich at junctions between cells (cell-ECM-cell) where they form a novel type of elastic and flexible biological glue.There are two aspects of broader impacts that pertain to this project.  One is the potential for societal benefit through the likelihood that the work will have relevance for materials science and bioengineering of synthetic biocompatible elastic materials that would be useful in a variety of applications.   In addition to the potential utility of the research itself, another broader impact of the proposed research will be to utilize C. elegans as an ideal model organism to teach basic concepts in biology. In conjunction with the experimental goals of the research, molecular biology and genetics learning modules will be developed for UMBIs established, state-wide science education program. This program consists of three components that serve Maryland K-12 students: 1) UMBIs on-site teaching laboratory 2) Maryland Loaner Lab (MDLL) in which the necessary equipment and consumables are sent to teachers so they can enhance their lab offerings and integrate new curriculum in their classrooms and 3) a 32-station mobile teaching laboratory housed in a tractor trailer that travels throughput the state of Maryland to provide hands-on laboratory education for K-12 students. An additional benefit is that separate teacher professional development programs are available through all three components designed to provide teachers with an opportunity to expand their laboratory skills and enhance the content of their bioscience instruction."
18804,NSF,NSF,"Globalization has increased the frequency and intensity of exposure to other cultures. The research proposed here seeks to identify the social cognitive principles that explain and predict variations in people's psychological reactions when they are exposed to foreign culture.  Exposure to foreign cultures may produce a broad range of psychological impacts, from inciting exclusionary, nationalist sentiments to inspiring novel, creative ideas.   In the proposed research, the psychological impacts of foreign cultural exposure will be studied in a laboratory setting. Six experiments using an innovative paradigm will examine the psychological effects of simultaneous activation of cultures. In this paradigm, iconic priming is used to activate representations of two cultures simultaneously.  It is hypothesized that stereotype-consistent information about a culture will be encoded elaborately and remembered well and that previously encoded information will be assimilated into the cultural stereotypes.  In addition, the researcher proposes to test several other hypotheses including the self-categorization hypothesis, the cultural learning hypothesis, and the serial reproduction hypothesis.  By focusing on the social cognitive consequences of simultaneous activation of culture, findings from this work will promote a new behavioral science perspective on current debates arising over the psychological impacts of intercultural contacts in the context of globalization."
18813,NSF,HHS,"It is widely believed that a biological system centered on RNA or RNA-like biopolymer, preceded the DNA-, RNA-, and protein-containing system that now dominates. However, this  RNA world  is now disjointed from modern biochemistry and current understanding does not make clear how it could have given rise to the present world through a continuous set of evolutionary steps. The purpose of this research is to explore the hypothesis that the modern ribosome is a molecular fossil of the primordial RNA replicase. In a broader sense, the research aims to address the transition from a hypothetical RNA organism to the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). To do this, the research group of the Principal Investigator will explore whether the ribosome that currently performs carbon-centered amide and ester bond formation can also perform phosphate-centered transesterification reactions indicative of ribozyme-like chemistry in the same active site. The research group will also investigate the structural plausibility of adaptor-mediated replication in the context of the modern translation apparatus rather than the template-directed replication model that has dominated since the early work of Watson and Crick. The broader impact of this project lies in its effort to enhance both university and pre-university science education related to the themes of the research, through formal coursework, mentoring, and science demonstrations."
18824,NSF,NSF,"This project is in the field of commutative algebra, especially Noetherian algebras and more especially polynomial rings over fields.The research in this proposal is directed at understanding the asymptotics of equations and their reduction modulo large prime numbers. Such asymptotics are captured through local cohomology, Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities, symbolic powers, and tight closure.The methods proposed are in part classical methods as well as those being developed by the proposer. The project also studies homological algebra, especially in terms of the graded Betti numbers and in terms of rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type. A new asymptotic length function for local cohomology is proposed with applications to the homological conjectures, especially the monomial conjecture. Additional problems are proposed on the theory of liaison, especially regarding comparing the local and homogeneous versions, as well as understanding Gorenstein liaison classes.Commutative algebra arose from the 19th century study of polynomial equations in many variables, and their solutions. The relationship between polynomial equations and geometry goes back at least to Descartes and the idea of coordinatizing the plane.Commutative algebra studies the solutions of such polynomial or power series equations by forming an algebraic object, called a ring, which consists of the 'generic' solutions.The algebraic properties of these generic solutions then give insight into the geometric and algebraic nature of the solutions. An important technique in this field has been to study such equations by reducing the coefficients modulo prime numbers for all large primes. A particular example of this has been the explosive development of the theory of tight closure over the last twenty years. Commutative algebra combines techniques from a number of other areas including combinatorics, topology, and analysis."
18835,NSF,HHS,"Myxococcus xanthus is a novel model for system-level study of control mechanisms for emergent behavior, and thus the selective advantages of cooperation and of concomitant loss of cellular autonomy. A swarm of M. xanthus is a population of millions of individual autonomous cells that function together as a single machine, coordinating movement through signals and creating dynamic patterns in response to environmental cues, a process called self-organization (SO). One such response, called development, is controlled through a cascade of transcriptional regulators (TRs), which are proteins that activate or deactivate other genes. All SO in M. xanthus could be under this type of control. Two distinct SO behaviors have already been quantified: development, a starvation response in which cells coordinate to form fruiting bodies, and tracking, directed movement of a swarm toward a nutrient source. Mutant strains were created for each of 310 TRs, and those specific for development or tracking were selected, using microarrays to identify the genes likely to be affected by each TR. Candidate genes were then disrupted to confirm the predicted functional associations. The goal of this project is to understand the role of TRs in controlling bacterial SO, using an approach that integrates genomics, computer analysis, automated microscopy, and experimental genetics to identify and characterize genetic control of two distinct emergent behaviors in M. xanthus. This project offers undergraduates, graduates and post-doctoral researchers unique opportunities to deepen their theoretical understanding of biology while gaining critical computer skills. This work is the foundation for Dr. Welch's career research goal to identify and articulate the genetic networks that control multicellular behavior, ultimately yielding critical insights into the origins of multicellularity and genetic control of formation of 3-dimensional structures."
18860,NSF,HHS,"This is an equipment grant to purchase eye-tracking and display technology to support multidisciplinary research on the use of virtual environments as a medium for the study of human behavior. The research program uses an immersive, interactive bicycling simulator to study how child and adult cyclists make decisions about crossing traffic-filled roads, and a large-screen immersive display system to study spatial perception in real and virtual environments. Using the new instrumentation, the project will: 1) Integrate an eye-tracking and head-tracking system with the existing interactive bicycling simulator to conduct studies of visual attention during road crossing,  2) Test how projecting stereo images and a ground surface adds to the realism and effectiveness of a large-screen display system, and  3) Compare a large-screen display system with a head-mounted display system to investigate how display characteristics impact spatial perception.New instrumentation will expand current facilities in four important ways: 1) adding eye tracking to the high fidelity bicycling simulator, 2) upgrading large screen displays with stereo projection, 3) adding a ground display to the bicycling simulator, and 4) acquiring a head-mounted display system. By increasing and testing the realism and effectiveness of different types of immersive, interactive virtual environments, and developing new computational techniques for integrating virtual environment technology with other cutting-edge technologies, research using this infrastructure will advance the development of state-of-the-art virtual environments as laboratories for the study of human behavior.The research made possible by this infrastructure will contribute to both our understanding of the development of perception-action coupling during late childhood and early adolescence and to our understanding of the underlying causes of child bicycling injuries. The results will lay a foundation for future intervention studies designed to reduce car-bicycle collisions. Advances made on this project in simulation technology, in experimental methodology, and in our understanding of distance perception will contribute to the development of virtual environments for use in behavioral research. This research will also have impact on interactive simulation technology for training, teaching, and entertainment purposes. Finally, this project will promote multidisciplinary training by providing collaborative research experience to a diverse group of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs in psychology and computer science."
18861,NSF,NSF,"SGER: Characterization of the Precambrian Aquifer at the Homestake DUSELProject SummaryAn unprecedented window of opportunity currently exists for subsurface hydrological studies at the Homestake DUSEL in the Black Hills, South Dakota.  Rocks at the site consist primarily of fractured Precambrian metasediments and form a regional groundwater system possessing largely unknown and undefined hydrologic properties.  If not instrumented in the near future, this unique opportunity will be lost.  The former Homestake Gold Mine operated continuously from 1876 to 2001.  Mine workings in the gold deposit followed the Homestake formation along 4 miles of plunge, penetrating through a volume of crust 1.7 x 1.9 x 3.1 miles with >320 miles of drift.  The rock sequence was folded several times and tilted toward the southeast during the Precambrian.  Laramide tectonism raised the Black Hills to their current configuration and was accompanied by brittle fracture, most likely creating the fractures presently observed in the mine.   Groundwater was pumped continuously from the Precambrian aquifer during the operation of the mine and pumps were turned off in 2003 after the mine closed.  Post-closure flooding has resulted in more than 3000' of water rise and is currently between the 4850-ft level and the 5000-ft level.  Current plans are for pumps to be turned on in mid-December 2007 to reduce the water level to the 5300-ft level.    Hydrologic properties of the Precambrian aquifer are relatively unknown.  Pre-closure research has shown that about 2/3 of the current 750 gal/min inflow rate originate from flow through the fractured aquifer rocks.  Bulk permeability has been estimated, based on inflow rates and the volume of mine openings, at about 10-6 to 10-7 cm/sec.    The research described in this proposal seeks to measure falling water levels in the mine as it is dewatered and to determine the hydrologic properties of the Precambrian aquifer.  Pressure sensors will be lowered into the water column at the No. 6 shaft, either the No. 3 shaft which extends to the 5000-ft. level or the service shaft which extends to the 6800-ft level (service shaft may not be accessible), the No. 4 shaft which extends to the 7400-ft. level, and the No. 5 air intake shaft which extends to the 6200-ft. level.  Sensors will be lowered, as required, into the falling water column as the pumping proceeds.  Exact sensor placement will depend on access and will be determined with the cooperation of the SDSTA. Analysis of water-level data will be achieved using various models and tested for appropriateness of hydraulic conductivity determinations, including modifications for fracture flow and other factors.  Models designed for flow into tunnels will also be used.  The results, in turn, can provide new information about the hydrology of fluid flow within a volume of the crust and in determination of hydrologic properties of the local Precambrian aquifer.Microclimatic conditions (temperature, humidity, pressure, and wet bulb temperature) in the underground spaces will be measured concurrently with water reduction data.  Meteorological stations underground will be located on the 400, 1200, 2400, 3600, and 4850-ft. levels (or nearest accessible levels).  Two stations will be placed on each level, one near the shaft and one up to 1000 feet in the drift.  As the water level in the mine is reduced, and the surface inflow is intercepted, subsurface climatic changes will begin to occur.  Further changes will occur as the mine goes from its current non-ventilated state into a fully ventilated sate.  These climatic changes will be important to various experiments as the mine is prepared for the long-term science and engineering program.  These early monitoring efforts will provide valuable information on the initial conditions of the research facility, while helping to establish a long-term monitoring effort. All collected data pertaining to hydrology and microclimate will be placed on a web server, either at Homestake or SDSM&T, and be made available to all interested parties."
18877,NSF,HHS,"The PI will incorporate recent research results from behavioral economics into the theory of welfare economics. Interest in psychological approaches to economic questions has grown in recent years, stimulated largely by accumulating evidence that the standard economic model of consumer decision-making may provide an inadequate description of human behavior.   Behavioral  economic theories that incorporate non-standard components (motivated by psychological evidence) are increasingly finding their way into policy evaluation, which inevitably involves what economists call  welfare analysis  (that is, assessments of well-being). Yet these new theories fundamentally challenge our ability to formulate appropriate criteria for judging whether outcomes are  good  or  bad.   If, contrary to the traditional assumption in economics, an individual's choices do not reflect coherent preferences, how can those choices provide economists with a basis for judging whether one outcome is better than another?This project develops, applies, and refines a unified framework for policy evaluation that encompasses the new generation of behavioral economic theories.  The framework developed here is a natural extension of standard welfare economics.  The standard approach is based on choice.  In its simplest form, it advises a policy maker to respect the choices an individual would make for himself.  The guiding principle behind that approach is an extension of the libertarian deference to freedom of choice, which takes the view that it is better to give a person the thing he would choose for himself rather than something that someone else would choose for him.  The central premise of this project is that the same principle remains applicable even when people behave in ways that are inconsistent with standard economic assumptions.  Although the guidance provided by people's choices may be ambiguous in some circumstances, it is typically unambiguous in others, and this partially ambiguous guidance can provide a foundation for rigorous policy evaluation.  The project develops a general framework for policy evaluation and explores its implications for particular behavioral theories.  It also reexamines an assortment of public policies, employing generalizations of the standard tools that economists conventionally use when evaluating the desirability of public policies.  The broader impact of this work will follow directly from its focus on developing appropriate criteria for evaluating public policies.  Previous studies that have employed non-standard behavioral models in the context of public policy analysis have generally relied on ad hoc criteria for assessing the relative desirability of different outcomes. This project will revisit many of those policy issues, such as the design of capital income taxes and social security, to identify conclusions that are rigorously justified based on the application of the new framework.  In addition, this work enables greater integration of economics, psychology, and neuroscience.  Specifically, it allows economists to conduct rigorous welfare analysis using literally any model of behavior, including ones imported from other fields, regardless of whether those models depict behavior as reflecting optimization."
18883,NSF,NSF,"Intellectual MeritBased on theory, laboratory experiments and field observations, canyons have long been identified as sites of intense internal waves. Turbulence measurements in Monterey Canyon (MC) and density overturns in Kaoping Canyon (Taiwan), which has similar size and shape, confirm very strong mixing. The processes generating the mixing, however, have not been determined, nor has mixing been measured in enough canyons to assess its variability from one to another. Observations and recent modeling indicate that the internal tide is a major source of energy in Monterey Canyon, coming from offshore as well as being generated locally. In addition, ridges and constrictions along the canyon make it likely that lee waves and hydraulic jumps are also major sources of mixing, as has been inferred for abyssal canyons.The project will undertake modeling and intensive observations for Monterey Canyon and exploration of nearby Ascension Canyon which is much straighter than Monterey and apparently lacks a significant offshore source for the internal tide. The goals are to: 1) understand how the internal tide propagates in canyons, and in particular how the M2 energy flux is steered around bends and when turns are so sharp that the energy is dissipated, 2) determine whether mixing locations and levels can be predicted by convergences in the along-canyon M2 energy flux, 3) identify and quantify mixing produced by internal wave scattering, lee waves and hydraulic jumps, and 4) assess the effects that canyon shape, smoothness and alignment with offshore M2 sources have on mixing and baroclinic energy by measuring mixing and the internal tide in a relatively short, straight canyon ending on the outer shelf.Broader ImpactsU.S. coasts have dozens of canyons, and they account for almost half of the western continental slope from 45N to Alaska. Though they appear to be biologically rich and export both water and sediments, dynamical processes within canyons are too poorly understood to make a general assessment of the importance of canyons or whether they require special representation in large-scale or regional models. One set of measurements cannot resolve all questions about canyon dynamics, but the proposed work should provide qualitative and quantitative bases for assessing mixing in other canyons.. If fully successful, this project may unable the parameterization of some of the mixing or at least be able to point the way to parameterizations. As part of the proposed effort the investigators have also begun talks with regional modelers to incorporate intense canyon mixing into the models and to do sensitivity runs to define how accurately the mixing must be known to predict its effect on flows and structures outside the canyon. Two post-doc will be hired, one at APL/UW and another at the University of Hawaii. Both willparticipate in all phases of the work for their postdoctoral training. Coordination and collaboration with the regular MBARI sampling of Monterey Bay will benefit this project, and vice versa. Outreach activities will combine earlier canyon measurements and the future measurements."
18892,NSF,NSF,"PI: Edwin AmentaTitle: Strengthening Qualitative Research Through Methodological Innovation and Integration:  A New Approach to Understanding Social Movement OrganizationsSES-0752571Project AbstractTo understand social change and the politics of the disadvantaged one needs to understand social movement organizations and their media coverage.  Movement organizations provide critical resources to seek social change, help to construct political identities and interests, and spur collective civic engagement, and scholars agree that the attention of the mass news media is critical to the struggles of challengers and is a mark of their influence.  But there is no big empirical picture of any aspect of the rise, decline, and persistence of movement organizations across movements and over time.  To fill this major gap, the investigators propose to collect new data on articles in which U.S. movement organizations were mentioned in national newspapers--the New York Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, and Los Angeles Times, since the populist movement of the 1890s.  These data are now available through ProQuest Historical Newspapers and will be collected electronically.  These data will allow the researchers to address several fundamental questions about movement organizations and families: Which U.S. movement organizations and families have received the greatest newspaper coverage since the 1890s?  Are they the ones that movement scholarship would lead us to expect?  How has coverage changed over time overall and across movements?  How does coverage compare to standard, limited measures of movement organizational scale or activity, such as organizational density, membership, resource mobilization, and protest events? Are there systematic biases in coverage of movement organizations similar to the biases surrounding the coverage of protest events?  Can coverage figures serve as a partial substitute for data much less easily generated? Are the historical trajectories of coverage consistent with the main theories of social movements?  The investigators will address these questions and assess the main theories of movements through methodological innovation and integration: by synthesizing historical investigation, formal qualitative analyses, and time-series regression.  One of the most important impacts of the project will be the first long-term mapping of the movements and organizations that have made the greatest imprints on the public consciousness over more than a century.  This big picture of movement organizations will be of considerable interest to the general public and policymakers.  The project will also promote greater understanding of today's social movements, such as the environmental, feminist, and Christian right movements through a comparison with past movements such as the prohibition, labor, and civil rights movements. The project will also advance social theory, methodological integration, and training of graduate students."
18895,NSF,NSF,"CCF-0746910CAREER: System Support for Implicitly Parallel ProgrammingMatthew I. FrankWhile multi-core processor designs allow peak performance to track Moore's law, they introduce new challenges for software developers.  Explicitly multi-threaded programs generally take longer to develop, test, debug, and verify than sequential programs with equivalent functionality.  Implicit parallelization, on the other hand, allows software engineers to develop parallel algorithms and applications in environments that provide sequential semantics, like the C programming language.  System tools convert the parallel algorithms into a set of threads partitioned appropriately for a particular parallel machine organization.  The resulting parallel programs are easier and faster to develop, debug, and maintain, because the programmer can request a meaningful and well defined program state at any point of execution.  Because error checking code, code reuse, and variable scoping interfere with naive parallelization, this work will investigate system tools that perform reactive and speculative transformations to reduce the tension between application robustness and parallelization."
18899,NSF,NSF,"This proposal deals with the problem of inference based on statistics whose asymptotic distributions are discontinuous functions of the true distribution that generates the observations. Numerous problems in econometrics and other areas of statistics exhibit this feature.   The proposal involves a combination of (i) the development of new and improved general methods for inference based on statistics with asymptotic discontinuities and (ii) further analysis of particular models where asymptotic discontinuities arise. General methods that are not based on subsampling or the m out of n bootstrap are developed. The motivation for this is that there are reasons to believe that subsampling and m out of n bootstrap-based tests do not provide as high power as is possible in models with asymptotic discontinuities. In addition, the latter methods are well known to exhibit relatively large errors in asymptotic size.Considerable effort will be devoted to moment inequality models. For such models, this project investigates a new class of generalized moment selection procedures and recursive size-correction procedures.   The project introduces new procedures for conditional moment inequality models.   It analyzes existing and develops new confidence sets and tests in nonlinear regression, ARMA(1, 1), threshold AR, and stochastic dominance models, all of which exhibit asymptotic discontinuities. Finally, this project undertakes research on the asymptotic risk of estimators and measures of uncertainly in the context of asymptotic discontinuities.On a different topic, this project studies a new method of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (HAC) inference based on combining ideas in Ibragimov and Müller (2006) and Andrews (2004). Finally, the project continues research initiated in Andrews, Moreira, and Stock (2006) on optimal inference with weak instruments.  This research focuses on inference in the presence of heteroskedasticity.The broader impact of the proposed research includes the following. (i) The proposed research will benefit society through improved empirical methods that lead to more accurate empirical research and, consequently, better informed policy analysis.(ii) The research will promote teaching and training through the use of graduate students as research assistants and collaborative researchers and through the development of lecture notes related to the sponsored research. (iii) The research will involve groups that are under-represented in economics and econometrics, in particular women. Four of the graduate students that the PI will work with, viz., Xu Cheng, Yaxin Duan, Sun-Young Park, and Xiaoxia Shi, are women. (iv) The research will enhance infrastructure by making new computer software available for use by the profession.  (v) The results of the research will be disseminated broadly via presentation at international conferences"
18935,NSF,NSF,"Representation is a central construct in the creative process.  Exploring alternate representations can significantly increase the quality of artifacts created, and using multiple representations enables creators to broadly consider the multifaceted nature of the problem spaces they explore.  Narrative offers an ideal laboratory for investigating multiple representations in the creative process because stories can be expressed in rich text (a static, uni-modal representation) re-represented in animated stories with accompanying narration and spoken dialogue (a dynamic, multimodal representation).  The objective of the proposed research is to design, build, and empirically evaluate an interactive creativity environment that facilitates the exploration of alternate representations in the creative process.  In particular, the proposed work will focus on the Narrative Theatre, an interactive narrative-centered creativity environment.The project will yield a cognitive account of creativity that will inform the design of next-generation creativity environments.  By promoting rich interactions that are simultaneously effective and engaging, it will find broad application in education and training technologies.  The project will increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities.  It will involve a diverse population in the  Narrative Theatre user studies, it will involve women in all aspects of the research, it will train undergraduates through involvement in formal and informal research exposure efforts, and it will increase the participation of women and underrepresented groups in computer science through interaction with the STARS Alliance."
18997,NSF,NSF,"The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is the creation of new models to make material supply decisions and project management decisions jointly in project-driven supply chains (PDSCs). Most real world projects require material supplies at various stages. Thus, a PDSC is a combination of project activities and material supply chains where the demand for the latter is driven by the material requirement of the former. Supply chain decisions (e.g., material planning, inventory control) and project management decisions (e.g., resource planning, project scheduling) are intertwined in PDSCs. The research will integrate recent advances in supply chain management and project management to create models and solution algorithms that can help firms coordinate these decisions in PDSCs under uncertainty. The research approach progresses from simple PDSCs to general PDSCs under real-world constraints, from deterministic approximations to stochastic modeling, and from centralized optimization issues to decentralized mechanism design issues. If successful, the research will bring supply chain planning and project management into an integrated solution that streamlines material supplies with project activity planning, and thus leads to both reduced system-wide cost and reduced project durations. It does so by providing models, structural results, planning tools and managerial insights that can guide firms' actions in coordinating project decisions and material supply chain decisions under uncertainty. The results will be disseminated through Rutgers Center for Supply Chain Management and Rutgers Lerner Center for Pharmaceutical Management Studies to pharmaceutical, manufacturing and healthcare organizations. The outcomes of the research will renovate current standard curricula in operations management by introducing new modules that integrate project management with supply chain management for consumable materials, with applications in manufacturing, construction and product development. Graduate and undergraduate students will also benefit through involvement in case studies and research."

19059,NSF,NSF,"AbstractZhengThe proposal is for partial funding of the 24-th Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) and Shanks lectures at Vanderbilt University, from March 5 to 9, 2008. The purpose of this supplement is to request funding to help defer the expenses of graduate students, minorities, women, and recent doctoral recipients in an effort to give them the opportunity to participate in the conference. The SEAM conference was first held at Virginia Tech. in 1985. Since then its location has rotated among the institutions in the southeast. The annual Shanks Lectures at the Department of Mathematics, Vanderbilt University date back to 1985.  The SEAM affords established and new researchers, and advanced graduate students, the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas and discuss the wide variety of mathematics encompassed within modern and classical analysis. In particular, the conference has traditionally provided an opportunity for young researchers to present their work and to discuss their research with more experienced mathematicians. The diverse topics presented during the conference provide a unique opportunity to see the wide variety of problems in analysis.   The Shanks Lectures have played a prominent role in the Mathematics Department at Vanderbilt University for the past 23 years. The lecturer for this conference will be Charles Fefferman, Princeton University.  NSF's funding will be used completely for participants' support. Priority will be given to members of underrepresented groups, graduate students, postdocs, and younger faculty."
19068,NSF,NSF,"The Principal Investigator (PI) will develop an integrated model of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flare emissions that fully accounts for the energy released during such eruptive events. This will make it possible to relate the observed properties of emissions in the lower corona to the velocity and acceleration of resulting CMEs. This project will improve upon the PI's previous work by using a sophisticated numerical CME model developed by SAIC to gain new insights into CME energy release, reconnection physics, and dynamics. Flare emission from simulated events will also be modeled, allowing connections between CMEs and flares to be explored. This project will elucidate the fundamental physics underlying eruptive phenomena on the Sun.The PI will create an interactive, hands-on solar physics exhibit at the Boston Museum of Science, and she is currently developing content for an exhibit on solar astronomy at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. During this project, the PI will also serve as a mentor to three young women scientists at the beginning of their careers.

19081,NSF,NSF,"The focus of this project is on the total synthesis of the phomactin family of natural products.   Specifically this involves the synthesis of Phomactins A, B, B1, C, D, E, F, G and H, all platelet activating factor antagonists.  The two key steps in the strategy involve the cyclohexadienone annulation reaction of Fischer carbene complexes with alkynes and the ring closing metathesis reaction with Grubbs carbene complexes.  Since most of the phomactins have not been previously synthesized, the conversion of the key bicyclo[9.3.1]pentadecane to each of the targets will require the exploration of new territory and undoubtedly the development of new chemistry as well as the testing of hypotheses formulated from a consideration of probable biosynthetic pathways.  With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor William D. Wulff in the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University.  Professor Wulff's research efforts are concentrated on the development of the chemistry of Fischer carbene complexes for the advancement of the field of organic synthesis.  The successful development of the proposed chemistry will contribute to the discovery and production of new products with societal benefits by the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agrochemical industries."
19117,NSF,HHS,"CCF-0746856CAREER: Systematic Software Testing Using Test AbstractionsDarko MarinovSoftware testing is important for increasing software reliability, but expensive and can account for more than half of the software development cost.  Automated testing can significantly help programmers to develop and maintain reliable software.  However, test automation is mainly limited to test execution, while test generation remains manual and mostly ad hoc, which not only makes it hard to develop tests initially but also to maintain and reuse tests.To reduce the cost of developing, maintaining, and reusing tests, this project investigates a novel approach to automated testing based on test abstractions.  Conceptually, each test abstraction provides a high-level description of a desired test suite: programmers do not need to manually write large suites of individual tests but instead write only test abstractions from which tools automatically generate individual tests.  This project investigates five aspects of test abstractions: (1) What languages to use for writing test abstractions?  (2) Which tests to generate from test abstractions? (3) How to automatically generate tests from test abstractions? (4) How to determine whether the code under test passed or failed? (5) How to determine which failing tests are caused by the same code error?"
19127,NSF,NSF,"Rice 0739444This award supports a project to study the mode of formation and causes of glacial earthquakes.  The paradigm for glacial flow has been that glaciers flow in a viscous manner, with major changes in the force balance occurring on the decade timescale or longer. The recent discovery of a number of even shorter timescale events has challenged this paradigm. In 2003, it was discovered that Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica displays stick-slip behavior on the 10-30 minute timescale, with ice stream speed increasing by a factor of 30 from already high speeds. In the past year, the minimum timescale has been pushed shorter by recognition that a class of recently discovered 50-second-long, magnitude-5 earthquakes are closely associated with changes in the force balance near the calving fronts of large outlet glaciers in both Greenland and East Antarctica.  With no adequate theory existing to explain these relatively large earthquakes associated with outlet glaciers, we have begun to investigate the physical mechanisms that must be involved in allowing such a response in a system traditionally not thought capable of generating large variations in forces over timescales less than 100 seconds. The intellectual merit of the work is that large-amplitude, short-timescale variability of glaciers is an important mode of glacier dynamics that has not yet been understood from a first-principles physics perspective.  The proposed research addresses this gap in understanding, tying together knowledge from numerous disciplines including glaciology, seismology and fault rupture dynamics, laboratory rock physics, granular flow, fracture mechanics, and hydrogeology.  The broader impacts of the work are that there is societal as well as general scientific interest in the stability of the major ice sheets. However, without an understanding of the physical processes governing short time scale variability, it is unlikely that we will be able accurately predict the future of these ice sheets and their impact on sea level changes. The project will also contribute to the development and education of young scientists."
19148,NSF,HHS,"Functional and Structural Evolution of Gonadotropin-Releasing HormoneSuccessful reproduction in all vertebrates depends upon the action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).  Because GnRH is present in diverse animals ranging from mammals to tunicates, it is hypothesized that GnRH may have already been present 630 million years ago in an ancestor that gave rise to vertebrates and invertebrates.  If proven, GnRH could be one of the most ancient hormones to persist through evolution.  As such, its evolutionary pattern could reveal much about how an important hormone changed its function and structure over time.  Dr. Tsai's recent data that a GnRH-like molecule is present in the sea slug, Aplysia californica, proved that GnRH arose very early during evolution.  This project utilizes a combination of molecular, cellular and whole organism approaches to characterize the receptor for Aplysia GnRH (ap-GnRH) and to understand what ap-GnRH does in the sea slug.  This project will also allow Dr. Tsai to train graduate and undergraduate students interested in hormone evolution and strengthen collaborative ties with other trainees in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department.  In sum, this project will contribute substantially to our understanding of how evolutionary selection pressures drive changes in hormone structures and functions, and how these changes allow the organism to adapt better to the environment."
19199,NSF,HHS,"This grant provides funding for the development of efficient computational methods to determine optimal ordering policies for inventory control problems with multiple products and correlated demands. While the problem is fairly easy and well solved for the single product case, methods to tract the multiple product case face a significant challenge due to the dimensionality of the problem. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, this work proposes on developing a method based on the moving boundary approach. Under a moving boundary framework, one begins with an initial guess for the optimal policy and an estimate of the value of using that policy. If one can then come up with a boundary update procedure that is akin to policy improvement, is monotone and guarantees convergence, then one can to a large extent simplify the complexity involved in solving multi-dimensional problems. An inventory control game is also proposed alongside the development of the research where participants try controlling multi-product inventory levels in the presence of stochastic demand, competing not only against each other but also against the optimal policy.Success in this work would have an impact in two areas. In the area of inventory control, this would be the first computational method that can solve problems that are of the real-world size, with a large number of product types. Second, the proposed method in general develops a moving boundary approach to solving impulse control problems. Impulse control problems arise in a variety of areas that include finance, economics and queuing theory. Hence researchers would potentially be able to extend or adapt the method for their purposes in these other areas. The stochastic control game can provide a direct feel for the challenges in decision making under uncertainty and enrich the learning experience of students taking courses that cover inventory control."
19227,NSF,HHS,"With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Gregory K. Friestad of the Chemistry Department at the University of Iowa.  The project focuses on the development of new stereoselective methods to achieve asymmetric amine synthesis via free radical addition reactions.  In particular, these studies will expand the scope and improve the efficiency of Mn-mediated radical additions, provide new methods for the construction of quaternary carbon stereocenters, and investigate asymmetric catalysis of radical additions to C=N bonds.  A new radical addition approach to chiral amines, involving addition to the C=C bond of chiral enamides with subsequent stereoselective trapping by tandem bond constructions, will be studied. This project will contribute to knowledge of the chemistry of radical addition reactions that generate chiral amines.  Since chiral amines play crucial roles in pharmaceutical chemistry, these investigations are expected to have broad impact on research in the health sciences.  This project will also provide important undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training in preparation for careers in health sciences research."
19236,NSF,HHS,"The scientific goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which the external environment shapes the way the nervous system is wired. The brains of developing organisms face an immense challenge since they must allow the organisms to function within their environment even while the nervous system is not yet fully developed. It is not fully known how the brain achieves the balance between early function and the need to remain flexible. One strategy employed by the brain to achieve this is through a process called neural plasticity, which allows brain circuits to adapt to patterns of sensory input received from the external environment. This project uses the developing visual system of frog tadpoles as a model for early brain development. Experiments will study the correlation between the developmental emergence of visually-guided swimming behavior to the properties of tiny electrical signals generated in the tadpole brain in response to visual stimuli. This will allow investigators to first map neural circuits involved in processing visual stimuli and then to understand the role of the visual environment in building this circuitry through neural plasticity. For example, if visual input is required for proper wiring of visual circuits, then tadpoles raised in a dark environment or under conditions in which communication between the eye and brain is disrupted, are expected to develop abnormally. This study will also focus on mechanisms by which the brain can adapt to deficits in sensory input to achieve normal function. Together, these experiments will provide important insight into the mechanisms by which the brain's complex circuitry emerges during development and which allow it to adapt to a changing environment. A second goal of this project is to develop an educational program which will allow high-school students from underrepresented minority groups to engage first-hand in this research. This program will allow for two students each year to come to Brown and participate in a basic Neuroscience course and work in Dr. Aizenman's laboratory over the summer. The ultimate goal is to encourage these students to pursue a career in the life sciences by providing first-hand laboratory experience and mentoring. In addition, the program will also provide training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in the laboratory."
19257,NSF,NSF,"This project uses experimental methods to investigate individual behavior in different contest games. A contest game is defined as a situation in which individuals or groups compete with one another by expanding effort or cost to win a specific prize. Examples range from college admissions and competition for a promotion, to global relationships in which different countries and political parties expend resources to lobby their own interests.This project consists of three parts. The first part targets the issue of asymmetric valuations between different payers and the effect of timing in contests. Contest theory predicts that more asymmetric contests generate higher competition than symmetric contests. It is also found that the effect of timing crucially depends on the order in which players make their decisions. These predictions are tested using laboratory experiments.The second part of this project studies competition between heterogeneous groups. The existing literature is built mostly on voting models in which a subjects' choice space is limited to a binary decision: whether to cast a vote or not. By contrast, in this project subjects can make their decisions on continuous strategy space. The heterogeneity between groups arises from the differences between the players within each group. The following testable hypothesis are derived from the theory: only players with the highest valuation in each group expand positive efforts in the equilibrium; contribution levels and the outcome of the contest game are independent of the number of players; and contributions do not depend on the distribution of the valuations in the group, but only on the highest valuation in each group. Finally, the third part of the project uses laboratory experiments to investigate the efficiency and potentially wasteful efforts of several alternative contests: four simultaneous and three sequential contests. The simultaneous contests include a grand contest, two multiple prize settings (equal and unequal prizes), and a contest which consist of two subcontests. The sequential contests are a sequential elimination contest, a two-stage tree contest, and a two-stage tree contest with carryovers. Alternative theoretical and behavioral models such as inequality-averse theory and quantal response equilibrium are used to explain subjects' deviations from the theoretical predictions"
19274,NSF,HHS,"Systemic acquired resistance is an immune response in plants that confers long-lasting resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens. It is controlled by NPR1 and SNI1, which serve as the  on  and  off  switches for expression of proteins with antimicrobial activities, respectively. Pathogen infection also triggers an increase in DNA recombination to generate new traits for better adaptation to the selective pressure. The investigators of this project identified several additional proteins affecting both antimicrobial gene expression and DNA recombination and showed that they physically interact with SNI1. Through this project, these investigators will apply molecular genetic and genomic approaches to study the SNI1 protein complex and elucidate how this complex regulates both gene transcription and DNA recombination during plant immune responses. This project pushes the boundaries between studies of plant defense-related gene expression and chromosome structure and function in all higher organisms. For example, one of the proteins of interest is BRCA2, which is associated with familial breast cancer in humans. But the molecular function of BRCA2 is not well known.  Studies of BRCA2 function in plant defense may shed new light on how this protein functions in general. The success of this project will also have a significant impact on agriculture in controlling crop disease and benefit the efforts to project the environment.  The broader impacts of this project also include excellent training opportunities for postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students in molecular genetics and genomics.  It will allow the principle investigator of the project to continue serving as a mentor in a program for minority undergraduate summer research and a panelist in the University Women in Science and Engineering program."

These applications, among them financialmathematics, telecommunications, risk measure analysis, dynamicalqueuing systems, and green-house gas emissions, are key to attractingyoung talent towards stochastic analysis, which is an area that hasbeen rewarded with a number of major mathematical prizes in the pasttwo years. Some of the technical issues arising from the problemsstudied here are: analysis of very heavy tailed distributions;stochastic partial differential equations; multiscale asymptoticapproximations for jump processes; convex analysis for set-valuedfunctions; limit theorems for time-changed Poisson process models ofMarkovian service networks.  Tools of stochastic analysis are becomingcrucial for a core applied mathematics training, and this RTG aims totrain a number of the future trainers, as well as practitioners of theskills, with rigorous foundations in this area.Expertise in probability, the mathematics of uncertainty, is in greatdemand in the US: university mathematics departments and appliedmathematics programs, operation and risk management, financialregulatory and public policy offices, bio-engineering, and thetelecommunications industry. The initiatives of this project aredesigned to attract talented US students to graduate degrees, as wellas postdoc positions and beyond. The RTG's educational emphasis onmathematical methodology means that we will train people with broadlyapplicable technical skills that may later be applied in vastlydifferent contexts as demands and trends in the workplace evolve. Infinancial markets, for example, poor regulation and a lack ofunderstanding of the risks involved, have contributed to wide-rangingcrises, such as that triggered by the subprime mortgage debacle inSummer 2007, threatening more and more retirement and endowment fundsand public savings every day. We need to stop this run-away train. Anultimate goal of this project is to contribute to this effort bydeveloping new tools and strategies to educate the future scientists,policy makers and regulators, and potential investors about the risksand the mathematical language for their description and control. Byfocusing on forms of risk which have traditionally remained off theradar screen of educators and practitioners, e.g. operational risk, wewill raise the level of awareness and make sound controls possible."
19301,NSF,HHS,"This U.S- Argentina award will support one junior scientist and one graduate student, under the direction of Dr. Maureen Feineman of Penn State University, on two planning visits to Argentina.  The first visit will take place in February 2008 and the second in February 2009.  The primary goal of these visits is to initiate a long-term collaboration between researchers at Penn State University and Servicio Geológico y Minero Argentino (SEGEMAR) in Argentina.  In this collaboration, Penn State will provide detailed geochemical analysis to locally-based ongoing field work at Maipo Volcanic Complex which is situated in an active part of the Southern Volcanic Zone in the Andes.  The team will meet with Dr. Patricia Sruoga, a geologist with SEGEMAR who has extensive field experience in this region and is the first author of the of the most complete geochemical assessment of Maipo to date.  During these two visits, the researchers will familiarize themselves with the geography and geology of the area, collect samples for preliminary geochemical work, and develop a strategy for future collaborations between the two institutions.  The investigators plan to develop a collaborative proposal in Petrology and Geochemistry. The visit will involve a very-talented early-career PI and one graduate student.  It has the potential to generate a series of future studies regarding the processes of magma recharge, storage, and evolution beneath Maipo Volcanic Complex and will further our understanding of what triggers the occasional violent eruption in a volcano that has a relatively quiescent volcanic history."

The proposed REU site will engage undergraduate students in cutting-edge research in fluid mechanics with projects implementing both computational and experimental analysis tools.  This topic of study is an ideal choice for a cross-disciplinary program because fluid dynamics is highly relevant to a wide array of research areas in engineering.  Ten faculty will participate as research mentors. These faculty mentors represent the departments of Aerospace Engineering & Mechanics, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Construction and Environmental Engineering and Chemical & Biological Engineering.  The program will include seminars on defining the experimental method, lab safety, ethical conduct in reporting data, discussion of error analysis and how to formulate a research plan.  To enhance the hands-on research experience, a variety of professional development activities have been incorporated in the program.  These include: 1) technical report writing; 2) oral presentations; 3) the application process for graduate school and preparation for taking the GRE.  In addition, students will participate in several field trips including a tour to the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), the most advanced and largest complex of flight simulation test facilities in the world.  This program incorporates and aggressive recruitment plan for attracting 50% female and other underrepresented groups as students into the program.  It is the goal of this REU to expose students to a diversity of research areas, while providing a venue where students can disseminate their results and interact with other professionals in an enriching environment. One of the primary objectives of the program is that students attend and present an abstract (oral or poster) at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS DFD) annual conference held each year in November.

19328,NSF,HHS,"This project is concerned with the mechanism of ballistospore discharge in the Agaricomycetes, or mushroom-forming fungi, and, more specifically, with the ways in which the process is adapted to control launch speed and range.  The mechanism involves the rapid motion of a fluid droplet over the spore surface and is powered by surface tension, a mechanism that can also drive man-made nanoscale machines.  Subtle modifications in spore morphology have profound effects upon spore motion, suggesting that the varied forms of spores may reflect adaptation to specific selective pressures.  There are three specific experimental aims.  Aim 1 will identify adaptations to the ballistosporic mechanism that control launch speed and range in gilled, spined, and poroid mushrooms.  Experiments will involve high speed video microscopy, mathematical modeling, and electron microscopy.  The same methods will be used in Aim 2 to examine adaptations to the ballistosporic mechanism that control launch speed and range in discoid, flattened, and coral-shaped fruiting bodies.  Aim 3 concerns changes in spore morphology and development associated with the loss of the ballistosporic mechanism in some species of mushroom-forming fungi.  The project involves active collaboration with other faculty scientists in different disciplines, and work with graduate and undergraduate students.  The training of undergraduate students from the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati through summer research experiences at Miami University is particularly important in terms of the broader impact of the project.  A second mechanism for broadening the impact of the research involves student participation through the P.I.'s course in mycology.  This class provides diverse students, including non-science majors, with a unique opportunity to participate in a single-semester research project designed to lead to significant and potentially publishable results."
19347,NSF,HHS,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the critical problems of tracking and monitoring firefighters or other first responders inside structures. Whereas many available systems such as GPS fail indoors or require an overwhelming number of access points to obtain accurate information, our system requires only a base station that can be quickly set up at a command post outside (or inside) a building and small devices worn by the responders. Our system sets up a mesh network to communicate data amongst responders, as well as between the responders and the command post base station(s). The mesh network extends the range of the base station by allowing data to be relayed through another team member if a responder goes out of range. Our prototype system has been demonstrated to provide accurate tracking and location of personnel performing simple motions in complex structures from a base station outside of the structure. This project will focus on improving tracking algorithms such that complex motions can be recognized and accurately tracked. The expected outcome of the project is a much improved interface between the typical command center and the first responders.The initial market impacted by this project development is firefighter location and monitoring. Firefighting is one of the most dangerous jobs in the US. An average of 95 firefighters have been lost every year over the past decade. Some of these deaths could have been prevented if only the firefighter's distressed condition and exact position were known. No commercial technology currently exists that pinpoints the location of a downed firefighter. Critical time can be wasted before a downed firefighter is even first detected. Subsequently, critical resources are often diverted in frantic searches in hazardous conditions and extremely poor visibility. The seconds saved by knowledge of firefighter alarms and their positions could mean the difference between minor and severe injuries or death."
19359,NSF,HHS,"English in Appalachia has received little empirical scholarly attention, despite being one of the United State's most widely-recognized vernaculars.  Over the last eight years, Dr. Kirk Hazen and associates of the West Virginia Dialect Project have conducted 151 interviews with native Appalachians. From this subject pool the West Virginia Corpus of English in Appalachia (WVCEA) was created. This corpus of 67 speakers balanced by age, sex, and region will be used to develop a sociolinguistic baseline for English in Appalachia. The primary goal for the overall project is to conduct quantitative sociolinguistic analysis on English in West Virginia to determine its current status, including its regional affiliations, its relative degree of vernacularity, its sociolinguistic divisions, and current directions of change. Another goal of this proposal is to develop a clearer regional association for English in West Virginia. Native West Virginians consider the language in the northern half of West Virginia to be far different from language in the southern region, which is aligned more with Southern varieties. A solid foundation of sociolinguistic evidence is needed to explore these claims. This project integrates research and education by advancing discovery and understanding for university students while at the same time promoting better language awareness for the general public and teachers in K-12 schools through Dialect Awareness Programs. This research will contribute to the public understanding of language diversity in American society, especially the role of Appalachia within that society."

The iPC is fluid and dynamic, utilizing new computer, computational science and cyberinfrastructure solutions to address an evolving array of grand challenges in the plant sciences.  It is community-driven, involving plant biologists, computer and information scientists and engineers, as well as experts from other disciplines, all working in integrated teams. The iPC brings together strengths in plant biology, bioinformatics, statistics, computer science and high throughput computing, as well as innovative approaches to education, outreach, and the study of social networks.Several key principles guided the development of the iPC.  Specifically, the iPC:? is a cyberinfrastructure collaborative rather than purely a cyberinfrastructure,? will enable multi-disciplinary teams to address grand challenges in plant science,? will be an entity that is by, for and of the community,? will train the next generation in computational thinking, and? is designed to be able to reinvent itself as needs and technologies change.The driving force behind the iPC is the nature of the grand challenge questions in plant sciences, and all facets of the collaborative are organized around those selected questions.  The act of selecting these questions will be community-driven, and to facilitate that, the Collaborative will host a series of workshops, each focused on a specific area of plant biology, but with participants cutting across the spectrum of the computational and biological sciences.  The goal of each workshop will be to identify the grand challenge questions in that field, as well as the necessary strategies and approaches that will be needed to solve the question(s). Self-forming Grand Challenge Teams from the community will then work with iPC personnel to develop a ?Discovery Environment? (DE), which will be a cyberinfrastructure for open-access research and education focused on a grand challenge question.  Over time, the DEs designed for different grand challenges will overlap and coalesce into a comprehensive cyberinfrastructure for discovery and learning.The cyberinfrastructure created by the iPC will provide the community with two main capabilities: it will provide access to world-class physical infrastructure ? for example persistent storage, and compute power via local and national resources, and it will provide services that promote interactions, communications and collaborations and that advance the understanding and use of computational thinking in plant biology. Through these capabilities, the iPC will catalyze progress in targeted areas of plant biology, and more broadly advance the whole of plant science through new, creative, synthesis activities, and training the next generation of scientists in computational (and collaborative) thinking.The broader impacts of the iPC project will not be limited merely to creating the tools for solution of currently intractable grand challenge questions, because at its core the iPC is actually a community building and educational enterprise designed to facilitate education and outreach. Grand Challenge teams and iPC staff will work together to educate students (K-12, undergraduate, and graduate, including members of underrepresented groups) through the use and development of Discovery Environments. Thus, education and outreach efforts will permeate the iPlant Collaborative."

19469,NSF,NSF,"New general high-performance computing platforms simultaneously run multiple programs and a large number of threads. This presents unprecedented challenges for code optimization. First, the ubiquitous existence of multi-program and multi-thread makes a program run in an environment that has extensive resource competition. Second, the execution environment, which is the target of code optimization, is always changing during the life of a program. This project employs a systematic approach of optimization and runtime adaptation for multiple runtime contexts - Context-aware and Context-adaptive Optimization (CACAO). CACAO exploits both computer architectural features and runtime contexts in program optimizations and integrates four synergistic approaches: (1) Runtime environment characterization, which characterizes contexts in which a program will execute and augments compiler models with context; (2) New profiling techniques, which report both program performance and context information; (3) Context aware code optimization, which uses profiling information to identify and predict contexts, optimizes programs for different contexts, and integrates contextualized versions of a program; and (4) Dynamic code adaptation, which adapts programs at runtime by selecting the most suitable version of a program for the current context. The project directly leads to more effective compilation and code generation in all domains, thus bringing broad benefits to society, in particular for people who require the computation power from the new general high-performance computers. The project is expected to provide new code optimization techniques that accelerate programs in the new high-performance computers. The optimization techniques and resources will be disseminated as open-source software tools and packages."

Mechanisms for trust management and privacy protection are integral to the future success of online social networks. A trustworthy social network should allow users to flexibly control who can access their social information and to what extend. Online social networks also broaden the scope and scale of social science. Privacy issues arise naturally when the data of online social networks are shared for research and other purposes. This project develops theoretical and practical techniques for the management of trust and privacy for online social networks. One central goal is to look into the future of online social networks and develop techniques that are not only suitable for today?s social networks but for the future open computing platform built on top of them. In particular, this project focuses on flexible trust models for social networks, privacy preserving feedback issuing and management, and graph anonymization for the sharing of social network data. The developed techniques directly help the secure development and deployment of a wide range of new types of services that are well beyond the realm of traditional online services.

19528,NSF,HHS,"CAREER: Collaborative Optimization with Limited Information DisclosureWith the rapid increase in computing, storage and networking resources, data is not only collected and stored but also analyzed. This creates a serious privacy problem which often inhibits the use of this data. This project explores the problem of performing optimization analysis over distributed data without conflicting with privacy and security concerns. This is especially challenging due to the complexity and iterative nature of the solutions. An inherent aim is to also solve some of the fundamental problems underlying privacy-preserving analysis / secure computation and make it more accessible and applicable. Some of the innovative expected results include: (1) novel formulations of security definitions that are more relaxed than the traditional definitions yet still model the real security concerns; (2) new algorithms, computational complexity results, and tools for specific widely used optimization problems; (3) a more generalized view of privacy; (4) game theoretic interpretations and modeling of the multi-party computation; and (5) result analysis ? a quantification of privacy loss through results. The project will have tremendous broader impact via fundamental research and integrative education. Direct outcomes of the research can significantly help in widening co-operation between organizations and minimize loss through data isolation. This would result in cost savings and new income realization potentially worth billions of dollars through joint resource usage. Translation of the research to real use has the potential to revolutionize the mediator/consolidator industry.

19539,NSF,NSF,"Wireless networks, by virtue of their untethered nature, ease of set-up, and mobility support, have been heartily welcomed into our daily work and lives. Crucial to the continuing success and even wider deployment of wireless networks is automatic management of these networks. The goal of this research is to investigate two fundamental questions of fault management in wireless networks: (1) What are suitable management architectures and what data/measurements need to be collected for effective management? (2) What are suitable techniques for fault management? To be focused, this research mainly investigates two ?extreme? forms of wireless networks -- wireless LANs (WLANs) and sensor networks. More specifically, it proposes a novel management architecture and develops a series of fault management techniques for WLANs. It also develops a suite of diagnostic tools for static and mobile sensor networks, respectively. The techniques for the various management tasks utilize statistical analysis, optimization, stochastic modeling, and machine learning techniques, and will be evaluated using a combination of analysis, simulation and experiments. Although necessarily focused on a subspace in the large realm of wireless network management, by synthesizing lessons learned from this subspace, this project aims to provide insights into wireless network management in general.The outcome of this project will greatly advance the state of the art in wireless network management, potentially impacting many aspects of our daily lives.

These ligands are designed to stabilize high oxidation state, early transition metals.  The under-explored NACM catalysis reactions will examine the trans-influence of the pincer ligands on M-N multiple bonds, particularly in stoichiometric and catalytic exchange reactions.  This research will lead to new methods for weakening M-N bonds, which are often too stable for NACM to work efficiently.  The synthesis of alkyne/nitrile complexes may have broad applicability as a tool in directed organic synthesis as the catalysts could find offer more environmentally-friendly methods of synthesis for both the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  In addition to training undergraduate and graduate students in research techniques, the Professor Veige hopes to inspire wide audiences to develop an interest in research through  Chemistry Day at the Mall  outreach activities.  These activities will encourage scientists to see outreach to the public as an expected part of their professional career while encouraging younger students to consider scientific careers."
19595,NSF,HHS,"One of the most compelling applications of determining evolutionary relationships is to explain the evolution of complex behaviors. Spider wasps exhibit a variety of behaviors associated with nesting for which evolutionary scenarios have been postulated in the past, but never tested. Specific objectives of this project are to reconstruct and revise the higher-level classification of spider wasps, to propose new scenarios for how nesting behaviors may have evolved, and to maintain a website that organizes information on the project. Evolutionary relationships and relatedness will be estimated from morphological, behavioral, and molecular data. The results are likely to challenge existing paradigms concerning the evolution of social behaviors in general, as well as wasp nesting specifically, which will likely lend scientific rigor to, or revise, information presented in college textbooks. This study also is important because it will train undergraduate and graduate students in morphological and molecular methods, and will help transfer taxonomic information from a retired expert to younger generations of systematists.  The project will also result in products that will be accessible to non-experts.  The interactive keys produced will enable non-experts to identify spider wasps, while the website will be approachable to non-experts and will be a useful teaching tool from the high school to professional levels"
19624,NSF,HHS,"The 181 AD eruption of Taupo caldera was the most powerful eruption globally in at least the last 5000 years. Despite the great inertia associated with these exceptionally high eruption rates, Taupo was characterized by repeated abrupt changes in the form and power of the eruptions. Such abrupt shifts in eruptive intensity are a fundamental, yet little studied, part of many intense explosive eruptions. The causes of such shifts remain poorly understood, at a time when our models for steady state eruptive processes at volcanoes become increasingly elegant and sophisticated. The quality of hazard advice and eruption forecasts would be significantly improved if such changes could be explained, and even anticipated. The main goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms for, and origin of, such 'unsteadiness' with a long-term aim to improve preparedness for future eruptions at large volcanoes. The research plan is fourfold: a) to quantify changes in eruption intensity on a scale finer than previously described at Taupo, or for any other powerful silicic explosive eruption and constrain vent position precisely for all 7 eruptive phases/units; b) record the vesicularity (and crystallinity) of samples that span both the first order transitions in style, between units, and second order shifts in intensity; c) measure pre- and syn-eruptive volatile content of the same samples; and d) refine existing degassing, ascent and eruption models for powerful silicic eruptions with emphasis on explaining abrupt shifts in eruption processes. This project will bring together 5 students and researchers from 4 international institutions and 4 four sub-disciplines in volcanology."
19672,NSF,HHS,"Biological Sciences (61)Despite its increasing importance, there is a general lack of integration of bioinformatics concepts into the undergraduate curriculum in the life sciences and related disciplines where they could be readily applied. This project is addressing this problem through development, pilot testing and dissemination of a set of modules in bioinformatics that can be integrated into curricula in the biological sciences, computer science and other disciplines. Each module consists of approximately five hours of instruction with a problem-based learning component and illustrative homework assignment and addresses a fundamental concept in bioinformatics (e.g., algorithms, databases, etc.). At the University of Nebraska at Omaha approximately three hundred biology and computer science undergraduate students per year are directly impacted by this project. Through workshops at state-wide meetings and availability of the modules online, educators throughout the state and nation are being afforded the opportunity to integrate the modules into their curricula. The project team includes faculty experts in biology, computer science and bioinformatics who have been investigators on National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation projects and are receiving additional university support. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the desire of the investigators to keep offerings in undergraduate education current with new developments in the field by developing, testing and refining new undergraduate curriculum materials that integrate bioinformatics concepts into other disciplines, especially biology, where currently few exist. The course modules developed for this project are instructionally flexible and can be integrated into many courses in several disciplines.  As part of a formal evaluation process, the investigators are eliciting feedback on the content of the modules from other undergraduate bioinformatics programs, as well as undertaking pilot and field-testing efforts.The broader impacts of this project lie in the broad dissemination plan adopted. The results of the project are being made available on a dedicated web site to be submitted as a resource to both the National Science Digital Library and the NSDL Pathway for Biological Science Education. Dissemination is also taking place at state and regional conferences of undergraduate educators in biological sciences, and nationally through articles in relevant scientific and educational journals such as Cell Biology Education and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education."
19678,NSF,HHS,"This is funding to support a workshop of approximately 30 graduate students and recent graduates from master's and doctoral programs in diverse communities (including computer science, engineering, psychology, cognitive science, and communications), along with distinguished research faculty.  The event will take place on Wednesday, March 12, 2008, in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, immediately preceding the Third Annual Human Robot Interaction Conference (HRI 2008) to be held March 13-15, which is sponsored by ACM and cosponsored by IEEE.  This workshop is designed to complement the conference by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of human-robot interaction to present their current research before peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference.  Student and faculty participants will talk about the important upcoming issues in the field, encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries.  The workshop will include three types of sessions: student presentations, breakout sessions, and group presentations.  Participants will hear short presentations on current research from 12 selected participants, with time allotted for questions and discussion after each of these talks.  Breakout sessions will divide the participants into 2-4 groups to discuss a focused question on common research themes posed by the organizers.  The theme of HRI 2008 is  Living with Robots,  which highlights the recent trend toward developing a new generation of robots capable of operating in human-centered environments, interacting with people, and participating in/assisting with their daily lives.  The morning session of the workshop will pose questions related to conference-oriented themes (e.g., assistive robotics, awareness and monitoring of humans, long term interaction).  The afternoon breakout session will involve a small group project in which participants must work together to address some facet of HRI in a given domain/application (e.g., design parameters, methods and techniques, relevant technologies).  Following a keynote address from a distinguished researcher in the field, the group presentation session will provide each breakout group with the opportunity to present a summary to the entire workshop.  Broader Impacts:  This workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities (e.g., computer science and engineering, psychology, robotics, human factors and ergonomics, and human-computer interaction). This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming year. Workshop organizers will act aggressively to recruit young researchers from minority and underrepresented groups in order to assure that the participants constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, so that the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field."
19692,NSF,HHS,"Roger Loring of Cornell University is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research to develop methods for classical and semi-classical simulations of spectroscopic systems. The PI is developing and testing semiclassical approximations to quantum time-propagation that are specifically designed for the calculation of nonlinear response functions. In a second project, he and his group are extending methods that are currently applicable on larger scales to atomistic models of specific proteins. A third project involves collaboration with scanning probe microscopists who are investigating molecular structure and dynamics of disordered polymer films on longer length and time scales in order to better understand friction in these systems.A detailed knowledge of molecular motions is essential to understanding, predicting, and even controlling chemical, biological, and transport processes.  A theme in this project is the development of new techniques for measuring molecular dynamics over an increasing range of length and time scales.  The work is expected to have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental molecular processes in biology and materials science."
19700,NSF,NSF,"0752709ErlandsonThe Enabling Technologies Laboratory (ETL) Student Design Program provides Wayne State University's undergraduate engineering students with the opportunity to design and create prototypes, custom designed devices, software and services to aid persons with disabilities. Students conduct their design activities in an environment that not only complements and integrates their previous academic experiences, but also naturally integrates research, education, and community service. The student design projects are coordinated with ETL research on the impact and effectiveness of technologies that enhance human performance, both physically and cognitively, with an emphasis on the needs of individuals with disabilities. Accessible and universal design principles are key elements in these research and design activities. Based on discussions with ETL?s community clients, the major areas of need and concern deal with design to support work and vocational training and education. Two ETL clients are working on micro-enterprises focused on helping individuals with disabilities set up their own businesses. Micro-enterprise for individuals with disabilities is a new area of application for the ETL student design program. While this next period will primarily target work activities, such a focus will not preclude other application areas; however, because of the work and vocational concerns, most of the project ideas presented for this proposal fall within these areas. Our community partners have presented a long list of projects. These projects include: sorting and packaging systems, switch accessible mechatronic devices, e.g., a press for custom paper making, and a heat sealing system; smart fixtures and workstations wherein sensors provide feedback for error-proofing, quality control, and prompting for assembly, sorting, and packaging jobs; and cognitive aids for individuals with cognitive disabilities. These cognitive aids will use RFID tag systems for commercial laundry sorting tasks, stocking and inventory control jobs, and manipulatives for pre-vocational training utilizing sequential tasks. The RFID tag systems and smart sensor systems will also make use of wireless communication technology to create supportive work environments for workers with cognitive disabilities, for example, an environment that will support a team of janitorial workers with cognitive disabilities at a community worksite.  In addition to the research experience the ETL students receive, the ETL students provide a significant community service by delivering needed technology to people with disabilities while concurrently educating our community partners about the laws which mandate accessibility and the power of enabling and assistive technology to change people?s lives."
19705,NSF,NSF,"AbstractThe objective of this research is to develop a fundamentally new technique for building biocompatible microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  The approach is to use soft biomaterials such as hydrogels (for which host compatibility has been widely studied) as the basis material for building MEMS components in advanced devices.  Implantable devices have a wide range of medical use, but one of the most persistent challenges with conventional MEMS materials has been to resist biofouling.  Intellectual merit: This research aims to develop a new coherent strategy for using biomaterials as the basis material for constructing MEMS devices.  This research proposal is innovative in developing new techniques in multi-cycle fabrication of spatially complex microstructures, interfacing of multiple 3D hydrogel components, and construction of cell-encapsulated microdevices.Broader impact: This project will achieve broader impact at Columbia University, the New York City area, and broader society through three mechanisms. 1) A new undergraduate course at Columbia University on bioMEMS will be developed.  2) The latest MEMS research will be incorporated into educational modules for underrepresented K-12 students from New York City, and for New York high-school students through a teacher education program.  3) Translation of MEMS research into medical products that will benefit society will be promoted by fostering interactions between industrial researchers and undergraduate students.  Also, MEMS research projects will be incorporated into international collaborations, including those with researchers from Asia and Africa."
19709,NSF,NSF,"This SBIR Phase II project extends the PI's Phase I to create a theoretical bandwidth and latency efficient multimedia streaming framework for communication. The ultimate goal is a software system that achieves less than 150 msec one-way end-to-end delay (the typical delay of telephone) for a 10-30 site meeting supporting wideband audio, full motion video, and application/desktop sharing over broadband networks.  The industry norm to achieve multiparty video/web conferencing is the client-server architecture.  Client-server architecture is expensive to deploy due to the number of servers required and the bandwidth required at the server nodes. Peer-to-peer approaches have been successfully used for large scale file sharing. However, peer-to-peer approaches have been relatively unexplored to scale the number of participants in a single meeting.  This research combines real-time network sensing and the domain knowledge of video and web conferencing to create a scalable and cost effective peer-to-peer streaming algorithm. The maximum number of sites in a multiparty videoconferencing is typically 4-6. Given the limited screen resolution of a laptop/desktop, methods for showing 10-30 full motion video and a shared application are relatively unexplored. Poor user experience from inadequate user interface is a major barrier to the adoption of previous video/web conferencing tools. This research combines recent human factor discoveries to create a novel user interface that intuitively supports multiparty communication.Since AT&T invented videoconferencing in 1927, videoconferencing has been one commercial failure after another. The PI's previous research suggests that such failures are rooted in inadequate knowledge of the human factor requirements of videoconferencing. Based on previous research, they are developing a commercial software system which will make substantial impact on telework, remote education, and humanitarian operations.  This project aims to create a low-cost peer-to-peer alternative to client-server architectures for large scale meetings. If successful, the architecture proposed in this effort could have significant commercial impact."
19715,NSF,HHS,"This award will support an international conference entitled       New directions in Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization . The central theme of this conference will be combinatorics and its applications in theoretical computer science and operations research. The conference will take place in May 2008 on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in midtown Atlanta, and will honor the 65th birthday of William T. Trotter.There are two main reasons for holding the conference in Atlanta, namely direct flights from most of the world's major airports, and the presence of the PhD program in Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO) at Georgia Tech, with its more than 45 affiliated faculty and 40 students.The conference program will consist of approximately 30 invited lectures, a poster session and a problem session. The conference is expected to attract 200-300 attendees, including local, regional, national and international delegates. A conference proceedings will be published as a special issue of the journal Combinatorics, Probability and Computing.The list of invited speakers includes only the leading experts and fine expositors. The organizing committee consists of experienced senior researchers who will uphold very high standards. Georgia Tech has excellent facilities to accommodate a conference of this type.Using federal support the organizers will be able to offer financial assistance to attendees with no outside funding, including students, postdoctoral associates, junior faculty, women, and underrepresented minorities, with priority given to young people and members of underrepresented groups. While the main lectures will be by invitation only, junior scientists will be able to present in the poster session and participate in the scientific discussions throughout the conference.A further aspect of broader impact is the interplay of mathematics, computer science and operations research, that is already present in the ACO program at Georgia Tech. This conference will further promote the fruitful interactions of these disciplines, drawing upon the successful experience at Georgia Tech, and in doing so will further strengthen the ACO program.The conference proceedings will be stringently refereed subject to the standards of premier combinatorics journals. Thus the conference will have lasting impact not limited to its attendees."
19737,NSF,NSF,"TURBULENCE DRIVEN HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE PROCESSES WITH HIGHLY PERMEABLE CHANNEL BEDSThe main objective of this project is to investigate the effect of spatial and temporal heterogeneity created by episodic turbulent events and coherent flows on hyporheic exchange with permeable channel beds. The fundamental challenge is the evaluation of the effect of coherent flow structures on hyporheic exchange processes and the ability to provide accurate predictions of fluid and solute influxes into and outfluxes from the hyporheic zone. This will be the first study that investigates the instantaneous flow field and will advance knowledge of the hydrodynamics as well as transport processes of hyporheic zones, which are critical to quantitatively analyze stream eco-systems. The numerical method proposed, i.e. Large-Eddy Simulation, provides impressive predictive accuracy in flows which feature pronounced periodic components and/or in which turbulence transport is dictated by the dynamics of large scale eddies as present in flows over permeable beds or around flow obstacles. This study will be the first to model explicitly the individual particles that constitute the hyporheic zone. Consequently, governing flow and transport processes are represented explicitly and can be studied in microscopic detail.Two distinct scenarios will be investigated, (a) flow over a flat gravel-type bed where hyporheic exchange is solely induced by large-scale turbulence created and induced by the texture of the bed and (b) flow over submerged and emergent boulder-type obstruction buried in a gravel-type bed, where hyporheic exchange is driven by both quasi-steady pressure gradients and large-scale coherent flow structures as a consequence of vortex shedding from the flow obstruction.  Quantification of the exchange will be accomplished by adding a tracer study to the hydrodynamic investigations, with which mass and momentum exchange can be calculated directly. Further evidence of the effect of coherent structures on hyporheic exchange will be provided by a detailed statistical analysis of the mean and instantaneous flow field especially at the interface for instance with quadrant analysis, probability density functions, etc.   The outcome of the proposed research is a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms of turbulence driven hyporheic exchange and will provide very accurate quantification of exchange rates for different conditions."

19769,NSF,NSF,"The family tree relationships and geographic history of the grape family (Vitaceae) will be investigated with a comprehensive approach that integrates data from DNA analyses, developmental studies, as well as the structural form and geographic distribution of both living and fossil representatives. Characteristics of flowers, seeds, pollen, leaves, and stems will be compared to show the similarities and differences among living and extinct fossil species.  Developmental studies on living plants will clarify how mature form is achieved in species of different genera. This information will be analyzed collectively to provide an improved understanding of the evolutionary history of grapes as well as an optimal classification of grapes and closely related genera and species.  The project has great potential to contribute to the understanding on how fossils, extant morphology and molecules can be integrated into evolutionary and biogeographic analysis.The project uses an economically and culturally significant plant family as a model for integrating many types of systematic data into one study, providing training opportunities for first-generation college students at the University of Northern Iowa, as well as students abroad during field collections.  Colleagues from Nepal and China will also be trained in appropriate molecular techniques and data analyses.  Findings from this research will be incorporated into outreach programs in place at the Florida Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Institution."
19839,NSF,HHS,"This STTR Phase II research project seeks to develop technologies needed for rehabilitation of post-stroke patients with neurological impairment. For those patients, physical therapy followed by timely examination is the cornerstone of the rehabilitation. However, not all patients receive sufficient therapy due to limited access to expert healthcare services. There is a need for a tele-rehabilitation system that can stretch the spastic/contractured joints under accurate control at a remote location and provide remote access to expert healthcare services. This Phase II research will focus on improving the technology and making it suitable for the market by improving the design of the tele-rehabilitation system for multi-purpose applications to treat/evaluate multiple joints in the arm. It will make the portable device stand-alone with built-in capabilities of passive stretching, voluntary movement exercise, and tele-assessment of joint range of motion, stiffness, spasticity, and catch displayed in an intuitive way. Finally, a clinical test of the tele-rehabilitation system on stroke survivors will be conducted. This portable and low-cost stretching device is suitable for home use, making frequent and convenient treatment accessible to a large number of patients. It can potentially have broad impact on rehabilitation of stroke and other neurological impairments. The intelligent stretching concept was developed to insure safe and effective treatment and it will also be useful in other applications dealing with human-machine interface."
19851,NSF,NSF,"Much progress has been made in the last quarter century in understanding the roles of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes in the ecology of the ocean. A good deal of this progress has been made by the application of experimental techniques to natural microbial communities in situ. However, as we learn more about the unique physiological and behavioral features of different individual species, especially of eukaryotic microbes in the ciliate and dinoflagellate clades, there is a need for traditional isolation, cultivation, and experimentation to clarify metabolic potential and ecological roles of different species. Given the widespread occurrence of mixotrophy among microbial eukaryotes, the investigators believe it is important to examine the connections between feeding, photosynthesis, and C and N cycling in particular species that are known to be quantitatively important and widely distributed globally. As a result, the investigators have developed experimental tests of hypotheses related to the use of nitrogen and carbon by planktonic ciliates to evaluate the use of dissolved inorganic (DIN) and organic nitrogen sources in four species (Strombidinopsis sp., Laboea strobila, Strombidium stylifer, and Mesodinium rubrum) whose carbon metabolisms range from strict heterotrophy to near-strict autotrophy. The investigators will also measure assimilation and growth efficiencies of these ciliates (for both C and N) and quantify the role of food and light in nitrogen excretion and internal cycling. For the three mixotrophic forms, the investigators will measure the extent of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) cycling between photosynthesis and respiration and evaluate what factors control recycling vs excretion of DIN and DIC. The experimental approach will be to use 15N and 14C isotopes as tracers and to employ a pulse/chase design to measure separately the uptake and excretion of N and C in laboratory isolates. The broader impacts of this proposal include training of graduate students and one post-doc as well as outreach to K-12 educators.  In addition, data resulting from this project will be made available through the internet as well as in publications."

The ECS will reduce the costly and time-consuming experimental testing, as well as enable the researcher to probe concepts that are difficult or infeasible to test experimentally. These developments will accelerate the development of more fuel efficient and environmentally cleaner automobiles. At the core of the ECS is a suite of advanced database technologies and computational algorithms that enable the user to easily build accurate reaction mechanisms, and quickly perform simulation studies using these mechanisms.The broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will result in cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles. Even a small gain in fuel efficiency can translate to billions of savings in fuels as well as reduced dependence on foreign oil. Less fuel consumption directly scales to reduction in emissions thus lowering of greenhouse gases while improving the human health. The ECS will be made available at no-charge for use in education and research in academia and some of the key components will be made available as an open-source to the research community to foster collaboration between researchers."
19997,NSF,NSF,"PI: Venkatesan SundaresanProposal Number: IOS-0745167Title: Patterning of the female gametophyte in ArabidopsisAbstractThe reproduction of flowering plants relies on the production of gametophytes, the haploid phase of the plant life cycle generated by the reproductive organs of the flower,  containing half the chromosome set of the parent plant.  Seed formation requires that female gametophytes called embryo sacs, be fertilized by male gametophytes which are pollen grains containing sperm cells. The mature female gametophyte or embryo sac consists of only four cell types, including two gametes ? the egg cell and central cell, resulting from the execution of a precise developmental program. This project will use the model plant Arabidopsis to study the molecular mechanisms that govern the formation of developmental pattern in the embyo sac.  An unusual mutation, eostre,  in which the embryo sac has an additional egg cell in place of another cell called a synergid cell, has been identified in Arabidopsis. Characterization of the eostre mutant shows that transcriptional regulators of the BELL and class II Knox homeodomain families, and interacting proteins of the OVATE family, regulate cell specification in the embryo sac.  Identification of specific members of these gene families that function in female gametophyte development and their possible roles in specification of cell identities in the embryo sac will be undertaken. In addition, new experimental evidence indicates that signaling by the plant hormone auxin establishes cell identity in the embryo sac.  The function of auxin in cell specification in the embryo sac will be further investigated through approaches employing genetic mutants and RNA silencing as well as cellular markers that track auxin concentrations and transport.  The proposed studies will provide an understanding of the mechanisms underlying development and function of the female gametophyte.  As the embryo sac plays a central role in seed formation, the knowledge gained from these studies has important potential applications towards the control of reproduction and increased seed production in crop plants. The project will also provide comprehensive training in genetics and molecular biology of plant reproduction for postdoctoral fellows, and research opportunities for undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, by providing valuable research experience and training for the life sciences and biotechnology professions."
