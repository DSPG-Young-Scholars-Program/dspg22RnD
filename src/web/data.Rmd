## Federal RePORTER Database
Federal RePORTER, a recently retired federally funded research and development grant database, contained a vast amount of information on federally funded R&D and was utilized by researchers and policymakers to uncover insights. Federal RePORTER data consisted of more than 1 million federally funded R&D grants from science and technology federal agencies beginning in 2000. Project information included title, funding department, funding agency, principal investigator (PI), organization, start date, and total cost. Federal RePORTER data were submitted by the individual agencies including HHS, NSF, USDA, NASA, DOD, VA, ED, and EPA.

## Abstract Wrangling  
![Wrangling Statistics](www/reporter_stats.PNG)
In total, there were 1,156,137 projects in our raw dataset. We removed 42,380 projects with a null (missing) abstract from the dataset. We associated each project with the year given in the project start date. This allowed us to associate the topics assigned to a a project to a given year as well. By looking across topics assigned to all projects, we could then track topics over time. For topics missing a start date, we used the budget start date to assign a year. Otherwise, projects were assigned a year based on the FY in which they were assigned to the Federal RePORTER database.  
We deduplicated projects that shared the same title, abstract, and start date. For example, multi-institutional projects with an entry in Federal RePORTER for each organization would be considered duplicate entries for the same project. There were 414,105 duplicate entries removed.  

## Text Data Preparation  
For the purpose of our projects, it was choosen to not remove items such as common  words (i.e. the, and, it) and non-alphabetic characters. Doc2Vec, a method we selected, takes these items into account to give documents as a whole meaning. Our other vectorization method, TF-IDF , removes terms that occur frequently while vectorizing and makes all words lowercase in this process as well.
