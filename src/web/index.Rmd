# **Research Kristian**
How can we characterize the R&D digitalization research area that the funding supported? What are trends in the digitalization research area?

# **Prior Work**
Topic modeling, term matching, and latent semantic indexing on the case study topic of pandemics.   


# **Method**  
##Literature Review   
A literature review was conducted to define digitalizaiton and explore different models that can be used to determine which abstracts pertain to it as a theme.  

##Word Vectorization  
The models of TF-IDF and Doc2Vec were used to turn a corpus of abstracts into vectors.   

###TF-IDF  

Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency is a vectorization method that represents a document as a set of vecotrized words.  

###Doc2Vec  

Doc2Vec is a different way to vectorize a document that takes into account the order words appear relative to others. It looks at the documents as a whole as opposed to individual words.  



##Text Classifiers  

The vecotrized words were put into a KNN text classifier to determine which abstracts relate to digitalization and more specifically the sub theme of big data.

  
 






<!-- Here's how you make a list: -->

<!-- *Tips for making figures look good:* -->

<!-- - Make text sizes BIG -->
<!-- - Stick to the same colors -->
<!-- - Decide to add titles, captions, etc in the figures OR add on the website for all figures -->
