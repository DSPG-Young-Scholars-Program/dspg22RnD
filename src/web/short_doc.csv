0,89996,"This is a project to explore Game-based, Metaphor Enhanced (GaME) design. GaME is a method for applying cognitive science metaphor theory toward the design of computer-mediated learning environments. The process uses structure mapping theory to design videogame worlds aligned with science concepts. This is a rigorous specification procedure for mapping relational structure from targeted concept to game world. GaME design translates a targeted concept into a game system, game play, and game goal. Because the relational structure of the game world is designed as an analog of the targeted conceptual domain, players begin to construct mental models of the targeted concept during interactive gameplay. This makes learning concrete and embodied. Gameplay experiences are designed to guide the learner to discover the relational structure of the targeted concept. This gameplay is a readiness activity for preparing the learner for subsequent instruction. The primary objective of the Cyber-Enabled Teaching and Learning through Game-based, Metaphor Enhanced Learning Objects (CyGaMEs) project is to empirically test this application of cognitive science theory. Aptly designed videogame worlds will provide common experience that prepares educators and their learners to achieve success. CyGaMEs employs cognitive science, informatic sciences, and analysis methodologies to enhance control over what games do: Engage learning through doing, discovery, and inquiry. While each player takes an idiosyncratic route, applied structure mapping theory ensures that gameplay exploration proceeds toward the learning goal.  Selene: A Lunar Creation GaME is the core of CyGaMEs research. This project will: (a) complete, refine and test existing Selene prototype, (b) collect GaME data representing perceptions and learning, (c) develop and refine new methods and metrics for assessing motivation, engagement, and achievement within instructional videogames, and (d) integrate GaME data collection and assessment within a cyber-enabled informatics infrastructure.",Achievement; analog; base; Cognitive Science; computer design; Conceptual Domain; Data; Data Collection; design; Educational process of instructing; Ensure; Environment; experience; Goals; Informatics; Instruction; Learning; Maps; Mediating; Metaphor; Methodology; Methods; Metric; Modeling; Motivation; Perception; Play; Procedures; Process; prototype; Psyche structure; Readiness; Research; Research Infrastructure; Route; Science; Structure; success; System; Testing; theories; Translating,"RUI: CYGAMES: CYBER-ENABLED TEACHING AND LEARNING THROUGH GAME-BASED, METAPHOR ENHANCED LEARNING OBJECTS",NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,8/31/2012,2008,1999467.0
1,89997,"Institution: Franklin Institute Science Museum PI: Snyder, Steve Project: ARIEL - Augmented Reality for Interpretive and Experiential Learning Proposal No.: DRL-0741659 PROJECT SUMMARY In partnership with the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education and Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center, the Franklin Institute Science Museum will develop, test, and pilot an exportable and replicable cyberlearning exhibit using two cutting edge technologies: Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). The exhibit's conceptualization is anchored in the learning research vision of the NSF-funded workshop Cyberinfrastructure for Education and Learning for the Future (Computing Research Association, 2005).  The incorporation of VR and AR technologies into the Franklin Institute's electricity and Earth science exhibits is an innovation of traditional approaches to hands-on learning and will improve the quality of the learning experience for the primary audience of families with children and elementary school groups. The project has implications for future exhibit development and more broadly, will provide new research on learning on how to incorporate cyberlearning efforts into traditional exhibits. Fifteen participating exhibit developers across the ISE field will assist in the evaluation of the new exhibit; receive training on the design and development of VR and AR exhibits for their institutions; and receive full access to the exhibit's new software for implementation at their informal learning sites.  The technology applications will be developed by Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center--leaders in the field in Virtual Reality design and development. Front-end and formative evaluation will be overseen internally by the Franklin Institute. The Institute for Learning Innovation will conduct the summative evaluation. Research will be conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education on the effects of AR and VR technologies on exhibit learning.",Active Learning; Child; Computer software; design; Development; Education; Educational workshop; Electricity; elementary school; Evaluation; Exhibits; experience; Family; Funding; Future; Hand; improved; innovation; Institutes; Institution; Learning; Museums; Pennsylvania; Research; Schools; Science; Site; Technology; Testing; Training; Universities; virtual reality; Vision,ARIEL - AUGMENTED REALITY FOR INTERPRETIVE AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,8/31/2012,2008,1799699.0
2,90002,"DRU: Integrated optimization of evacuation and sheltering for hurricanesPI: Rachel Davidson, University of Delaware (UD). Participating Institution: Cornell University.ABSTRACTThe goal of this project is to improve understanding of and decision support for evacuation and mass case sheltering in hurricanes. The task of moving tens or even hundreds of thousands of people from a wide geographic area in only a few days or hours under uncertain, dangerous conditions, getting them to safe locations, and keeping them safe until they can return home is an extraordinarily complicated process, and as Hurricane Katrina made abundantly clear, the stakes are high. Despite a lot of progress, recent events and unchecked population growth in hurricane-prone regions assure us that many challenges remain. The traditional, conservative approach of evacuating everyone thought to be at risk is no longer feasible in many areas in which there are simply too many people and too little transportation capacity. We propose a fundamentally new approach. In the past, math modeling in this application has been limited to estimating the time required to clear a region, assuming many characteristics of the problem are uncontrollable input (e.g., shelter locations). Instead, we will develop sophisticated optimization models with an expanded decision frame that focuses on higher-level objectives, such as minimizing life loss, cost, and inequity, and considers the full range of strategic and operational evacuation and sheltering strategies in meeting those objectives, including for example, vertical evacuation and strategically locating shelters. These models will be developed through a tight interaction between sociologists and engineers to ensure they are firmly grounded in the reality of people?s behavior. For the first time, the models will be based on individual hurricane scenarios instead of conservative aggregations of many events, and they will be dynamic, accounting for the fact that officials can update their decisions as an event unfolds and information about the situation changes. The project has 5 main steps: (1) determine a set of hurricane scenarios for use in evacuation and shelter models such that they appropriately represent the full range of possible events, but are few enough to allow detailed analysis with each; (2) conduct focus groups of key decisionmakers and stakeholders to identify and characterize appropriate decision objectives, constraints, assumptions, and possible evacuation and shelter management strategies; (3) using the focus group input, develop two mathematical optimization models?one long-term strategic and one short-term operational?for evacuation and sheltering decisions; (4) conduct surveys of affected citizens to ensure that the optimization model assumptions and results make sense; and (5) demonstrate the models through case studies in North Carolina and Florida. Any evacuation and sheltering planning effort is only as effective as its weakest link, so it requires a broad range of expertise from marine science, transportation engineering, risk modeling, optimization, and behavioral research collaborating closely. We have assembled this expertise on the project team.This project will help begin to transform the way hurricane evacuation and sheltering are conducted in the U.S., addressing many of the known limitations of the current approach. The new understanding and optimization models developed in this project will help local and state emergency managers better plan for hurricane evacuation and sheltering, thus reducing the deaths, injuries, and unnecessary expense associated with poorly planned or executed response in future hurricanes. By collaborating throughout the project with state and local emergency management departments and the American Red Cross, the key agencies in charge of hurricane evacuation and sheltering, we will ensure that study results are disseminated to practitioners as quickly and effectively as possible. Three graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research, each with at least two of the co-PIs on their committees to ensure tight integration. By providing a substantive example of truly interdisciplinary disaster research, the project will help facilitate the transformation of the well-known Disaster Research Center, historically based in sociology, into an interdisciplinary center. It will also help to launch the new interdisciplinary graduate program in Disaster Science and Management at the University of Delaware.",Accounting; Address; Affect; American; Area; base; Behavior; Behavioral Research; Caring; Case Study; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Charge; cost; Delaware; Disasters; Emergency Situation; Engineering; Ensure; Event; Florida; Focus Groups; Future; Geographic Locations; Goals; graduate student; Home environment; Hour; Hurricane; improved; Individual; Injury; Institution; Life; Link; Location; Marines; mathematical model; meetings; Modeling; North Carolina; novel strategies; Population Growth; Process; programs; Red Cross; Research; Research Project Grants; response; Risk; Science; Shelter facility; sociologist; Sociology; Surveys; Time; Transportation; Universities; Update,DRU: INTEGRATED OPTIMIZATION OF EVACUATION AND MASS CARE SHELTERING FOR HURRICANES,NSF,NSF,9/1/2008,8/31/2012,2008,757499.0

5,89995,"The proposed workshops will bring together a multi-disciplinary and international array of scholars studying contemporary issues of surveillance and society. In the modern era, issues of security command the attention of policymakers and the general public, both within the U.S. and beyond. Surveillance has become the key mechanism employed in both public and private sectors to contend with the uncertainty raised by threats of terrorism and other criminal activities. With the rise in surveillance apparatuses and security forces, however, public concerns have multiplied, not only about the cost and efficacy of such safeguards, but also about encroachments upon privacy, civil liberties, and public spaces. These tensions have not gone unnoticed by social scientists and humanities scholars studying surveillance.The objectives of these two three-day workshops are 1) to foster interdisciplinary dialogue on contemporary surveillance issues, 2) to map core areas of surveillance research to locate collaborative opportunities and existing research gaps, and 3) to facilitate graduate student training. The choice of participants will provide a balanced representation of both junior and senior scholars, disciplinary training, and international perspectives.

The fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a primary cause of this epidemic, and differential susceptibility among species occurring in similar environments suggests that genetics may determine how individuals respond to infection. Zamudio and Lips will combine field and laboratory studies to test whether variability in immunity genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) confer differential survivorship to this emerging infectious disease, and how the disease itself alters the genetic and demographic composition of populations following an outbreak. The proposal focuses on frog populations in Central America where chytridiomycosis lethality is prevalent; however, their findings will be applicable to amphibian populations worldwide.This project will provide a better understanding of how emerging diseases shape adaptive molecular evolution, and how variability in immunity genes contribute to the response to novel disease threats.

7,89992,"ABSTRACT: The United States over the past two decades has seen an explosion of patent awards across a wide variety of technologies, and a dramatic increase in the volume of patent litigation between rivals. Numerous commentators have suggested that the proliferation of these awards, known as  patent thickets , has had socially detrimental consequences since overlapping intellectual property rights may make it difficult for inventors to commercialize new innovations. Patent pools, which can be defined as formal or informal organizations where for-profit firms share patent rights with each other and third parties, have been proposed as a way in which firms can address these  patent thicket  problems. Patent pools have been most plentiful and well established for decades in the information technology and communications industries. In the past few years, the biomedical research community has expressed increasing interest in patent pools as a potential solution for increasingly prevalent patent licensing issues in biotechnology-related fields. This project builds on the existing work on patent pools, trying to understand how the issues faced in the biomedical industries are similar and different to the issues in information technology and communication. The project combines empirical and theoretical research in this endeavor in an academically rigorous manner. The project is deepening our understanding of a crucial  knowledge-sharing organization , an institution, like a standard-setting organizations or open source project, where firms can strategically share knowledge. BROADER IMPACTS For scientists and others interested in innovation policy, this project advances understanding of how patent thicket problems can be addressed, and the strategies that are most likely to be effective (as well as more problematic approaches). The project leaders are ensuring that the findings of the study are diffused in a variety of outreach efforts, in order to insure that the ideas can have the most impact. This takes several forms. First, the project leaders are involving practitioners as well as life scientists in the academic conference that is being organized on this topic. As in earlier projects, the project leaders are participating in the public policy process, explaining their findings. Finally, the project leaders are disseminating the ideas more broadly through outreach to the popular press.",Address; Award; Biomedical Research; Biotechnology; Communication; Communities; Diffuse; Ensure; Explosion; Industry; Information Technology; innovation; Institution; Intellectual Property; interest; Knowledge; Legal patent; Licensing; Life; Litigation; open source; outreach; Policies; Process; Property Rights; Public Policy; Research; Rights; Scientist; Solutions; symposium; Technology; United States; Work,MOD AND DAT: PATENT POOLS AND BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2011,2008,400000.0

11,90019,"Scientists, inventors, writers, and other creators have attested to the importance of inspiration in the creative process. In contrast, creativity researchers have generally dismissed the concept of inspiration, arguing that ascription of creative insight to the intervention of a supernatural source ( muse ) is outmoded myth. However, it is possible to reconcile creators' accounts of inspiration with contemporary science. Specifically, consistent with creators' accounts, inspiration is posited to be an effect of creative insight, not its cause; inspiration is posited to be a motivational state that is aroused in response to a creative insight and that compels the individual to translate the creative insight into a creative product. This perspective exposes an important gap in the research literature. Creativity researchers have made considerable progress in identifying the cognitive, neurological, and contextual origins of creative insight (thus debunking the notion of Muse) but have largely ignored the state of inspiration that promotes the translation of creative insights into creative products. This oversight is striking, because the failure to translate creative ideas into tangible products is likely to be among the most important obstacles to innovation. This project involves three primary goals. The first goal is to develop methods for the assessment of inspiration and to provide evidence of their validity. Several methods of assessment are being developed, including self-report questionnaires and objective indicators derived, for instance, from digital video of nonverbal behaviors and from electronic monitoring of the creative process. The second goal is to demonstrate that inspiration is a robust predictor of creativity and other socially valued outcomes, including work productivity and efficiency. Several types of creative activity are examined, including invention, scientific writing, and the writing of poetry. In each case, creativity is assessed objectively (e.g., receipt of patents) or through a peer-review process. The third goal is to establish the functional significance of inspiration by integrating it with contemporary theories of personality and human motivation. For instance, the personality traits that predict the creativity of an initial insight are expected to be fundamentally different from the traits that predict the tendency to become inspired to actualize the insight. In addition, mysterious aspects of the subjective experience of inspiration, such as the feeling that one is functioning as the mouthpiece of a power beyond oneself, are expected to be explained by the involvement of implicit (unconscious) processes.This project will have important impacts beyond advancing the motivation, inspiration, and creativity research literatures. For instance, the findings will be widely disseminated in the form of research articles, book chapters, and conference presentations; tools for the assessment of inspiration, known to be predictive of creativity, productivity, and efficiency, will be available for use in the workplace and in educational settings; and policy makers and others concerned with societal adaptation to changing physical and sociopolitical environments will be equipped with well-validated models of the processes through which innovative and transformative ideas are translated into concrete products and solutions.",Accounting; Alprostadil; Behavior; Book Chapters; Breathing; Cognitive; Creativeness; digital; Electronics; Employee Strikes; Environment; experience; Feeling; Goals; Human; Individual; innovation; insight; Intervention; Legal patent; Literature; Methods; Modeling; Monitor; Motivation; Neurologic; Outcome; Patient Self-Report; Peer Review; Personality; Personality Traits; Poetry; Policy Maker; Process; Productivity; Questionnaires; Research; Research Personnel; response; Science; Scientist; Solutions; Source; symposium; theories; tool; trait; Translating; Translations; transmission process; Unconscious State; Work; Workplace; Writing,MOD - INSPIRATION AS TRANSMISSION OF CREATIVE INSIGHT,NSF,NSF,1/1/2009,12/31/2011,2008,376986.0
12,89991,"This proposed project is an empirical study that falls within the contextual research strand of the REESE program.  The aim is to conduct research about STEM education relative to achievement gaps that exist between minority and disadvantaged students and their non-minority counterparts. The outcomes of this study will help in addressing the convergence of several trends that may exact increasing costs to individuals on the lower end of the gap, the economy, and to social and political ideas.   The achievement gap is a deceptively complex scientific problem that will increasingly require studying the origin and evolution of gaps from earliest childhood.  In that regard, this study will integrate research trends in the developmental sciences, the cognitive and neurosciences and economics, and education research and other strands of social science to develop interventions to address gaps in more efficient ways. The first large nationally representative longitudinal data collection will be used for this study.  This large database includes information from nine months to grade eight that will be used to test and compare the leading hypotheses about the origin and evolution of gaps.  To meet the challenge of turning such data into credible evidence that might inform intervention plans and further research, two statistical estimation strategies (growth and econometric models), information from supporting meta-analysis, and an extensive advisory network of experts will be used to conduct the study.  The research will focus on: (1) Building better theoretical and empirical research models directed toward understanding how these gaps develop from conception to school entry; (2) Identifying effective strategies and inventions that might efficiently narrow gaps prior to school entry; (3) Building better explanations about why gaps are so difficult to close during schooling; (4) formulating stronger suggestions about why gaps for some minority groups expand during schooling, while gaps for other minority students narrow; and (5) Identifying the conditions associated with significant positive changes in learning trajectories during schooling for the small proportion of minority and disadvantaged students who narrow their score differences with white advantaged students.Broader Impacts: The study is likely to advance knowledge and discovery in the field in that it brings together researchers from many fields to examine ways to better understand the achievement gap in STEM areas.  The results could benefit education stakeholders interested in improving STEM education for all students.  Potentially, this study could inform and influence current policy considerations regarding mandatory pre-school enrollment, and in that regard could be transformative.

15,90031,"[This proposal is part of a funded CRP from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition.]Can electoral institutions overcome the political consequences of social exclusion and poverty? What role did political parties play in incorporating the working classes into the electorates of European democracies? And, why are so many Americans, particularly the working and lower middle people, still alienated from participation in their countrys electoral processes? This research begins with the premise that these questions reflect different perspectives on the same political phenomenon: The context of electoral competition especially the rules governing legislative elections and their interactions with the geographic distribution income shapes the incentives of political actors to mobilize and incorporate low-income and working-class citizens. The proposed research contributes to a recommended Collaborative Research Proposal from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition. Earlier accounts of the relationship redistributive policy emphasize a stark division between multimember district (MMD) electoral rules and single-member district (SMD) rules (e.g., Iversen & Soskice 2006, Persson & Tabellini 2000). These accounts, however, miss the important modifying effect of electoral context - specifically, the geographic distribution of citizens of different types - on the effect of electoral rules in structuring legislators' policy-making incentives. The intellectual merits of this proposal lie, therefore, in the recognition that given the national context in which elections are held - in particular, the geographic distribution of income - the electoral institutions of contemporary democracies may undermine the opportunities for those societies to achieve their democratic ideals.As part of a European Science Foundation Collaborative Research Scheme (EUROCORES), the proposed research will contribute to a broadly collaborative and highly integrated project that is motivated by questions about voter turnout.

16,89972,"Eye tracking has become a widespread tool throughout the cognitive sciences and has attracted particular attention as a behavioral measurement tool for children with developmental disabilities. However, there are no standardized quantitative tools for assessing broadly defined attention skills in young children, and there is a lack of analysis techniques that would allow gaze patterns to be compared across individuals, across populations, or for a single individual across time.  This study will develop methods of quantitatively measuring attentional capacities by (1) designing a Visual Attention Assessment Suite (VAAS) which examines the interaction and impact of particular features of scenes on visual attention; (2) constructing novel computational analysis techniques for comparing gaze patterns across individuals, populations, and time; (3) validating these techniques against both standard behavioral assessment protocols and through an embodied modeling approach to ensure that our models capture the behaviorally important aspects of gaze.  The regulation of attention has been hypothesized as one of the fundamental factors affecting early development of children with autism.  This project will develop quantitative measures that can be used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators and to evaluate the effectiveness of particular treatment approaches.  This project represents the first integrated and interdisciplinary attempt to develop a much needed full-scale diagnostic instrument that operates purely through eye-tracking, computational techniques, and individual modeling.   Although our primary focus is the interpretation of gaze data with respect to autism, eye tracking is used extensively in psychology, primatology, usability studies, marketing, and human-computer interaction experiments.  The models and analysis tools constructed under this project will be equally applicable to these other domains.  This project also has the potential to produce novel methods of assessing attentional abnormalities in other developmental disorders (e.g., mental retardation, attention deficit disorder, specific learning disabilities), novel educational assessment methods of pre-kindergarten readiness, as well as to develop training methods for teaching clinicians and educators behavioral assessment using a robot as a model illustrating various attentional patterns in children with disabilities.",Affect; Attention; Attention Deficit Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Behavior assessment; behavior measurement; Child; Child Development; Cognitive Science; Computational Technique; Computer Analysis; computer human interaction; Data; design; Developmental Disabilities; developmental disease/disorder; Diagnostic; Disabled Children; Educational Assessment; Effectiveness; Ensure; Eye; gaze; Individual; instrument; kindergarten; Learning Disabilities; Marketing; Measures; Mental Retardation; Methods; Modeling; novel; Pattern; Population; prognostic indicator; Prognostic Marker; Protocols documentation; Psychology; Readiness; Regulation; research study; Robot; Robotics; skills; Teaching Method; Techniques; Time; tool; Training; usability; Visual attention,CDI-TYPE I: UNDERSTANDING REGULATION OF VISUAL ATTENTION IN AUTISM THROUGH COMPUTATIONAL AND ROBOTIC MODELING,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,3/31/2012,2008,700000.0
17,90034,"Engineering - Chemical (53)Current engineering education embraces computer-based visualizations and simulations to foster student learning. There is evidence that these technological advances, while improving student understanding of complex theories, have simultaneously led to a decrease in opportunities for students to explore forces, causal factors, and effects in the real world. The result is that diminished opportunity to physically experience produces a diminished ability to perceive among our undergraduate students. In this project, laboratory exercises are being developed to reconnect undergraduate chemical engineering students with the physical world. The new lab experiences emphasize somatic opportunities that promote physical insight and engineering judgment.

20,90041,"This study is intended to develop better understanding of why changes in reform-based practices in higher education are slow to develop.  The project aims to increase understanding of the relationship between mental models of faculty about effective pedagogy in STEM fields and the extent of consensus about such pedagogy. The research will also examine individual and institutional factors that may influence mental models and consensus and the individual and group level factors that are related to teaching practices and changes in cognitive structure and consensus over time. The study will use cognitive frameworks to explain institutional inertia and will develop methodological approaches to examine several different units of analysis using both cognitive and cultural frameworks.  The investigators will create an evaluation design that will be tested in higher education institutions.  It will describe the mental models held by individual faculty about effective pedagogy, describe the groups that have consensus on these structures, and describe how individuals and institutions vary in teaching approaches.   The study will measure changes in faculty views of pedagogical practices over time by following faculty over time.  Data will be gathered from faculty in math, life science and physical sciences over a three year period. The primary source of data will be a survey instrument given in the first and third year.

21,90042,"The study of earth's topography has fundamental impacts on society, from flood and landslide prevention and control to the understanding of climate change impacts, management of land-use practices, as well as design of roads and other man-made projects in an environmentally sustainable way.  The recent availability of high resolution (0.5 m spacing) digital topography from airborne laser swath mapping and ground-based lidar offers opportunities to develop a new class of environmental predictive models that explicitly incorporate important features of the landscape and thus enhance the accuracy of predictions. The goal of this project is to develop modern computational geometric image analysis methodologies applicable to hydrologic and eco-geomorphologic hazard prediction and control. Specifically, the project studies high-resolution, multiscale, and dynamic topography with the goal of extracting channel networks, channel banks and shapes, floodplains and hazard-relevant features such as landslide prone areas and service roads which contribute to increased sediment production and thus stream habitat deterioration.  The mathematical and computational techniques to be exploited and developed come from the area of geometric non-linear partial differential equations and energy formulations, combined with differential and computational geometry.

It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether an interpretation for the transport behavior of electrons in bismuth (Bi) nanowires when subjected to high magnetic fields is also valid for the recently observed behavior exhibited by charge carriers in bulk single crystal Bi.  The observed effects in bulk Bi have been interpreted as being due to the electrons in bulk Bi behaving like electrons constrained to moving only in a thin layer (i.e., exhibiting the fractional charge of a collective quantum state of 2 dimensional electrons).  The transport behavior in Bi nanowires has been interpreted as arising from electrons near the surface of the wire (i.e., the surface states).  However, there are similarities between the magnetic field dependent transport measurements of Bi nanowires and bulk Bi.  Low temperature electronic transport measurements in magnetic fields on bulk Bi will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal the possible contributions from surface states and fractional charge.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies.  ****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This Small Grant for Exploratory Research enhances research opportunities for minority students at a Historically Black University.  It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether surface states could explain the recently observed magneto-transport behavior in bulk Bi.  Recent experimental studies of the Nernst effect and Hall effect of bulk Bi in the quantum limit (magnetic fields larger than 9 Tesla) have been interpreted in terms of charge fractionalization, an unusual collective quantum state seen only in two-dimensional electron gases.  Absorption peaks with the same Shubnikov-deHaas period of 0.03/T have been observed in the magnetoresistance and thermopower of Bi nanowires both below and above the quantum limit of 9 T.  In this case an interpretation in terms of surface states related to a spin-orbit surface interaction was proposed. Measurements of the magnetoresistance and Hall effect of thin samples of bulk single-crystal bismuth in magnetic fields up to 45 T will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal possible contributions by surface states and fractional charge, allow evaluation of their properties such as effective masses, and permit evaluation of the relative importance of surface effects and electronic transport by bulk-like electrons and holes in bulk Bi.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies.",absorption; abstracting; Behavior; Bismuth; Charge; cold temperature; design; Electronics; Electrons; Evaluation; Exhibits; frontier; Future; Gases; Grant; Historically Black Colleges and Universities; Lead; magnetic field; Measurement; Minority; nanowire; Ocular orbit; Process; Property; quantum; Relative (related person); Research; research study; Sampling; Science; Students; Surface; Technology; two-dimensional,SGER: SURFACE AND BULK-LIKE STATES IN BISMUTH,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,3/31/2010,2008,62191.0

27,90063,"Much of the literature on technological innovation focuses on analyzing measures of the scientific, technical, or commercial productivity of specific types of innovation-related activities in isolation, and does not consider the overall productivity of the linked sequences of these activities that constitute an innovation chain, from scientific discovery through commercialization. There currently is a gap in understanding of how different types of individual innovative activities come to be linked sequentially in a chain of events that ultimately may produce new commercial products or processes. Similarly, little is known about the organizational and institutional determinants of the overall productivity of linked sequences of such innovative events over time and space. This project analyzes the economic, organizational, and institutional determinants of the probability of a successful transition between such innovative events, and ultimately, toward commercially successful innovation, at each stage along the innovation chain. Data gleaned from patents, scientific publications, literature and patent citations, licensing agreements, research funding, and collaborative agreements are being used to construct a novel database of spatial and temporal linkages between activities and entities at each stage along an innovation chain, and to develop qualitative and quantitative indicators of knowledge and technology flows within these chains of linked events. The database is being constructed using case studies of nano-electronic innovations in the semiconductor industry, and applications of biotechnology innovations in the pharmaceutical industry. This research focus is inspired by efforts within these two mature high technology industries to experiment with novel strategies to integrate emerging technologies into their innovation pipelines. The variety and breadth of organizational, institutional, and funding strategies used to coordinate innovative activities in these industries provides a rich and varied set of data to be used in developing indicators and understanding of knowledge and technology flows. Broader Impacts: Although this research focuses on the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, the analysis should also have a broader impact in the development of more generally applicable stylized facts about determinants of the innovative process. The indicators of knowledge and technology flows being constructed are available for use as data in estimation of econometric models of determinants of the probability of a given R&D project successfully transitioning to various possible types of successor projects along an innovation chain, and ultimately, resulting in commercialization. Analysis of this database using a structural model provides empirical insights into the economic, organizational and structural factors that maximize the probability of success for innovation-related projects. These insights are a significant contribution to the development of a science of science and innovation policy. Further, decision makers in both the public and private sectors should be able to use these results to help choose among different possible organizational, institutional, and funding strategies, and improve the odds of successful innovation resulting from supported projects.",Agreement; Biotechnology; Case Study; case-based; commercialization; Data; Data Set; Databases; Development; Drug Industry; Econometric Models; Economics; Emerging Technologies; Event; Funding; Glean; improved; Individual; Industry; innovation; insight; Knowledge; Legal patent; Licensing; Link; Literature; Measures; Modeling; nanoelectronics; novel; novel strategies; Policies; Private Sector; Probability; Process; Productivity; Publications; Research; research and development; research study; Science; Semiconductors; Staging; Structural Models; success; technological innovation; Technology; Time,MODELING INNOVATION CHAINS USING CASE-BASED ECONOMETRICS: NANO-ELECTRONICS AND BIOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,8/31/2012,2008,374221.0

32,90073,"Health care delivery in the U.S. is experiencing severe and worsening problems.  Costs are higher than in other countries and continue to increase, yet the overall quality of care delivered is not improving.  Increasing demand for health care as baby boomers become elderly is further straining the care delivery system.  Thus, dramatic changes are needed in health care delivery in the U.S. over the next decade.  One proposed solution is computer systems designed for health care, called health information technology (HIT).  These HIT systems, particularly electronic health records (EHR) that store patients? medical history and their interactions with physicians, promise significant improve¬ments in quality, effectiveness and productivity of care delivery.  Yet simply installing HIT without significantly changing existing work processes is unlikely to produce needed results. What is needed is an in-depth under¬standing of how HIT and process design techniques should be conceptualized and applied in health care. This project develops theories that can transform health care delivery processes in the U.S., through a deep understanding of the changes needed to make effective use of HIT and process design techniques.  The questions we address are: What capabilities does an EHR provide and which are used by health care organizations?  Which characteristics of the health care context, including characteristics of countries, the physician and nursing professions, and health care organizations, enable and inhibit the ability of health care organizations to take advantage of what EHR systems provide?  What are the dynamics of change by which EHR capabilities affect care delivery processes?  How and why do new EHR systems improve or reduce the quality and productivity of health care delivery processes?  How do health care organizations and individuals working in them need to change to make the most effective use of new EHR systems?  Answers to these questions will provide the knowledge needed to transform health care delivery processes in the U.S.This team will conduct multiple case studies of EHR implementation in health care organizations to understand the dynamics of change as the EHR implementation alters health care delivery processes.  The case studies will be carried out at our partner organizations, Fallon Clinic, UMass Memorial Health Care, Canada?s single payer system in British Columbia, and two of Israel?s four Health Fund systems.  These four settings provide different health care contexts, enabling us to observe and learn from their differences.  Improving the quality of health care delivered in the U.S. as well as reducing its cost has become a critically important societal goal.  The health care system is reaching a breaking point, and needs to be changed.  Simplistic solutions, however, will not work. Solutions require an interdisciplinary approach and the holistic, in-depth understanding of the variety of forces influencing change that will be studied in this project.

34,90075,"Goals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement award seeks to improve observational modeling and analysis of high elevation hydroclimatology by strengthening the instrumentation and modeling infrastructure. A second goal is to address a critical state problem with global significance ? understanding and forecasting the effects of climate change on water supply and water quality in arid regions. Climate changes are affecting natural environments around the world. In New Mexico, climate changes are altering processes associated with water supply, which sustains New Mexico?s economy and determines, to a large extent, the quality of life. This multidisciplinary effort will transform climate change science and policymaking in New Mexico by providing the tools required for quantitative, science-driven discussion of difficult water policy options facing the state, and will create a citizenry that is informed about climate change and its impact on natural resources.Project Major Foci: The research will address the influence of large scale atmospheric circulations on regional and local atmospheric processes and explore how hydrometeorological fluctuations propagate into changes in surface flows downstream.Given the uncertainties associated with global coupled model projections across southwestern North America, the research will examine the covariability of precipitation and land anomalies in these projections as they relate to the Southwest. Land-atmosphere feedbacks associated with snowpack at high elevation may be of first-order importance in modulating the transition from winter to summer precipitation in the current climate. Thus, characterizing and properly simulating the full seasonal hydrological cycle in regions with winter snowpack is critical for process-based analysis and for projections of stream flows in New Mexico, motivating the proposal?s focus on the upstream portion of the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico.Intellectual MeritThe impacts of climate change on New Mexico are profound and are altering processes associated with the water supply for the region. Proposed research infrastructure improvements will enable scientists to observe processes at the watershed scale and to understand the effects of climate change on water supply, water sources, and water quality in arid regions. New Mexico EPSCoR proposes to strategically invest in building a robust hydrologic infrastructure to develop a better understanding of the relationship of high elevation events to downstream water supplies. This capability is needed for meaningful forecasting and decision support. New cyberinfrastructure will support multi-scale modeling and rapid delivery of climate change data and information to scientists, educators, decision-makers, and the public.Broader ImpactsNew Mexico EPSCoR research foci are of global scientific and societal importance.

35,90081,"PI: Gurmukh (Guri) S. Johal, Purdue UniversityCo-PI: Clifford F. Weil, Purdue UniversityCo-PI: James. W. Moyer, North Carolina State UniversityCo-PI: Peter J. Balint-Kurti, North Carolina State UniversityPlant disease resistance (R) genes encode proteins that respond to pathogen invasion by triggering a rapid, localized  hypersensitive reaction  (HR), in which host tissue immediately adjacent to the site of infection undergoes programmed cell death. Although, HR is a fundamental part of the immune response in plants, very little is known about the genes that trigger, signal, execute, and then contain it. Exhaustive mutagenesis screens have been conducted in Arabidopsis, but have turned up only a few genes linked to HR, possibly because of genetic redundancy or lethality of HR mutants. An alternate and potentially huge resource of HR variation is available in natural germplasm.  If effectively tapped and delineated, this resource has the potential to advance considerably our understanding of HR . By taking advantage of a constitutive-active allele of the Rp1 gene, which confers resistance to the common rust disease of maize, we have demonstrated that the maize germplasm contains vast amounts of variation capable of impacting HR. This project will test the broad use of an innovative approach, which looks for naturally occurring alleles that suppress mutant phenotypes to rapidly detect and explore natural variation underlying HR. Using this approach, one HR-modulating locus (Hrml1) has already been identified and mapped in a preliminary test using the IBM population of maize; this QTL will be cloned.  In addition, many more QTL will be identified and characterized by broadening the screen to the 5000-line Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population currently available to the maize community. The broader impacts of the project are many-fold.  First, the approach of discovering and harnessing genetic diversity is likely to be broadly applicable to a large number of important traits in most plant species. Second, an outreach component will bring the uses of biodiversity to middle school curricula (Grades 6-8) and the topics of DNA sequence analysis and quantitative trait analysis to high school curricula, with the development and test of teaching materials that can be widely distributed.  Third, these teaching modules will be developed for and with students from a wide range of cultural, racial and educational backgrounds, and their teachers.  This approach will allow development of several versions of these modules, using different examples, different assessments and different forms of presentation so that they can be applied  effectively in a variety of settings.

38,89963,"This proposal responds to the need for realizing the potential of cyber-infrastructure for education and argues that in order for cyber-enabled learning to be realized and used, three important issues must be addressed: (a) It is critical to be able to characterize what is meant by cyber-enabled learning; (b) multiple approaches to gathering evidence of sophisticated cyber-enabled learning must be developed; and (c) learning must be attributable to participation in the identified cyber-enabled learning. The project, therefore, has three goals: (1) to characterize cyber-enabled learning using a case study; (2) to identify the assessment and psychometric issues related to assessing cyber-enabled learning; and (3) to propose methodological solutions to modeling learning in such complex learning environments. The focus of the stduy is on a substantial case study in geoscience, which employs science content that is accessible to a wide range of the education community, and which draws on known areas of research, particularly scientific visualization: the study of earthquakes, tsunamis, and related phenomena. This project asks: What is the character of analytical reasoning for geoscience within a networked, cyber-infrastructure framework, and what counts as evidence for such reasoning? What assessment and psychometric issues must be addressed? What are the methodological challenges in modeling and assessing learning within this cyber-infrastructure project? For example, how are claims of causality handled in a complex networked and nested learning environment, and what evidence would make such claims credible?

39,90090,"The Binding Principles, perhaps the most well studied principles in human language, state where in a sentence nominals (e.g., pronouns, common and proper nouns, etc.) may occur, and what they may/may not refer to. Many prominent researchers argue that these principles are part of our innate linguistic endowment because (i) they occur in the vast majority of languages for which we have data, and (ii) children in every language studied to date exhibit them at the very earliest testable ages. This argument for innateness is threatened somewhat by the existence of a handful of languages, e.g., Thai, in which the Binding Principles appear not to hold. If these principles are innate, exceptional languages like Thai should not exist.So why don't Thai speakers obey the Binding Principles? Thai children hold the answer to this puzzle: if Thai children, unlike Thai adults, exhibit knowledge of the Binding Principles at young ages, this will show that the principles are indeed part of our innate linguistic endowment, and that as children mature, they 'unlearn' these principles on the basis of adult input. However, if Thai children show no evidence of the Binding Principles at any stage in development, this will suggest that the principles are not innate. If this is the case, children acquiring other languages (e.g., English) do not have access to these innate principles, and must simply learn them on the basis of experience and other (non-linguistic) mechanisms. This project will test 80 Thai children aged 3yrs-7yrs and 20 adult Thai speakers on six experiments, each targeting a different aspect of the Binding Principles. The project will not only address one of the biggest debates in cognitive science (nature versus nurture), but it will also gather data from an understudied language, as well as establish and foster relations between academic institutions in Thailand and the United States.

40,90093,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports research and education on emergent properties of highly correlated electronic systems. The main thrust of the research undertaken here is the effort at  theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors of interacting electrons (i.e. new states of matter) as well as new regimes of parameters in which familiar states of matter behave in new and different ways. In addition, some of the research explores qualitatively the relation between the microscopic interactions between electrons and the effective parameters that control the macroscopic behavior of solids.The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work is based on an analogy between classical liquid crystals and corresponding phases of strongly interacting electrons.  Electronic liquid crystals are quantum states with behaviors intermediate between a Fermi liquid and a Wigner crystal. Examples of such states have recently been observed experimentally: the anisotropic states (quantum Hall nematics) that are seen in high mobility quantum Hall devices and the metamagnetic nematic phase that has recently been identified in Sr3Ru2O7. The more microscopic issues to be addressed involve the physics of the superconducting Tc. A number of questions are addressed theoretically.  What is it about superconductivity that causes transition temperatures, generally, to be so low, while other orders, such as ferromagnetism, frequently onset at much higher temperatures? Why is there, in the cuprate high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' doping at which Tc is maximal ? what is there an excess of in ''overdoped'' cuprates? Are there optimal mesoscale structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance the strength of the electron pairing without too strongly suppressing the superfluid stiffness? The research also seeks to interpret the importance of evidence of wide-spread mesoscale inhomogeneities in the cuprates ? both self-organized (i.e. stripes) and nucleated by disorder. The research is motivated by a need to clarify  whether these observations are complicating details or essential to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity.The effort undertaken has  broader impacts with  both scientific and educational consequences. Scientifically, there is impact in extending the understanding of the origins of high temperature superconductivity because that opens new theoretical opportunities as well as providing better ability to design materials with this highly desirable property.  Involving students and postdoctoral researchers in the diverse   problems and theoretical techniques used  provides an exceptional training for talented young people. Past students and postdoctoral researchers have gone on to university faculty positions and their own careers in teaching and research and some have found successful positions in high tech companies and a variety of other fields outside of mainstream physics.NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports research and education on exotic properties and unexplained electronic states  of unusual materials. The broad thrust of the research undertaken here is the theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors and new states of matter as well as investigating how familiar forms matter can be made to behave in new and different ways. This research explores these unusual states of matter by looking at the behavior of electrons and the microscopic level of the atoms that make up the material and then connecting those behaviors with the large scale properties which are seen in the material as a solid whole.The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work develops theories of why some materials have electrons that are not just quiescently distributed more or less uniformly but which instead group together in various patterns.The  issues to be addressed also involve the physics of the superconducting materials, those which can conduct electricity with no resistance and thus no waste of energy. The questions are quite basic.  What is it about superconductivity that causes working temperatures, generally, to be so low?

Other secondary objectives are to investigate: 1) how the response of victims is modulated by their social conditions at the time of the incident; and 2) the influence of a building?s structural system on building collapse response and occupant survival rates. Computational simulation models will be developed to represent building collapse and Agent Based Models (ABMs) will be used to model human response within the building models. Existing information will be sought in an effort to formulate basic rules that govern human response during times of extreme danger. The developed models will be calibrated and validated by comparisons to well documented events that involved building collapse. The developed models will then be used to clarify how building occupants respond during emergencies through extensive parametric simulations. The models will also be used to investigate how buildings collapse and to identify the means by which to mitigate building failure and its effects. This project will lead to the education of a new generation of researchers skilled in inter-disciplinary research.

43,90100,"SES-0817659Rachel L. EinwohnerPurdue UniversityThis study asks: Why does resistance take place in some situations but not others? What conditions facilitated the emergence of collective armed resistance? While current theories of social movement emergence argue that collective action occurs when groups of individuals have opportunity, resources, and a sense of efficacy, this study will make a contribution by examining resistance under conditions of extreme repression, limited resources, and great despair.  This research will study Jewish victims of the Holocaust who are commonly portrayed as passive individuals. Yet well known cases of Jewish resistance such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising demonstrate that in at least some places, Jews did rise up against their oppressors. Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe therefore provide a useful setting for an empirical study of the emergence of collective resistance under extreme circumstances. This project will make a contribution to the extant literature by examining an understudied context for collective action and use the results to develop new theoretical models. The investigator will conduct in-depth qualitative analysis and compare three strategically selected case studies: the Warsaw Ghetto (where collective Jewish resistance occurred), the Vilna Ghetto (where collective resistance was planned but not achieved), and the Lodz Ghetto (where collective resistance was never attempted). Data will include both primary and secondary sources, including transcripts from a random sample (N=120) of archived oral testimonies from survivors of each ghetto (40 from each ghetto). These testimonies are housed at the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation Institute. Oral testimony data will be analyzed using the qualitative software package NVivo.The study?s broader impacts are both educational and policy-related. First, the project will help contribute to extant knowledge about collective action and contentious politics in general. Although the results are intended primarily for professional academic audiences, they may also be used in other educational settings (e.g., Holocaust education in public schools). In addition, to the extent that they are disseminated more widely (e.g., through the media), the findings can also have an impact on the general public?s understanding of the Holocaust, especially by helping to dispel the myth of Jewish passivity. Lastly, the findings will have relevance to contemporary cases of resistance such as armed insurgencies, prison revolts and urban riots.",Archives; arm; California; Case Study; Computer software; Data; Education; Europe; follower of religion Jewish; Foundations; General Population; Ghetto; Holocaust; Housing; Individual; Institutes; Jews; Knowledge; Literature; Nazi; Oral; Policies; Politics; Prisons; Repression; Research; Research Personnel; Resistance; Resources; Riots; Sampling; Schools; social movement; Source; Survivors; Theoretical model; theories; Transcript; Universities,EXPLAINING COLLECTIVE ACTION UNDER EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,12/31/2010,2008,114380.0
44,90103,"In most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. The scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. This project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. Its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. This work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. It is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. Variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. Structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. From a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data.  In practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. Its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. In carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. In addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords.

45,90104,"Designing a response to global climate change requires analysis tools that can help decision makers understand the tradeoffs between the cost of a policy and its benefit in the form of avoided climate change. Both the costs and the benefits, however, are uncertain. To date, models used in studies of climate change have not represented all the critical uncertainties. One important omission is the representation of uncertainty in returns to research and development (R&D) directed to the improvement of energy technologies. Studies on R&D have shown that such returns are uncertain and highly skewed (i.e., have a small probability of a very large breakthrough). Ignoring this uncertainty and focusing on the average effect will produce biased estimates of the emissions reductions required to meet particular targets or the relative balance between near-term emissions constraints and investments in energy technology R&D.This research will improve the analysis tools available to decision makers by developing a model framework that explicitly represents the uncertainty in the returns to R&D. The representation of technical change and its relation to R&D expenditure will be calibrated to historical experience with U.S. patents. The model will also improve the representation of the uncertainty in the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions by constraining that uncertainty to a range consistent with 20th century climate. These components will be integrated into a single framework that can be used to explore decision making about emissions reductions and R&D expenditures under uncertainty.The results of this research will improve the analysis facilities that are applied to climate change assessment. The new tools are expected to give improved guidance in the timing of emissions reductions and investments in technology R&D by eliminating biases in current models.",Climate; climate change; cost; Costs and Benefits; Decision Making; design; Equilibrium; Expenditure; experience; greenhouse gases; improved; Investments; Legal patent; meetings; Modeling; Policies; Probability; Relative (related person); Research; research and development; response; Technology; Time; tool; Uncertainty,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: DRU: AN IMPROVED MODEL OF ENDOGENOUS TECHNICAL CHANGE CONSIDERING UNCERTAIN R&D RETURNS AND UNCERTAIN CLIMATE RESPONSE,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,8/31/2012,2008,442082.0
46,90105,"CBET-0838607DozierThe WATERS Network is an initiative to transform science and engineering of the water environment.  The goal is to create a national capability to better predict and manage the behavior of water-and its nutrients, contaminants, and sediments-everywhere in the U.S.  Population growth, evolving land use, and climate change make the future water environment uncertain, so prediction and management require understanding along with statistical relationships, and thereby require integration among people who study how water moves and transforms landscapes; who manage and treat water to ensure potable supplies and prevent floods; and who consider how humans, institutions, and managed systems respond to and superimpose variability on quality, scarcity, or hazard. Driving the requirement for an integrated, collaboratively developed infrastructure is the recognition that we have to predict and manage water nationwide.  Predicting Water Quality and Quantity Everywhere at All Times (WQ2EAT) requires a judicious integration of models and syn-thesis, cyberinfrastructure, education and outreach, existing networks, and remotely sensed data, along with new measurements, analyses, and experiments at a realistic number of carefully chosen sites or basins.  A network of observational and experimental facilities, where processes are studied and manipulated, will provide knowledge that can be transferred to any location on the continent.  The proposed network spans the domain of water environments-pristine, rural, and urban areas and constructed networks and facilities for management and treatment.  The capacity for prediction ranges from episodic events such as floods and storm-water overflows, through seasonal spring runoff and surges of agricultural wastes, to multi-decadal projections.The task of the investigation is to create a prototype network design that will enable detailed specification and budgeting to prepare for a conceptual design review.  The investigation will analyze existing sources of data across a domain representing the extant human-influenced water environment, conduct modeling exercises to identify new measurement needs and predict in locations where we lack intensive measurements, and scrutinize emerging technologies and different variables to observe at different scales.  Alternative observational designs, as well as experimental facilities and campaigns, will be evaluated according to their capability to support key scientific objectives. The WATERS Network will help us understand and predict the ways in which heterogeneous processes interact with one another at different scales to produce the variability found in the water environment.  Knowledge about explicitly scale-dependent processes will thereby inform options for management and engineering design. Water for human consumption, agriculture, and industrial processes is perhaps humanitys most fundamental need.  Our traditional methods of predicting and managing water and its quality are based on statistical relations developed when human impacts were isolated and climate was relatively stable.  These boundary conditions are changing, hence the need for new fundamental understanding.

While we know that humans have lived in Australia for more than 40,000 years, we do not know how speakers of the 250 currently attested languages came to live where they do today. This project uses linguistic evidence to trace the history of Aboriginal people in prehistoric times. Systematic similarities between words in these languages can be used to reconstruct various properties of prehistoric languages. These techniques will be used to determine the structure of the Pama-Nyungan language family, which will shed light on prehistoric population movements.Australia's linguistic prehistory is important for several reasons. It has been claimed that methods developed for Europe and the Americas do not work in Australia. If true, such a finding would be highly important, since these methods are based on properties of language change which until now have been assumed to be universal. However, preliminary work indicates that Australian languages show the same characteristics that we find elsewhere. Small speech community size, widespread multilingualism, and other factors have obscured relationships between these languages. These languages are an excellent laboratory for modeling what language change might have been like before the spread of agricultural communities.

They further showed that students show little gains in content understanding from textbook diagrams. The investigators will capitalize on commonalities among several theories of diagrammatic reasoning to develop four interventions, following an additive design, aimed at improving classroom instruction in how to use diagrams. In each iteration, one additional intervention feature is added to the initial intervention. In the first intervention, they will teach the components of diagrams (i.e., how to read captions, color keys, and other conventions of diagrams). In the second, they will also teach the coordinating of text and diagrams. In the third, they will also have the students engage in self-explanation.

The CSBYC has four major objectives: (1) to develop an infrastructure for a series of coordinated research investigations of the ecological, cultural, racial, and familial contexts that influence the development of African American children; (2) to provide training for early scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students around skills necessary to do research and practice with diverse populations of ethnic minority children in diverse community and school settings; (3) to cultivate collaborative relationships and partnerships between the University of Michigan and local communities to inform current and prospective practice and  intervention approaches for improving youth social and educational outcomes; (4) to serve as a resource and clearinghouse for scholarship, training, and practice approaches that can be utilized by scholarly and community stakeholders in the state more broadly, as well as among institutional and community settings nationally.  To meet these goals, CSBYC investigators will conduct an initial research study of middle school aged children in four diverse community settings. The goals of the research project are to study ways parents and family caregivers socialize their children around race and to examine the influence of various types of parenting on child academic and social outcomes. Using multiple methods (surveys, family diary studies, qualitative interviews, and observations), the research will show how parents choose parenting strategies based on characteristics of their communities (e.g., racial and economic diversity) along with their appraisals of the racial, cultural, and class dynamics of their communities. The CSBYC research will contribute to understanding of normative development of African American children within their varying family, neighborhood, and school contexts, which has received relatively little systematic attention. The study of Black youth from different social class backgrounds is important for a number of reasons.  First, despite the growing Black middle class in America, a disproportionate number of studies have focused only on low-income Black children in urban settings and/or on high-risk youth populations. Consequently, race and social class often are confounded in research and in its application to practices/interventions to enhance youth development.  There is less knowledge of family, educational, and social development processes of African American children across different social class groups and the implications of community social class and demographic diversity, such as Black families' movement to, and increasing representation in, middle class or suburban settings. For instance, studies show that parental education is one of the biggest predictors of school achievement among African American youth, yet even middle class African American students trail their European American counterparts in academic achievement. Such patterns suggest that parents of different social class backgrounds differentially negotiate the schooling process for their children. It also suggests there still is much to be learned about variation in family processes within lower and higher socioeconomic levels. By examining Black families from diverse community contexts, the CSBYC investigators will address important questions about the nature of development among Black youth in ways that can support the efforts of researchers, communities, schools, and families to encourage successful development among children and adolescents.",Academic achievement; Achievement; Action Research; Address; Adolescent; African American; American; Americas; Attention; base; Characteristics; Child; Child Rearing; Communities; community setting; Development; diaries; Economics; Education; ethnic minority population; European; Family; Family Caregiver; Family Process; Goals; graduate student; high risk; improved; Intervention; Interview; Investigation; junior high school; Knowledge; Learning; Low income; Mediation; meetings; Michigan; middle school; Movement; Nature; Neighborhoods; Outcome; Parenting behavior; Parents; Pattern; Population; Population Heterogeneity; Process; prospective; psychologic; Race; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; research study; Resources; Scholarship; School-Age Population; Schools; Series; skills; social; Social Class; Social Development; socioeconomics; Students; suburb; Survey Methodology; Training; Universities; Variant; Youth,IRADS: CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF BLACK YOUTH IN CONTEXT (CSBYC),NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2011,2008,1499901.0
53,89951,"Government policy today targets firms rather than firm ecosystems.  Given the increased fragmentation of firm activities and increased technological interdependency of these firms over the past 20 years, this mode of policy-making may be outdated.  This research leverages a natural experiment in the converging telecommunications and computing industry to examine the impact on the innovation ecosystem of removing a critical set of innovating firms. Drawing on the results, the researchers seek to define characteristics of innovation ecosystems that could provide resiliency against future shocks.Despite extensive study, there is little agreement within the academic, industrial, or policy communities on the impact of moving firm activities offshore on innovation back in the U.S.  Previous work by the P.I. has shown that moving manufacturing offshore changes technology development incentives.  Specifically, her results show that when U.S. firms shift production from the U.S. to developing East Asia, the most advanced technologies that were developed in the U.S. no longer pay.  Production characteristics are different abroad, and earlier technologies can be more cost-effective in developing country environment.  Building on these results, this project seeks to understand the impact of manufacturing offshore on (1) the innovative activities of the firms that moved manufacturing offshore, and (2) the continued advance of the advanced technologies within the same or other institutions in the U.S. In the case of the first part of the study, the results demonstrate whether firms which relocated manufacturing offshore are following a different technology trajectory from those firms still manufacturing in the U.S.  In the case of the second part of the study, the results shed insight into whether the relocation of manufacturing offshore has, in the case of the ecosystem of study, shifted the institutional locus of innovation. Broader Impact: In recent years, there has been rising concern over the ability of the U.S. to remain competitive in the global economy. Understanding how innovation ecosystems react to a set of innovating firms moving activities offshore is critical to redefining U.S. science and innovation policy and to improving the resiliency of such systems. The results of this study shed insights into the significance of institutional location -- small versus large firms, universities, or government labs -- on the quantity and direction of innovation.  Leveraging these results, the project characterizes critical metrics of innovation ecosystems that may aid in their resiliency against shocks such as a large set of innovating firms moving manufacturing offshore.  Metrics may include such units as coupling intensity between manufacturing location and innovative output, institutional fluidity, firm-university patent-publication interdependency, and other metrics that emerge from the result of the study.  These metrics can be used immediately by policy-makers to assess ecosystem resiliency, and will enable academics to build on them in future work characterizing industry ecosystems. Finally, the particular technology of study -- optoelectronics -- is critical to advance in communications, computing, and sensing.  Understanding the policy levers to continue technology development in optoelectronics may be essential to U.S. economic and military leadership.",Agreement; Back; Characteristics; Communication; Communities; cost effective; Coupling; Developing Countries; Economics; Ecosystem; Environment; Far East; fluidity; Future; Government; improved; Incentives; Industry; innovation; insight; Institution; Leadership; Legal patent; Location; Metric; Military Personnel; Natural experiment; Output; Policies; Policy Maker; Policy Making; Production; Publications; Research; Research Personnel; resilience; Science; Shock; System; Technology; technology development; Telecommunications; Universities; Work,QUANTIFYING THE RESILIENCE OF INDUSTRY INNOVATION ECOSYSTEMS: THE IMPACT OF MANUFACTURING OFFSHORE ON FIRM TECHNOLOGY TRAJECTORIES AND THE INSTITUTIONAL LOCUS OF INNOVATION,NSF,NSF,8/1/2008,7/31/2011,2008,208068.0
54,90127,"SES-0818337Meredith Kleykamp   University of KansasThe project will measure whether employers exhibit discriminatory or preferential attitudes toward military veterans and whether this affects veteran treatment in the hiring process. This study explores how and why veteran outcomes differ by race/ethnicity and gender. The main goals of the project are to: 1) identify how military veterans fare in hiring, document the extent of differential hiring treatment of veterans and whether such treatment varies by race and gender using an experimental design 2) explore the mechanisms explaining employer  treatment of veterans, how employers evaluate military experience, and what meaning military experience holds in the civilian hiring process using in-depth interviews with hiring agents and 3) adjudicate competing sociological explanations for differential veteran/nonveteran employment outcomes, of human capital development, selection, signaling or screening, and cultural capital development on the basis of the audit and interview data.  Broader ImpactsThe research has broad reaching social impacts.  First, it contributes to both the academic and practical understanding of veteran hiring practices. Findings will foster development of veteran-friendly transition and employment policies.  Evidence of discriminatory hiring practices or negative sentiments toward military job seekers would suggest the need for better employer education on laws protecting military members and better evaluation of compliance with such laws.  On the other hand, evidence of preferential treatment could clarify that employment transition difficulties facing veterans lie elsewhere in the hiring or job matching process.   The project contributes to the recent University of Kansas-Ft.

59,89942,"As team members gain experience working together, team performance improves significantly. These  learning curves  have been observed in many team settings, including software development teams, hospital surgery teams and coal-mining crews.  This research project will examine constituents of team experience in order to learn more about the specific phenomena that underlie learning curve gains. Researchers have attributed some of the performance gains associated with team longevity to the development of  transactive memory  (TM) systems, which involve awareness of who knows and does what on a team. When a team has a well-defined TMS, team members know whom to rely on for specific skills or expertise. A series of laboratory studies will manipulate the match between team members' knowledge and roles and the extent to which team members share a common language. The experiments will examine the separate and interactive effects of these variables on team performance as well as the nature of the task (e.g., its uncertainty, urgency), characteristics of team members (e.g., member diversity), and features of the work context (e.g., whether team performance occurs in a virtual or co-located setting) in order to identify which component of transactive memory (or which interactions) increases team performance.  This research has theoretical and practical implications. Due to the rapid organizational and technological changes prevalent in today's workplace, teams often do not not have the luxury of staying together for extended periods.  By unpacking the constituents of learning curve effects we learn how to promote these effects more quickly.

61,89936,"Despite evidence that innovation has become increasingly collaborative, our understanding of collaborative creativity and its impact on economic productivity remains incomplete.  For example, how should firms structure the collaborations of their inventors, given that networks which enhance the generation of a new idea also appear to hamper the dissemination of that idea?  How does knowledge flow within and between regions and how can policy makers influence those flows for maximal social welfare?  How does investment in scientific research result in peer-reviewed publication, the diffusion of knowledge, invention, and patenting, and ultimate gains in economic productivity?  These questions remain unanswered because social network data are difficult to gather, particularly across time, space, and boundaries.  This proposal allows answering these questions by calculating and posting millions of relational data, based on all co-authorship ties between inventors of U.S. patents, from 1963 through the present.The database complements the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) patent database by providing the social networks of patent co-authorships.  It creates a standard social network patent database at the individual inventor and aggregate levels including organizational, regional, and technological.  It reduces barriers to entry to scholars who lack the requisite programming skills and hardware to create the data on their own and enables real time graphing of patent co-authorship networks.  It provides a website by which actual inventors can assess the accuracy of the algorithms used to uniquely identify them in the patent database.  Finally, the project provides data on a public website accessible by scholars, business analysts, and students.  Just as the original NBER database has unleashed broad and diverse scholarship on innovation (over 500 papers cite it, according to Google Scholar, by early 2008), the social network database project will unleash a similar wave of research, focused on collaborative creativity and the social networks of inventors and their organizations.Broader Impacts: The research will publish social network data from all U.S. patent co-authorships (1963-present) for use by researchers, students, and business analysts.  It will provide real-time ability to visually illustrate these networks, with a variety of variables illustrated by color and size of the nodes and co-authorship links.  It will enable answering how managers should structure collaborative relationships and how information flows across organizational, regional, and technological boundaries.  It will enable tracing the career productivity and mobility of millions of inventors around the world.  In conjunction with other databases on research grants and scientific publication, it will illuminate the process of knowledge creation and dissemination at many levels of analysis, from the individual, to the organizational, and international.The primary purpose of this project is to make social network data, based on the co-authorship of U.S. patents from 1963 through the present, available to researchers and the public at large.  The plan, within six months of project start, is to make the data available from the Harvard MIT Data Center.  The data will also be archived in the Henry A. Murray Research Archive.

67,89925,"It is often difficult to distinguish whether the graduates of a challenging academic program are successful because of their educational experiences, or whether the program simply selected individuals destined for success into the program.  It is usually impossible to conduct a true experiment with random assignment of students to educational opportunities.  However, large-scale shifts in policy can serve as  natural experiments  that change the way students are matched to educational programs and allow us to identify causal consequences of education.The specific research question addressed by this project is:  Do institution-level shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred lead to measurable changes in graduate outcomes?for example: higher earnings, increased participation in the science and engineering workforce, or a larger probability of filing patents?relative to similar earlier graduates? And how does the research inform the science of science policy?Writing in 1994, William Trent and John Hill described a concerted effort by a group of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to expand educational opportunities in engineering, computer science and other technical fields,  to prepare their students for expanded career choices.   Preliminary evidence suggests that a shift in the relative participation of black college graduates in occupations related to engineering, math, computer science, or physical sciences (EMS) occurred at about the same time.  Furthermore, growth in EMS college majors was particularly strong among students most likely to attend HBCUs:  those who attended high school in the South.  The initial phase of this project is designed to distinguish whether the growth was driven by HBCU policies, or by change at other southern institutions.  The second phase involves assembling more than 30 years of data on the number and type of degrees conferred by each U.S. institution of higher education (collected annually by the U.S. Department of Education), analyzing the data to find other examples of large institution-level (or state-level) shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred, and combining this information with data from other sources to discover the resulting educational and economic impacts.The initial phase of this research is designed to reveal the institution-level processes underlying recent expansion of science and engineering participation by a persistently underrepresented minority group.  More generally, the research project expands knowledge about the extent to which exposure to science or engineering education at the undergraduate level changes the set of skills college graduates bring to the labor market, and whether that change is substantial enough to affect a whole host of outcome measures including earnings, occupation, and patent activity. Broader ImpactsThe knowledge gained from this research project informs individual-level career-path choices as well as educational and workforce policies.

70,89920,"The Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) project and the Educational Testing Services (ETS) have formed a partnership to construct, pilot test, re-design, validate, and disseminate five assessments of student achievement for use in upper elementary grades as growth-sensitive measures of student learning in mathematics.  The assessments are in the areas of (1) number and operations, (2) pre-algebra and algebra, and (3) geometry and measurement and are based in the literature on student's cognitive growth in these mathematical domains.  The instruments are aligned with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Focal Points and with existing  mathematics knowledge for teaching  (MKT) classroom observation instruments.  These assessments differ from existing assessments in that the questions require more complex responses than typical multiple-choice problems.  Yet, they are still machine-scoreable so they can easily be used in studies with large student samples.  Additionally, these assessment instruments enable researchers to capture student growth nested within classrooms, which provides a tool that is able to identify teacher effects on learning.  By comparing students of teachers without MSP  treatment  to students of teachers with MSP treatment in a quasi-experimental design, this research project examines the effects of teacher mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) growth on classroom instruction and student achievement.  The project expects to find that high teacher scores on the Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) measures are correlated with the size of student gains on the new assessment instruments.  Additionally, this project adds to the suite of instruments available from the LMT for exploring the connection between teacher learning, teachers' MKT, their classroom instruction, and student outcomes.",Achievement; Area; base; Cognitive; Complex; design; Educational process of instructing; Experimental Designs; Growth; Instruction; instrument; Knowledge; Learning; Literature; Mathematics; Measurement; Measures; operation; Outcome; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; response; Sampling; Services; Students; teacher; Testing; tool,CREATION AND DISSEMINATION OF UPPER-ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS ASSESSMENT MODULES,NSF,NSF,5/1/2009,4/30/2012,2008,1499746.0
71,89917,"This project examines the information seeking and using behaviors of decision makers who face decisions about their future R&D investments.   A number of trends have made these decisions more uncertain, notably  Open Innovation,  the globalization of science and technology, increasingly diverse sources of technical and scientific information, as well as the global outsourcing of research to developing economies.  There is substantial evidence that industrial decision makers lack needed information; are unaware of available information; or need a more inclusive model of appropriate decision processes.  The study sheds light on whether and why industry decision makers choose global R&D over U.S. R&D.  It does this by examining how firms that are global innovators use information about scientific and technical resources, together with other innovation-related data, to shape their investment decisions and competitive strategies.  The project is based on collaboration with the Center for Innovation Management Studies and the Industrial Research Institute (IRI), whose 250 members collectively fund and conduct about 75% of U.S. industrial research. These firms' day-to-day R&D investment decisions are transforming traditional company-owned R&D laboratories into the  Laboratory of the Future  (LOF). Each firm's own  LOF  may consist of a traditional laboratory, a collaborative laboratory, a virtual laboratory or a network of external resources, including university researchers in the U.S. or abroad, as well as government or private labs, collaborative strategic partners, or simulation tools thus augmenting or even replacing company owned physical labs. LOFs are highly likely to vary by industry and by the competitive environment of the firm. The study examines participants' discussions of these decisions and the information resources they use to decide how to build their future innovation capabilities. The project analyzes the LOF discussion to reveal how R&D managers think long-term and strategically about what they do.  The project documents information seeking and information using behavior as exhibited in an on-line discussion by the decision makers about the R&D  LOF . In addition the research opens a window into decision makers' rationales for their investment commitments.Broader Impacts: Corporate R&D executives are making decisions now that will, in the aggregate, shape the LOF and affect U.S. national innovation system. This project documents how they are making those decisions, what information they are presently using, and what kinds of data might be desirable for robust decisions. The project results inform both decision makers in industry and policy makers about data and information sources presently used, not used, and data not presently available but desirable for the future.",Affect; base; Behavior; Collaborations; Data; Decision Making; Environment; Exhibits; Face; Foundations; Funding; Future; Government; Industry; Information Resources; innovation; Investments; Laboratories; Light; member; Modeling; Outsourcing; Participant; Policy Maker; Process; Research; research and development; Research Institute; Research Personnel; Resources; Science; Shapes; simulation; Source; System; Technology; tool; trend; Universities; virtual,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH - MOD: THE R&D ''LAB'' OF THE FUTURE: FOUNDATIONS FOR MODELING THE R&D/INNOVATION PLANNING PROCESS,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2010,2008,155648.0
72,89912,"Sex is determined by genetic constitution (GSD) in most animals, such as by the sex chromosome pairs XX or XY in humans, or ZZ or ZW in birds.  In certain other animals, however, sex is determined by environmental temperature (TSD).   Among turtle species, however, examples of both types of sex determination can be found.  It remains unclear, however, how and why different sex determining mechanisms exist. This collaborative project will help fill this gap by comparing the chromosomes and sex-related genes of turtles using XX/XY, ZZ/ZW, or TSD mechanisms for sex determination.   Particularly, this research will test whether (1) all sex chromosomes in turtles derive from a common ancestral pair of non-sex chromosomes (or  autosomes ), and whether (2) the molecular evolution of genes located on turtle sex chromosomes differs from that of the same genes in TSD turtles, in which there are no sex chromosomes- i.e., whether the sequences of genes located on sex chromosomes change differently over evolutionary time than do the sequences of the same genes when they are located on autosomes.

73,89911,"This project addresses a crucial area in the globalization of science: the transmission of skills to future scientists. It does this by examining doctoral training practices critical to the transmission of skills acquired through close interaction and hands-on experience, also known as 'tacit skills.' Although an under researched area in scientific training, 'tacit skills' play a crucial role in the creativity and innovation in experimental and mathematical sciences, laser and nuclear technology development. While there is a standard set of accepted scientific principles shared by most scientists, there are also differences in terms of what is learned and how it is taught. This project focuses on Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Each of these countries has consistently exhibited high rates of innovation and productivity in recent years. However, while these countries have been successful in science education, each of them approaches the task of training scientists in various methods. The core hypothesis of the study is that student-mentor relationships significantly configure levels of scientific creativity, pioneering discoveries, technical innovation, and research productivity. The project?s main goal is to develop an empirically tested and contemporary model of science that will inform science and innovation policy about the role of 'tacit skills' in knowledge production, and to enhance best practices in U.S. graduate science training. The project analyzes the different methods using analytical, conceptual, and methodological tools from the areas of knowledge sharing, social networks, and the extended translation model of science. While a component of the project will uncover the degree of codified knowledge that is taught by most standard text books and the mastery of this knowledge, the project also seeks to understand advanced knowledge acquisition and transmission through the study of graduate science training by exploring students? relationships with mentors and peers. Contemporary research has shown that the nature of informal educational practices is not only conducive to the acquisition of 'tacit skills' but enhances professional competencies. BROADER IMPACTS: This project not only advances understanding of how 'tacit skills' are transmitted, but also informs pedagogical programs, and generates 'best practices' in advanced scientific training that recognize the changing nature and morphology of knowledge production brought about by globalization. It enhances scientific manpower and infrastructure by establishing networks of collaborations across disciplinary boundaries among scientific institutions globally.

Community of Soundscapes will employ newly developed mobile computing and collaborative mapping technology in programs that help users gain greater insights and stake into the shared environment in which they live and visit.  Sound Camera, a digital recording device outfitted with GPS mapping software, allows users to collect audio clips of their sonic experiences as they explore their cities, parks and other environments and upload them online onto a digital map through a Web 2.0 application.  They can then compose, annotate, and share soundscapes of the places where the sounds were recorded.  A Web site will be developed to expand the project?s reach to audiences not in the Boulder programs.  Professional development training will be provided for collaborators and through the Colorado Alliance for Environmental Education.  The educational goals are to promote literacy of PSS and engage the public in personally meaningful activities that benefit environmental education (cognitive goal) and expand environmental awareness (affective goal).  The project work and its evaluation processes (by Wells Resources, Inc.) are intended to advance the field of informal science education with respect to PSS and to study how these new technologies might affect shifts in the kinds of experiences various audiences prefer to have.",Affect; Affective; Award; Awareness; Cities; Clip; Cognitive; Colorado; Communities; Computer software; design; Development; Devices; digital; Education; Environment; Evaluation; experience; Goals; insight; Internet; Life; literacy; Maps; Museums; Natural History; new technology; Process; programs; Research; Resources; science education; software systems; sound; Technology; Training; Universities; Visit; web site; Work,COMMUNITY OF SOUNDSCAPES - EXPANDING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS THROUGH CAPTURE AND SHARING OF SONIC EXPERIENCES,NSF,NSF,9/1/2008,8/31/2011,2008,75000.0

79,89899,"0754379MunnThe International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Michael R. Munn to work with Dr. Peter M. Topping at Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick in the UK.The aim of this project is to work closely with Dr. Peter Topping and the Geometric Analysis group of the Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick. First, the PI aims to continue his research studying the influence of volume growth on the topology of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Second, the PI aims to study the consequences of a lower bound on Ricci curvature in the more general setting of metric measure spaces. This concept is on the forefront of research in geometric analysis and has only recently been developed. As such there are many fundamental open questions. Lastly, the PI aims to study the behavior of Ricci flow in this more general setting and determine any topological or geometric consequences for the underlying metric space. Recently, Fields Medalist Perelman has used Hamilton?s Ricci flow to solve the century old Poincare conjecture. These fields are being actively pursued by researchers within the Mathematics Institute at Warwick, most notably by Dr. Topping, thus making Warwick an ideal place for this fellowship research. Dr. Topping is a leading expert in geometric analysis and has employed the techniques of geometric flows, such as Ricci flow and mean curvature flow, with great success. Dr. Topping is one of only a few mathematicians studying e nature of Ricci flow on metric measure spaces.  An understanding of Ricci curvature and Ricci flow in metric spaces is of great importance in geometric analysis and metric geometry. These original concepts have only recently been introduced and are on the forefront of research in geometric analysis. In Perelman?s work, he did not address the Ricci flow when singularities develop and this has been an important question of Hamilton, Lott, and others. In a very recent paper, Topping and McCann introduce a notion of Ricci flow for metric spaces. These advances are of great importance as they can be used to understand the development of these singularities. The PI?s current research involves prior work of Perelman?s involving Ricci curvature. The PI also extends these results to metric measure spaces. The Mathematics Institute at Warwick is a thriving environment and is undergoing rapid expansion. The large number of resources available within the Institute make this an ideal host site.  Currently there is great interest in the development of these new ideas for Ricci flow in metric spaces and these techniques have applications across the physical sciences. The ideas related to Ricci flow are closely related to those of mean curvature flow as well as crystal flow. Understanding the development of singularities in this context is essential. In particular, singularities describe the development of flaws in crystals. A deeper understanding of the implications of this research will enable the PI to be a better professor at a university with science majors and engineers.",Address; Award; Behavior; Development; Engineering; Environment; Fellowship; Fellowship Program; Growth; Institutes; interest; International; Joints; Mathematics; Measures; Metric; Nature; Paper; physical science; professor; programs; Research; Research Personnel; research study; Resources; Science; Scientist; Site; success; Techniques; Universities; Work,INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM: RICCI CURVATURE AND METRIC MEASURE SPACES,NSF,NSF,1/1/2009,12/31/2011,2008,144400.0
80,89897,"Adaptation to the impacts of climatic change is now at the forefront of scientific inquiry and policy negotiations, but the current debate has contributed little to the understanding of the decision-making processes that shape adaptation and resilient livelihoods.  This interdisciplinary research project hypothesizes that cyclical (loop) learning enhances people's anticipatory capacity, which is reflected in more flexible and dynamic local and regional adaptation plans.  The investigators propose a resilience-enhancing approach that emphasizes an iterative way of analyzing and learning about changes and uncertainties in the past, present, and future.  By focusing explicitly on learning processes and decision-support tools, this project is expected to reverse the deterministic notion of presumably vulnerable groups as passive victims of climate change by highlighting people's skills, knowledge, strategic responses, anticipatory capacity, and agency for adaptation planning.  Research will be conducted in selected rural communities in Ghana and Tanzania using methods from the learning sciences, rural sociology, cultural geography, and participatory action research to understand how anticipatory learning (learning that helps people anticipate and adapt to change) occurs on the ground and how it can be enhanced.The contributions of this project are expected to be threefold:  (1) a theory regarding how anticipatory learning works in the context of climate change; (2) initial measures of people's individual and collective capacity for anticipation; and (3) pilot interventions for anticipatory learning tools.  The project will address new and important questions in decision theory with respect to processes that permit some communities to better adapt to change than others; relationships among social configuration, learning practices, and decision making under climatic risk; and dynamics in knowledge creation and action.  The project also will provide immediate benefits for the study populations, training opportunities in the U.S. and in Africa, and findings that have high potential impact on the pressing human impacts of climate change.  Through co-design of adaptation tools and interventions in Ghana and Tanzania, the research will foster people's capacity to influence their future through iterative planning rather than learning by shock.  The study will involve students in the U.S. in three ways:  (1) graduate and undergraduate students educated and trained through their direct participation in the conduct of this project; (2) undergraduate students enrolled in a course on climate change adaptation and study abroad in Africa; and (3) an interdisciplinary graduate seminar to design anticipatory learning tools with African colleagues.  The U.S. investigators will work closely with researchers and practitioners at African partner institutions (the University of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, the University of Ghana, and the Afram Plains Development Organization (APDO) as well as with disaster risk and development organizations (CARE International and the Red Cross/Red Crescent).

81,89892,"Abstract For nearly a century, biologists have debated whether past climate change promoted speciation in temperate zone organisms. Models of climate-driven geographic speciation were developed for many groups of temperate organisms, and a particularly detailed and explicit speciation model was developed for North American birds. Over the last decade, this paradigm for North American birds has become the topic of debate, and so a comprehensive understanding of how temperate zone birds were impacted by past environmental change events remains elusive. This project will directly test the paradigm and will significantly extend understanding of the history of the fauna of pine and oak woodlands. The work will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of diversification of North American birds in relation to past environmental change and will produce a multi-locus comparative phylogeography of pine and oak woodland birds. The project provides significant mentoring and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including many students from underrepresented groups, and gives these students a unique opportunity to work in a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research effort between a small rural university and two large urban research universities. The project also will support a workshop for high school teachers from the rural and reservation communities of western South Dakota and provide them the knowledge and resources to teach about climate change and its impact on biotic diversity in their classrooms.",abstracting; American; Arts; Birds; Climate; climate change; comparative; Educational process of instructing; Educational workshop; environmental change; Event; graduate student; high school; Indian reservation; Interdisciplinary Study; Knowledge; Mentors; Modeling; Molecular; North America; Organism; Pattern; Recording of previous events; Research; Resources; Rural; School Teachers; South Dakota; Students; Techniques; Testing; Universities; Work,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: MULTILOCUS COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY OF PINE-OAK WOODLAND BIRDS IN NORTH AMERICA,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2011,2008,149619.0

83,90201,"For the vast majority of human history, people all over the world have lived in small social groups as hunters and gatherers, and not in towns or villages. Agriculture has been claimed to be the driving force for recent population expansions: in the strongest claims, almost all current language families ultimately have their pre-industrial distribution because of agricultural expansion. While the spread of farming and languages associated with it has claimed a lot of recent attention, there has been very little corresponding work on the languages of hunter-gatherers. It is important for our overall understanding of social dynamics to analyze what drives change and spread among hunter-gatherers and determine whether such processes are different from what occurred after the farming revolution, 10,000 years ago. Researchers from the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia will collaborate on work comparing hunter-gatherer groups on three continents (North America, South America, and Australia). In North and South America, some hunter-gatherer languages have spread over large distances, but farming and associated languages have also spread widely, and in some cases farmers reverted to foraging. In Australia, the transition to farming never took place but one language family spread very widely. Results from genetics, linguistics, anthropology and archaeology will be combined to clarify what the relative contributions of migration and language shift were to language spreads. Among the linguistic data to be collected are vocabulary in the fields of plants and animals, and kinship and social organization.",Agriculture; Animals; Anthropology; Archaeology; Attention; Australia; Canada; Data; driving force; Family; farmer; Farming environment; Genetic; Human; Language; Life; Linguistics; migration; New Zealand; North America; Plants; Population; Process; Recording of previous events; Relative (related person); Research Personnel; small social group; social; social organization; South America; Vocabulary; Work,DYNAMICS OF HUNTER-GATHERER LANGUAGE CHANGE,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,12/31/2008,2008,
84,89885,"Optical flow switching has recently emerged as a promising new approach to address the exponentially growing traffic demands in optical networks. In order to realize this new paradigm for optical networks, the core network must be capable of wavelength reconfiguration and service provisioning on time scales approaching one second or faster. The present methods used in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical transmission are designed for static wavelength channels, which can increase in number over time and may be configurable to form different paths at the time of provisioning. Provisioning new wavelengths is a methodical, one at a time, step-wise process of ?turning up? the optical signal along the path, which requires minutes to hours in order to achieve the final stable state, appropriate for GMPLS networks. Furthermore, the extensive literature on optical transmission assumes this quasi-static network environment. The intellectual merit of this project will be to determine both the practical and fundamental limitations on optical flow switched networks imposed by physical layer constraints, including optical transmission in a dynamic, wavelength switching environment. This goal is particularly challenging because of the multi-layer nature of the problem. The network topology and signaling protocols will dictate physical layer transmission requirements, such as how fast the optical signal must achieve an error free condition and over what transmission distance. Likewise the physical limitations both in terms of performance and cost will motivate design choices for the architectures and protocols. In order to address the multi-layer nature of optical flow switched networks, this GOALI project is proposed as a mechanism to utilize the novel optically transparent mesh network testbed facility within Bell Laboratories to extend the network architecture activities within the NSF funded NeTS-FIND Future Optical Network Architectures program at MIT. In particular, targeted experiments will be conducted in the testbed in conjunction with the optical flow switched network optimization studies at MIT. This new testbed has recently been used to study both the power dynamics and the transmission performance of signals in reconfigurable optical networks. These two elements are essential for understanding the physical layer in a transparent switched network and this facility is unique in that it combines these in a broadband, long haul transmission configuration, typical of core networks. This university-industry collaboration will have broader impact at many levels. The problem of scaling optical networks to serve the dramatic rise in internet traffic has broad social ramifications. The project will enable cooperation between two synergistic research efforts to address this important problem: at MIT and at Bell Labs.

The prototype will be piloted to families and caretakers of deaf and hard of hearing children to study the feasibility and effectiveness of the learning technology and identify the activities that are most effective in helping deaf children learn life science at informal science centers. The project team will also compile a dictionary of science terms with the intention of including the terms in a full version of the Pictionary. The final Pictionary will be comprehensive; including scientific terms from life, physical, Earth, and space science and will be presented in animated sign language accompanied by written explanations and pictorial illustrations. The project will also produce a video guide with a description of activities that parents can implement with their children. The planning project will result in a prototype with 100 life science terms of species found at the three informal science centers the children and parents will visit to test the prototype. These informal sites are hands-on and exploratory featuring marine organisms and a range of terrestrial flora and fauna to touch and interact with. To prepare for the site visits, parents and caretakers of deaf or hard of hearing children will be taught how to use the Pictionary with children through a Flash-based movie that introduces the interactive features and assists the parents in engaging with their children in three activities using the signing scientific vocabulary. The preparatory vocabulary work with the parents and children will lay the educational foundation for the visits to the informal science education sites. Families will test the initial project prototypes with deaf children using a control group for comparison. Pre-tests will be used to assess childrens' vocabulary before use of the Pictionary. Follow up tests will test knowledge of the new words and will include field observations of children in museums, zoos, and farms, where the new terms will come to life in corresponding exhibits. The results of the ongoing evaluation will be compiled into a guide for other developers of similar materials for the deaf community, and will impact the development of the final project. The project will broaden participation of an underserved audience in STEM learning and generate new knowledge about how to effectively integrate emerging learning technologies into exhibits and programs for deaf learners.The project team includes TERC and Vcom3D and collaborators from Gallaudet University Regional Center at Northern Essex Community College, the College of the Holy Cross, and the Learning Center for Deaf Children.

The NSF-funded ITEST teacher professional development projects address this need by helping teachers effectively integrate real-world IT-based investigations into K-12 curriculum. This ITEST Study will examine the ways that ITEST teacher education projects lead to changes in classroom practice by using two teacher-role models to examine technology-based professional development and related changes in teaching practices: Teacher as Pedagogical Expert (teachers using existing technology-based curriculum with or without adaptations) and Teacher as Curriculum Developer (teachers creating new curriculum). The study will explore these two models within the context of IT teaching and learning. Specifically, we want to understand what kinds of professional development activities promote and/or influence changes in teaching practices and the integration of innovative technologies in the classroom. We will address the following research questions: 1) What are the characteristics of the two teacher-role models (curriculum developer or pedagogical expert) in teacher professional development projects that immerse participants in professional IT experiences? and 2) Does IT classroom implementation differ for teachers who have and have not completed an IT-immersion professional development experience  and does the difference (if any) vary by model?The research design includes a review of current and past ITEST professional development activities (surveys/interviews with project leaders and project artifacts), a broad survey of teacher participants from ITEST teacher education projects, and an in-depth study of a subset of ITEST teacher participants and comparison teachers to trace classroom implementation over an academic year.

94,89869,"Assessment / Research (91) Social Sciences - Other (89) Interdisciplinary (99) This project is a modest yet important expansion of an ongoing project to create a team of  Critical Advisors  to formulate a new framework for improving postsecondary resources to meet global challenges (DUE-0744106).  The immediate goal of both the predecessor project and this project is to articulate explicit and new theory by which to leverage change in institutions of higher education such that they take up and use existing evidence-based knowledge and resources for STEM education.  A longer term goal is to translate new theory for leveraging change in higher education into strategies for action that will mobilize and coordinate the efforts of STEM researchers, educators, and organizations already seeking to improve quality and access in postsecondary STEM education; and also enable and sustain the collaborative contributions of this STEM education reform community.  An ancillary goal is to successfully encourage institutions of higher education and STEM departments to rebalance their values and reward systems to more readily recognize and enable teaching as a valued professional role for current and future STEM faculty, as a form of scholarship, and as a respected career path at the K-12 level for STEM undergraduates.  This project enlarges the group of critical advisors.  During its first year of work, the earlier project discovered through careful analysis of critical knowledge and skills that it needed to enlarge the planned size of this group by 25 percent.  The combined project is now known as the  Mobilizing STEM Education for a Sustainable Future  project.  The project focuses on postsecondary institutions, which are critical in developing these capacities because they educate natural and computer scientists, mathematicians, and engineers, and also K-12 teachers, policymakers, and workers in business and industry. After they are successfully recruited, the subsequent analyses, creative thinking, and recommendations of the critical advisors will be synthesized and distributed to the STEM higher education community. The scope of work entails: (1) participation in two workshops planned and executed by the National Research Council, described in a companion grant proposal; (2) preparation for and participation in two CA meetings as part of this project; (3) synthesis of ideas and recommendations offered at the two CA meetings; and (4) preparation, presentation, and distribution of a final National Endeavor Team report that integrates the synthesis of the CA meetings with the outcomes from the NRC workshops.",Applications Grants; Businesses; career; Communities; Community Health Education; Companions; Computers; Education; Educational process of instructing; Educational workshop; Engineering; evidence base; Faculty; Future; Goals; improved; Industry; Institution; Knowledge; meetings; Outcome; Preparation; Professional Role; Recommendation; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Resources; Rewards; Scholarship; Scientist; skills; Social Sciences; System; teacher; theories; Translating; Work,IN SUPPORT OF MOBILIZING STEM EDUCATION FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,12/31/2011,2008,99990.0
