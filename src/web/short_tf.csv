0,89996,"This is a project to explore Game-based, Metaphor Enhanced (GaME) design. GaME is a method for applying cognitive science metaphor theory toward the design of computer-mediated learning environments. The process uses structure mapping theory to design videogame worlds aligned with science concepts. This is a rigorous specification procedure for mapping relational structure from targeted concept to game world. GaME design translates a targeted concept into a game system, game play, and game goal. Because the relational structure of the game world is designed as an analog of the targeted conceptual domain, players begin to construct mental models of the targeted concept during interactive gameplay. This makes learning concrete and embodied. Gameplay experiences are designed to guide the learner to discover the relational structure of the targeted concept. This gameplay is a readiness activity for preparing the learner for subsequent instruction. The primary objective of the Cyber-Enabled Teaching and Learning through Game-based, Metaphor Enhanced Learning Objects (CyGaMEs) project is to empirically test this application of cognitive science theory. Aptly designed videogame worlds will provide common experience that prepares educators and their learners to achieve success. CyGaMEs employs cognitive science, informatic sciences, and analysis methodologies to enhance control over what games do: Engage learning through doing, discovery, and inquiry. While each player takes an idiosyncratic route, applied structure mapping theory ensures that gameplay exploration proceeds toward the learning goal.  Selene: A Lunar Creation GaME is the core of CyGaMEs research. This project will: (a) complete, refine and test existing Selene prototype, (b) collect GaME data representing perceptions and learning, (c) develop and refine new methods and metrics for assessing motivation, engagement, and achievement within instructional videogames, and (d) integrate GaME data collection and assessment within a cyber-enabled informatics infrastructure.",Achievement; analog; base; Cognitive Science; computer design; Conceptual Domain; Data; Data Collection; design; Educational process of instructing; Ensure; Environment; experience; Goals; Informatics; Instruction; Learning; Maps; Mediating; Metaphor; Methodology; Methods; Metric; Modeling; Motivation; Perception; Play; Procedures; Process; prototype; Psyche structure; Readiness; Research; Research Infrastructure; Route; Science; Structure; success; System; Testing; theories; Translating,"RUI: CYGAMES: CYBER-ENABLED TEACHING AND LEARNING THROUGH GAME-BASED, METAPHOR ENHANCED LEARNING OBJECTS",NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,8/31/2012,2008,1999467.0

3,89993,"Amphibian populations around the world are experiencing declines and mass mortalities at an unprecedented rate. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a primary cause of this epidemic, and differential susceptibility among species occurring in similar environments suggests that genetics may determine how individuals respond to infection. Zamudio and Lips will combine field and laboratory studies to test whether variability in immunity genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) confer differential survivorship to this emerging infectious disease, and how the disease itself alters the genetic and demographic composition of populations following an outbreak. The proposal focuses on frog populations in Central America where chytridiomycosis lethality is prevalent; however, their findings will be applicable to amphibian populations worldwide.This project will provide a better understanding of how emerging diseases shape adaptive molecular evolution, and how variability in immunity genes contribute to the response to novel disease threats.

6,90017,"The overall goal of this project is to investigate joint influences of genetic propensities and social-control on delinquent behavior. Previous sociological work has demonstrated the critical importance of social structural conditions, family processes, school structure, and peer networks.  These serve as informal social controls that bond individuals to social norms and ultimately may reduce delinquency.  The project draws data sources from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to address the question of why some individuals become serious and violent delinquents while others do not, despite growing up in a similar social context and participating in similar social processes.  Dr. Guo and his research teams will investigate the role of genetic propensities, especially as they interact with social control factors, in delinquency.  Specifically, they will use genotype data focusing on the genes that are known to be involved in aggressive behavior in mice to explore how genetic factors might influence delinquency and how those influences may depend on social control processes measured at the levels of friends, peers, family, school, and neighborhood.  This research is based on the premise that genetic effects on delinquency are best understood within a social science theoretical framework, which provides the basis for understanding delinquent behavior as socially produced and socially organized human activity. The newly created molecular genotype data will be merged with the rich social and behavioral longitudinal data in Add Health for other researchers to use.  The results of this study would contribute to the understanding of aggression and delinquency across the life course and could inform intervention efforts.",Address; Adolescent; Aggressive behavior; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Crime; Data; Data Sources; Family; Family Process; Friends; Genes; Genetic; Genotype; Goals; Health; Human Activities; Individual; Informal Social Control; Intervention; Joints; Life Cycle Stages; Longitudinal Studies; Molecular; Mus; Neighborhoods; peer; Process; Process Measure; Research; Research Personnel; Role; Schools; social; Social Controls; Social Environment; Social Sciences; Structure; Violence; Work,GENE BY SOCIAL-CONTROL INTERACTIONS FOR DELINQUENCY AND CRIME,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2011,2008,749361.0

10,90042,"The study of earth's topography has fundamental impacts on society, from flood and landslide prevention and control to the understanding of climate change impacts, management of land-use practices, as well as design of roads and other man-made projects in an environmentally sustainable way.  The recent availability of high resolution (0.5 m spacing) digital topography from airborne laser swath mapping and ground-based lidar offers opportunities to develop a new class of environmental predictive models that explicitly incorporate important features of the landscape and thus enhance the accuracy of predictions. The goal of this project is to develop modern computational geometric image analysis methodologies applicable to hydrologic and eco-geomorphologic hazard prediction and control. Specifically, the project studies high-resolution, multiscale, and dynamic topography with the goal of extracting channel networks, channel banks and shapes, floodplains and hazard-relevant features such as landslide prone areas and service roads which contribute to increased sediment production and thus stream habitat deterioration.  The mathematical and computational techniques to be exploited and developed come from the area of geometric non-linear partial differential equations and energy formulations, combined with differential and computational geometry. Specifically, a combination of methodologies ranging from geometric scale-space theory to singularity theory and geometric variational principles, combined with optimal algorithms for computing special curves on surfaces, will be exploited to derive a complete and automatic analysis of the topography at multiple relevant scales.",Algorithms; Area; base; climate change; Computational Technique; design; Deterioration; digital; Drug Formulations; Equation; Floods; Goals; Habitats; hazard; Image Analysis; Knowledge Discovery; land use; Lasers; man; Maps; Methodology; predictive modeling; Prevention; Production; Resolution; Services; Shapes; Societies; Stream; Surface; theories,CDI-TYPE I: GEOMETRIC IMAGE ANALYSIS FOR COMPUTATIONAL KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN GEOSCIENCES,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,8/31/2012,2008,467567.0
11,90053,"****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This Small Grant for Exploratory Research enhances research opportunities for minority students at a Historically Black University.  It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether an interpretation for the transport behavior of electrons in bismuth (Bi) nanowires when subjected to high magnetic fields is also valid for the recently observed behavior exhibited by charge carriers in bulk single crystal Bi.  The observed effects in bulk Bi have been interpreted as being due to the electrons in bulk Bi behaving like electrons constrained to moving only in a thin layer (i.e., exhibiting the fractional charge of a collective quantum state of 2 dimensional electrons).  The transport behavior in Bi nanowires has been interpreted as arising from electrons near the surface of the wire (i.e., the surface states).  However, there are similarities between the magnetic field dependent transport measurements of Bi nanowires and bulk Bi.  Low temperature electronic transport measurements in magnetic fields on bulk Bi will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal the possible contributions from surface states and fractional charge.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies.  ****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This Small Grant for Exploratory Research enhances research opportunities for minority students at a Historically Black University.  It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether surface states could explain the recently observed magneto-transport behavior in bulk Bi.  Recent experimental studies of the Nernst effect and Hall effect of bulk Bi in the quantum limit (magnetic fields larger than 9 Tesla) have been interpreted in terms of charge fractionalization, an unusual collective quantum state seen only in two-dimensional electron gases.  Absorption peaks with the same Shubnikov-deHaas period of 0.03/T have been observed in the magnetoresistance and thermopower of Bi nanowires both below and above the quantum limit of 9 T.  In this case an interpretation in terms of surface states related to a spin-orbit surface interaction was proposed. Measurements of the magnetoresistance and Hall effect of thin samples of bulk single-crystal bismuth in magnetic fields up to 45 T will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal possible contributions by surface states and fractional charge, allow evaluation of their properties such as effective masses, and permit evaluation of the relative importance of surface effects and electronic transport by bulk-like electrons and holes in bulk Bi.

15,90063,"Much of the literature on technological innovation focuses on analyzing measures of the scientific, technical, or commercial productivity of specific types of innovation-related activities in isolation, and does not consider the overall productivity of the linked sequences of these activities that constitute an innovation chain, from scientific discovery through commercialization. There currently is a gap in understanding of how different types of individual innovative activities come to be linked sequentially in a chain of events that ultimately may produce new commercial products or processes. Similarly, little is known about the organizational and institutional determinants of the overall productivity of linked sequences of such innovative events over time and space. This project analyzes the economic, organizational, and institutional determinants of the probability of a successful transition between such innovative events, and ultimately, toward commercially successful innovation, at each stage along the innovation chain. Data gleaned from patents, scientific publications, literature and patent citations, licensing agreements, research funding, and collaborative agreements are being used to construct a novel database of spatial and temporal linkages between activities and entities at each stage along an innovation chain, and to develop qualitative and quantitative indicators of knowledge and technology flows within these chains of linked events. The database is being constructed using case studies of nano-electronic innovations in the semiconductor industry, and applications of biotechnology innovations in the pharmaceutical industry. This research focus is inspired by efforts within these two mature high technology industries to experiment with novel strategies to integrate emerging technologies into their innovation pipelines. The variety and breadth of organizational, institutional, and funding strategies used to coordinate innovative activities in these industries provides a rich and varied set of data to be used in developing indicators and understanding of knowledge and technology flows. Broader Impacts: Although this research focuses on the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, the analysis should also have a broader impact in the development of more generally applicable stylized facts about determinants of the innovative process. The indicators of knowledge and technology flows being constructed are available for use as data in estimation of econometric models of determinants of the probability of a given R&D project successfully transitioning to various possible types of successor projects along an innovation chain, and ultimately, resulting in commercialization. Analysis of this database using a structural model provides empirical insights into the economic, organizational and structural factors that maximize the probability of success for innovation-related projects. These insights are a significant contribution to the development of a science of science and innovation policy. Further, decision makers in both the public and private sectors should be able to use these results to help choose among different possible organizational, institutional, and funding strategies, and improve the odds of successful innovation resulting from supported projects.",Agreement; Biotechnology; Case Study; case-based; commercialization; Data; Data Set; Databases; Development; Drug Industry; Econometric Models; Economics; Emerging Technologies; Event; Funding; Glean; improved; Individual; Industry; innovation; insight; Knowledge; Legal patent; Licensing; Link; Literature; Measures; Modeling; nanoelectronics; novel; novel strategies; Policies; Private Sector; Probability; Process; Productivity; Publications; Research; research and development; research study; Science; Semiconductors; Staging; Structural Models; success; technological innovation; Technology; Time,MODELING INNOVATION CHAINS USING CASE-BASED ECONOMETRICS: NANO-ELECTRONICS AND BIOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,8/31/2012,2008,374221.0

With support from the National Science Foundation, Julie McIntosh (Mooretown Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California) and her team will document the nearly extinct Northwestern Maidu language (also called Konkow or Concow Maidu).  It is now believed to have no more than four fluent speakers, and thus the urgency of the documentation effort is great. Although other Maiduan languages, particularly Northeastern (Mountain) Maidu, have received scholarly attention, Northwestern Maidu has so far been the subject of only limited study, and virtually none within the past forty years. The project will make video and audio recording of the speech of the remaining speakers; transcribe selected recordings; create a lexical database from both earlier sources and current speakers, and create an inventory of all extant written and electronic materials relating to the language. All language documentation materials will be prepared in a variety of paper, analog, and digital formats to make them maximally available both to the local indigenous communities and to researchers. With the silencing of hundreds of languages in the past decades, it has never been clearer that every human language represents a unique intellectual achievement, and that the loss of any language is a loss of knowledge that has repercussions far beyond the local community. The documentation of the Concow Maidu language will set the foundation for integrated research activities for the Maidu community, as well as for linguists.

18,90073,"Health care delivery in the U.S. is experiencing severe and worsening problems.  Costs are higher than in other countries and continue to increase, yet the overall quality of care delivered is not improving.  Increasing demand for health care as baby boomers become elderly is further straining the care delivery system.  Thus, dramatic changes are needed in health care delivery in the U.S. over the next decade.  One proposed solution is computer systems designed for health care, called health information technology (HIT).  These HIT systems, particularly electronic health records (EHR) that store patients? medical history and their interactions with physicians, promise significant improve¬ments in quality, effectiveness and productivity of care delivery.  Yet simply installing HIT without significantly changing existing work processes is unlikely to produce needed results. What is needed is an in-depth under¬standing of how HIT and process design techniques should be conceptualized and applied in health care. This project develops theories that can transform health care delivery processes in the U.S., through a deep understanding of the changes needed to make effective use of HIT and process design techniques.  The questions we address are: What capabilities does an EHR provide and which are used by health care organizations?  Which characteristics of the health care context, including characteristics of countries, the physician and nursing professions, and health care organizations, enable and inhibit the ability of health care organizations to take advantage of what EHR systems provide?  What are the dynamics of change by which EHR capabilities affect care delivery processes?  How and why do new EHR systems improve or reduce the quality and productivity of health care delivery processes?  How do health care organizations and individuals working in them need to change to make the most effective use of new EHR systems?  Answers to these questions will provide the knowledge needed to transform health care delivery processes in the U.S.This team will conduct multiple case studies of EHR implementation in health care organizations to understand the dynamics of change as the EHR implementation alters health care delivery processes.  The case studies will be carried out at our partner organizations, Fallon Clinic, UMass Memorial Health Care, Canada?s single payer system in British Columbia, and two of Israel?s four Health Fund systems.  These four settings provide different health care contexts, enabling us to observe and learn from their differences.  Improving the quality of health care delivered in the U.S. as well as reducing its cost has become a critically important societal goal.  The health care system is reaching a breaking point, and needs to be changed.  Simplistic solutions, however, will not work.

20,90090,"The Binding Principles, perhaps the most well studied principles in human language, state where in a sentence nominals (e.g., pronouns, common and proper nouns, etc.) may occur, and what they may/may not refer to. Many prominent researchers argue that these principles are part of our innate linguistic endowment because (i) they occur in the vast majority of languages for which we have data, and (ii) children in every language studied to date exhibit them at the very earliest testable ages. This argument for innateness is threatened somewhat by the existence of a handful of languages, e.g., Thai, in which the Binding Principles appear not to hold. If these principles are innate, exceptional languages like Thai should not exist.So why don't Thai speakers obey the Binding Principles? Thai children hold the answer to this puzzle: if Thai children, unlike Thai adults, exhibit knowledge of the Binding Principles at young ages, this will show that the principles are indeed part of our innate linguistic endowment, and that as children mature, they 'unlearn' these principles on the basis of adult input. However, if Thai children show no evidence of the Binding Principles at any stage in development, this will suggest that the principles are not innate. If this is the case, children acquiring other languages (e.g., English) do not have access to these innate principles, and must simply learn them on the basis of experience and other (non-linguistic) mechanisms. This project will test 80 Thai children aged 3yrs-7yrs and 20 adult Thai speakers on six experiments, each targeting a different aspect of the Binding Principles. The project will not only address one of the biggest debates in cognitive science (nature versus nurture), but it will also gather data from an understudied language, as well as establish and foster relations between academic institutions in Thailand and the United States.

22,90100,"SES-0817659Rachel L. EinwohnerPurdue UniversityThis study asks: Why does resistance take place in some situations but not others? What conditions facilitated the emergence of collective armed resistance? While current theories of social movement emergence argue that collective action occurs when groups of individuals have opportunity, resources, and a sense of efficacy, this study will make a contribution by examining resistance under conditions of extreme repression, limited resources, and great despair.  This research will study Jewish victims of the Holocaust who are commonly portrayed as passive individuals. Yet well known cases of Jewish resistance such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising demonstrate that in at least some places, Jews did rise up against their oppressors. Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe therefore provide a useful setting for an empirical study of the emergence of collective resistance under extreme circumstances. This project will make a contribution to the extant literature by examining an understudied context for collective action and use the results to develop new theoretical models. The investigator will conduct in-depth qualitative analysis and compare three strategically selected case studies: the Warsaw Ghetto (where collective Jewish resistance occurred), the Vilna Ghetto (where collective resistance was planned but not achieved), and the Lodz Ghetto (where collective resistance was never attempted). Data will include both primary and secondary sources, including transcripts from a random sample (N=120) of archived oral testimonies from survivors of each ghetto (40 from each ghetto). These testimonies are housed at the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation Institute. Oral testimony data will be analyzed using the qualitative software package NVivo.The study?s broader impacts are both educational and policy-related. First, the project will help contribute to extant knowledge about collective action and contentious politics in general. Although the results are intended primarily for professional academic audiences, they may also be used in other educational settings (e.g., Holocaust education in public schools). In addition, to the extent that they are disseminated more widely (e.g., through the media), the findings can also have an impact on the general public?s understanding of the Holocaust, especially by helping to dispel the myth of Jewish passivity. Lastly, the findings will have relevance to contemporary cases of resistance such as armed insurgencies, prison revolts and urban riots.",Archives; arm; California; Case Study; Computer software; Data; Education; Europe; follower of religion Jewish; Foundations; General Population; Ghetto; Holocaust; Housing; Individual; Institutes; Jews; Knowledge; Literature; Nazi; Oral; Policies; Politics; Prisons; Repression; Research; Research Personnel; Resistance; Resources; Riots; Sampling; Schools; social movement; Source; Survivors; Theoretical model; theories; Transcript; Universities,EXPLAINING COLLECTIVE ACTION UNDER EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,12/31/2010,2008,114380.0
23,90101,"The  Mathematics Teacher Transformation Institutes  (MTTI) project is a research-based investigation of how leadership emerges and is expressed through mathematics knowledge, student-focused instructional practices, and influences on schools' mathematics outcomes.  In particular, this research is broadening the knowledge base on teaching and learning in mathematics through new understanding of how the study of conceptually-challenging mathematics, particularly in algebra and geometry, benefits second-stage teachers (4-10 years' experience); of how classroom-based action research contributes to critical and analytical understanding of the relationships between teaching practices and student learning; and of how multi-levels of support prepare second-stage teachers for leadership roles. To achieve these research objectives, the City University of New York (CUNY), Herbert H. Lehman College is partnering with New York City Department of Education Districts 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.  Lehman College faculty in mathematics and mathematics education, staff of education centers and institutes who work in Bronx schools, and the Superintendents of Bronx districts work together to engage 80 experienced middle or high school teachers in the Bronx in 330 hours of professional development over 3 years to strengthen their leadership abilities, mathematics abilities, and educational practices.  These MTTI teacher participants are further supported on-site at their schools and through on-line discussion forums and are provided opportunities to showcase their work.  MTTI cultivates a professional network of mathematics teacher leaders who provide leadership to 200 additional middle and high school mathematics teachers as they enact a variety of roles including mentor, peer coach, presenter, conference participant/speaker, and active member of school curriculum and professional development teams.  Additionally, they participate in local and national discussions of current policy, practice, and research, and they develop informed understandings of the strengths and challenges of culturally and linguistically diverse classes.

Drawing on three well-documented frameworks, Culturally Relevant Pedagogical practices (CRP), Social Justice Youth Development Framework, and Future Time Perspective, this after-school and summer program fosters in IT/STEM related outcomes for 100 adolescent (grades 8-12) girls from several Phoenix high needs districts and schools. COMPUGIRLS takes place at two sites, ASU and the Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley-Sacaton. Already, 40 girls have completed one-year of the program. This project expands the program to include another 60 students, their parents, ASU graduate students and in-service teachers, and peer mentors. COMPUGIRLS provides hands-on technology experiences that include internships, Advanced Placement credit, conference and community presentations, and parent workshops that will ultimately develop participants' techno-social analytic skills for real world problems.As part of their experience, students visit ASU. For many, this is the first time they have been on a college campus. Students participate in 6 multimedia courses: 1) social justice and the media, 2) SCRATCH, user-friendly computer programming, 3) modding SIMS, designing, modifying, and troubleshooting simplified simulations, 4) choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, 5) advanced choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, and 6) teamwork to create neighborhoods in Sim City using all skills learned. Participants' projects will be disseminated semi-annually through community ceremonies, web pages, and presentations.The project builds upon a pilot program (Summer 2007 to present) that accommodated 40 girls from under-resourced districts in the Phoenix metro area. The COMPUGIRLS program is a two-year curriculum using multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking. The project advances understanding of how to encourage girls (including girls from underrepresented groups) to pursue ICT fields. It builds upon established research and includes evaluation of the impact on participants' computational thinking, techno-social analytical skills, attitudes about and interest in pursuing further education and careers in ICT/STEM fields. The goals are:1) To use multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking; 2) To enhance girls' techno-social analytical skills; and 3) To provide the building blocks for Arizona girls from underrepresented groups to successfully traverse an ICT and/or any work force roadmap. The evaluation of the project consists of a mixed-methods approach (qualitative and quantitative), incorporating the use of survey instruments, student journals, focus groups, interviews, document review, observation and an intensive case study. A comparison/control group is incorporated into the pre- and post-test design to determine the extent the participants' skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviors changed relative to where they would have been without participation in the project.","3-Dimensional; Administrator; Adolescent; Area; Arizona; Attitude; behavior change; boys; Build-it; Camping; career; Case Study; Cities; Collaborations; college; Communities; Computers; Control Groups; design; Development; Education; Educational Curriculum; Educational workshop; Engineering; Evaluation; experience; Focus Groups; Fostering; Future; girls; Goals; graduate student; Group Interviews; Hand; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; high school; Impact evaluation; Informatics; Institutes; interest; Internships; Journals; Leadership; Learning; Mentors; Methods; Multimedia; Neighborhoods; Outcome; Parents; Participant; peer; Pre-Post Tests; programs; Relative (related person); Research; Schools; Scientist; Services; simulation; Site; skills; social; Social Justice; Students; Surveys; symposium; teacher; Technology; Time; Universities; user-friendly; Video Games; Visit; web page; Work; Youth",COMPUGIRLS: A CULTURALLY RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM FOR GIRLS,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,8/31/2012,2008,879425.0
25,90103,"In most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. The scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. This project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. Its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. This work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. It is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. Variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. Structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. From a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data.  In practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. Its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. In carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. In addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords.

The project uses Earth Systems Science(ESS)content and inquiry-based instructional practices to emphasize themes that unite all sciences and mathematics. MITEP includes both summer and academic-year components, and uses a variety of on-site, residential, field, distance, and in-service delivery methods. Components promote leadership skills, collaboration, urban place-based inquiry, access to cutting-edge data and materials, technology, engagement of diverse learners, study of key scientific concepts that cross disciplinary boundaries, pedagogical innovation. The project will also implement and test lessons and units that challenge students and prepare them for further science study. Teachers receive stipends and credit as incentive for participating in the project and testing its approach to reform.    The project is based on the premise that successful reform depends on the full involvement of teachers who have the skills to lead their colleagues through the process of developing and implementing new instructional approaches. MITEP teacher-leaders and research university faculty are full partners in the process. Teacher-leaders are at the forefront of their schools' and district's efforts to evaluate, design, implement, and test new inquiry-based instructional programs. MITEP teacher-leaders help develop common pacing schedules and  course assessments. They assist with planning  professional development activities and providing ongoing assistance to colleagues. MITEP teacher-leaders are encouraged to disseminate information about the project through presentations at state and national conferences, to submit papers for publication.     Teacher-led reform is strongly supported by the administration of the core school district partner as an innovative way to generate enthusiasm for curricular and instructional change. To encourage development of leadership skills, school administrators give teacher-leaders progressively increased responsibility for strengthening curriculum, improving instructional strategies, and designing assessments.

28,89958,"The number of scientific journals and the number of papers published in those journals is increasing at a fast pace: currently, there are roughly 9,000 scientific journals, a twenty-fold increase from the 400 scientific journals available in 1955. The size and growth of the research literature places a tremendous burden on decision-making agents, such as funding agencies, university administrators, and reviewers, who have to evaluate the quality of research of individuals and institutions in a fast and efficient manner. In addition, the evaluation of individuals and institutions relies heavily on the assessment of the ultimate impact of published research, typically measured as the number of publications or the number of citations. Despite the oversimplification of using just a few numbers to quantify the scientific merit of a body of research, the entire science and technology community is relying more and more on citation-based statistics as a tool for evaluating the research performance of individuals and institutions and the development of tools that facilitate the evaluation task is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality standard for funded research.A major challenge is that stakeholders often want an estimate of the impact of a paper long before citations start to accumulate. This project aims precisely at facilitating such a task by developing tools to predict, soon after publication, the ultimate impact of research. This project uses longitudinal data available for papers published since 1955, drawing upon the concept that one can infer patterns of citation accumulation from large-scale analysis of historical data.

32,90118,"The research objective is the theoretical and practical design and implementation of new computational data models and query languages for the trajectories (both historical and predicted) of moving objects in both constrained and unconstrained environments. One aspect is to include the modeling and querying of current and predictive movement (e.g., the prediction of the future evolution of hurricanes and wild fires) into databases. This especially introduces the inherent feature of uncertainty of moving objects, incorporates the database support of prediction models independent of applications, and includes a homogeneous and seamless integration of both historical and predictive moving objects in unconstrained environments that allow free movement. Another aspect relates to the special situation of moving objects in constrained environments, and here especially in spatial networks (like vehicles in transportation networks). The main issues here are how spatial networks as well as moving objects in them can be designed, queried, and implemented within a database system. The solution approach is based on three fundamental algebras or type systems that are embedded into database systems: (i) the Moving Balloon Algebra (MBA) for predictive moving objects in unconstraint environments, (ii) the Network Algebra (NETALG) for geometric networks in spatial databases, and (iii) the Moving Object in Network (MONET) Algebra for moving objects in spatial networks. The resuls of this research are expected to have applications in areas where dynamically evolving spatial objects -- which change their location, shape, and extent over time -- play a role. Examples are meteorology, hurricane research, fire management, disaster management, navigation systems, environmental monitoring, transportation and distribution, emergency services, telecommunications, to name only a few.

34,90127,"SES-0818337Meredith Kleykamp   University of KansasThe project will measure whether employers exhibit discriminatory or preferential attitudes toward military veterans and whether this affects veteran treatment in the hiring process. This study explores how and why veteran outcomes differ by race/ethnicity and gender. The main goals of the project are to: 1) identify how military veterans fare in hiring, document the extent of differential hiring treatment of veterans and whether such treatment varies by race and gender using an experimental design 2) explore the mechanisms explaining employer  treatment of veterans, how employers evaluate military experience, and what meaning military experience holds in the civilian hiring process using in-depth interviews with hiring agents and 3) adjudicate competing sociological explanations for differential veteran/nonveteran employment outcomes, of human capital development, selection, signaling or screening, and cultural capital development on the basis of the audit and interview data.  Broader ImpactsThe research has broad reaching social impacts.  First, it contributes to both the academic and practical understanding of veteran hiring practices. Findings will foster development of veteran-friendly transition and employment policies.  Evidence of discriminatory hiring practices or negative sentiments toward military job seekers would suggest the need for better employer education on laws protecting military members and better evaluation of compliance with such laws.  On the other hand, evidence of preferential treatment could clarify that employment transition difficulties facing veterans lie elsewhere in the hiring or job matching process.   The project contributes to the recent University of Kansas-Ft. Leavenworth initiative facilitating collaboration between the University and the Army?s Command and General Staff College by providing information that can be used to aid military policymaking.",adjudicate; Affect; Attitude; base; Capital; Collaborations; college; Data; Development; Education; Employment; Evaluation; Exhibits; experience; Experimental Designs; Fostering; Gender; Goals; Hand; human capital; Interview; Kansas; Laws; Measures; member; Military Personnel; Occupations; Outcome; Policies; Process; Race; Research; Role; Screening procedure; Signal Transduction; Social Impacts; Universities; Veterans; War; Work,FINDING WORK AFTER WAR: THE ROLE OF MILITARY EXPERIENCE IN CIVILIAN HIRING,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,9/30/2010,2008,74060.0

36,89948,"Immigration is a major area of concern shaping contemporary policy, practice and debate in the United States. As a large scale agent of change, shifts in policy and perceptions concerning immigrants ripple through social networks, affecting household arrangements and resources that impact not only individuals, but families and whole communities. These impacts are felt by immigrants, naturalized citizens and natives who share the same communities, households and families. Recent research suggests that social networks among the urban poor can be eroded by macro-level economic and political uncertainty and instability, but comparatively little is known about how this process unfolds. Clear scientific evidence demonstrating how people are affected by such policy shifts can provide evidence for developing immigration-related policy and practice with fewer negative unintended consequences. With backgrounds in sociology, anthropology, human biology, geography and demography, the project team examined Latino households with at least one Spanish-speaking adult in south Phoenix, Arizona. Households were recruited by partnering with Latino community educators who are well-established in the area. Field interviews were conducted by bilingual students at Arizona State University. Using a range of tools and methods, including social network analysis and mathematical modeling, researchers determined if and how the households reorganized in response to changing immigration policy and practice. The study examined the social networks that link household members to each other and larger networks, and model the implications of this for the resource flows to household members and ultimately for household resiliency and the well-being of family members. Agent-based models were then applied to examine the potential impact of future large-scale shifts in immigration perceptions and policies.By focusing on the mechanism of social networks?as the framework in which decisions concerning resource flows are made, played out, and constrained?the study empirically ties well-being of household members to social policy shifts outside the household in new and more explicit ways. The project?s unique approach to data construction makes it possible to clarify the potential for changes in immigration enforcement or employer sanction laws to impact individuals who may or may not be directly targeted by these policies. At the local level, the data, findings, and related outreach activities will contribute to the development of research capacities within the target community and raise public awareness. Research findings, such as determining which factors enhance household stability and how social networks can be leveraged to move limited resources where they are most needed, were shared with local stakeholders to support their goals of building healthy communities.",Adult; Affect; Area; Arizona; Awareness; base; Communities; Data; Demography; Economics; enhancing factor; Family; Family member; Future; Geography; Goals; Household; Household and Family; Human Biology; Immigrant; Individual; In-Migration; Interview; Latino; Laws; Link; mathematical model; member; Methods; Modeling; network models; outreach; Pathway Analysis; Perception; Personal Satisfaction; Play; Policies; Process; Recruitment Activity; Research; research and development; Research Personnel; Resources; response; Shapes; social; Social Network; Social Policies; sociology/anthropology; Students; tool; Uncertainty; United States; Universities,"AOC: SOCIAL DYNAMICS IN RESPONSE TO SHIFTING IMMIGRATION POLICY AND PRACTICE: LATINO SOCIAL NETWORKS, RESOURCE FLOW, AND HOUSEHOLD REORGANIZATION",NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2011,2008,752249.0

39,89944,"The period between the late-Pleistocene glacial maximum and the early-Holocene thermal maximum (ca. 21,000 to 7,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic environmental change and biotic adjustments. The creation of new ecosystems in deglaciated regions was governed by the rate of ice recession, the nature of postglacial climate change, the characteristics of new landscapes, and the life-history traits of the biologic colonizers.The Yellowstone region supported the largest independent ice field in the western U.S., and ice recession after 17 cal ka set in motion a sequence of poorly-documented biologic events that ultimately led to the present-day terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This examination of the late-glacial and early-Holocene periods in the Yellowstone region poses the following questions: What are the primary controls of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem development on newly created landscapes? Specifically, how are past biota influenced by intrinsic biological constraints, landscape evolution, and subregional climate differences during a period of dramatic climate change? The study tests hypotheses concerning the importance of climatic and nonclimatic drivers in ecosystem development through an examination of lake-sediment records from sites that (1) lie along the path of ice recession, (2) span a variety of substrates, and (3) are situated within summer-wet and summer-dry precipitation regimes.  Yellowstone is an ideal region to examine the development and structuring of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, because (1) the climate history of the western US is reasonably well understood from prior data syntheses and paleoclimate model simulations; (2) a well-documented glacial history of the Yellowstone region offers independent information on local environmental change; (3) different substrates and precipitation regimes shape modern ecosystem distributions and likely have in the past as well; and (4) previous paleoecologic findings motivate more-nuanced research questions that can be addressed with the acquisition of new high-resolution records.Intellectual Merit of the Research: Understanding the biotic consequences of climatic change is a major challenge in Earth systems research and identified as a high priority in recent international and US climate change assessments. The proposed study builds on existing knowledge of Yellowstone's past in an effort to better understand the resilience of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to environmental change, including abrupt climate events of the magnitude projected in the future. This project adopts a stratified sampling approach that is not possible in most locations where paleobiotic data are sparse, and the information gained will help answer basic biologic questions about the importance of abiotic and biotic variables in modulating the effects of climate change on species, communities, and ecosystems. The resulting synthesis will be a critical step in bridging the gap between current understanding of ecological processes on short time scales and evidence of dramatic change preserved in paleoecologic data on long time scales.Broader Impacts of the Research lie in its contribution to ongoing efforts that better inform the public, land and resource managers, and students about the importance of environmental history in the national parks, including an understanding of past climate change and ecosystem sensitivity. This project in particular, extends outreach activities in a number of ways, among them regularly updated web-disseminated information by the National Park Service on Yellowstone's history; education and training activities for Park staff on cutting-edge paleoclimate research; incorporation of Yellowstone findings in Park-directed K-12 curricula and university coursework; publication in popular scientific magazines; and content for a new museum exhibit on Yellowstone.

40,89940,"The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Nebraska supports an interdisciplinary research program on Quantum and Spin Phenomena in Nanomagnetic Structures (QSPINS).  The MRSEC's research is centered on studies of new magnetic materials and structures at the nanometer scale, with the aim of developing fundamental understanding of their properties and related phenomena important for advanced technological applications.  QSPINS is organized into two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG1 'Nanoscale Magnetism: Structures, Materials and Phenomena' focuses on fundamental physics, chemistry, and materials issues in nanoscale magnets, addressing important quantum, electronic structure, nanofabrication, high-sensitivity measurements, and magnetization-dynamics problems.  Nanostructuring has reached a length scale where quantum approaches are needed, and this IRG brings a unique combination of theory, modeling, and new fabrication and measurement methods to the study of novel materials and phenomena.  The expected outcomes are new insights into phenomena and structures important for the development of novel cluster-assembled materials, higher energy-density permanent magnets, and information-technology materials. IRG2 'Magnetoelectric Interfaces and Spin Transport' employs the electron spin in a synergistic combination with novel nanoscale magnetic and ferroelectric structures to manipulate spin-dependent properties to yield new scientific concepts and achieve enhanced functionalities. Designed magnetoelectric and piezomagnetic heterostructures are to be investigated where the interplay between electricity, elasticity, and magnetism across interfaces manifests interesting unexplored phenomena, such as electrically-controlled exchange bias and magneto-crystalline anisotropy, and ferroelectrically-tailored spin transport. QSPINS's education and outreach programs encourage gifted young people to pursue scientific careers, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science through targeted programs, and improve materials literacy among the general public.  As an integral part of the Center, QSPINS offers interdisciplinary training for the next generation of materials scientists and engineers by providing regional four-year institutions experience and tools to improve their materials science programs and curricula, offering opportunities for middle- and high-school teachers and their students to learn about materials science, and by addressing pre-college segments of the educational pipeline via targeted outreach activities.  QSPINS maintains shared experimental and computational facilities and supports exploratory Seed Projects to provide continual revitalization of the projects and investigators and promote new interdisciplinary collaborations.

41,89939,"PI: David Hannapel (Iowa State University)CoPIs: Aragula G. Rao (Iowa State University), Jeff Coller (Case Western Reserve University), William J. Lucas (University of California, Davis)Plants perceive outside signals that activate pathways to control their defenses and growth. The length of daylight or photoperiod is a key signal that regulates growth processes like flowering in many plants and tuber formation in potato. Tuber formation in potato involves the transport of a light-activated signal from the leaf to the underground organ, the potato tuber. The overall scientific objective of this project is to study the range of signals that are responsible for controlling tuber formation. Signals involved in this process include both proteins and RNA. Two research goals will be addressed in this project: 1) To identify and characterize RNAs of potato that are transported from the leaf to the underground tuber and 2) To identify proteins that work with the RNAs to facilitate this transport. Several approaches will be undertaken to implement these research goals, including the systematic characterization of the network of RNAs and proteins present in this transport system. Proteins and RNAs will be identified and tested for their function in this signaling system. The primary goal of this project is to understand how this collection of signals regulates tuber formation. The utility of this research activity is that the information generated by these experiments will have direct applications for enhancing crop productivity. The broader scientific impacts resulting from this research activity are inherent in the enhancement of our understanding of how plants use light signals to control their growth and, for agronomic crops, to affect their yield. A significant component of this project is the educational and outreach features. The educational component will be implemented through the Summer Internship program that will provide high school and undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in plant biology projects. As a component of outreach training, summer internships for high school biology teachers will also be offered. These teachers will work with project leaders on the Iowa State, UC-Davis, or Case Western Reserve campuses to learn more about plant biology. By targeting high school teachers who may teach up to 100 students a year, the influence of this program will be greatly expanded and will fulfill a primary mission of NSF; to communicate to society the significance of the outcomes of current research in plant biology. The international component of this project will expand the breadth of training available through this initiative and enhance global awareness of the scientific challenges addressed in this research. This project includes ample opportunities for participation by women and underrepresented groups in laboratory research.

44,89917,"This project examines the information seeking and using behaviors of decision makers who face decisions about their future R&D investments.   A number of trends have made these decisions more uncertain, notably  Open Innovation,  the globalization of science and technology, increasingly diverse sources of technical and scientific information, as well as the global outsourcing of research to developing economies.  There is substantial evidence that industrial decision makers lack needed information; are unaware of available information; or need a more inclusive model of appropriate decision processes.  The study sheds light on whether and why industry decision makers choose global R&D over U.S. R&D.  It does this by examining how firms that are global innovators use information about scientific and technical resources, together with other innovation-related data, to shape their investment decisions and competitive strategies.  The project is based on collaboration with the Center for Innovation Management Studies and the Industrial Research Institute (IRI), whose 250 members collectively fund and conduct about 75% of U.S. industrial research. These firms' day-to-day R&D investment decisions are transforming traditional company-owned R&D laboratories into the  Laboratory of the Future  (LOF). Each firm's own  LOF  may consist of a traditional laboratory, a collaborative laboratory, a virtual laboratory or a network of external resources, including university researchers in the U.S. or abroad, as well as government or private labs, collaborative strategic partners, or simulation tools thus augmenting or even replacing company owned physical labs. LOFs are highly likely to vary by industry and by the competitive environment of the firm. The study examines participants' discussions of these decisions and the information resources they use to decide how to build their future innovation capabilities. The project analyzes the LOF discussion to reveal how R&D managers think long-term and strategically about what they do.  The project documents information seeking and information using behavior as exhibited in an on-line discussion by the decision makers about the R&D  LOF . In addition the research opens a window into decision makers' rationales for their investment commitments.Broader Impacts: Corporate R&D executives are making decisions now that will, in the aggregate, shape the LOF and affect U.S. national innovation system. This project documents how they are making those decisions, what information they are presently using, and what kinds of data might be desirable for robust decisions. The project results inform both decision makers in industry and policy makers about data and information sources presently used, not used, and data not presently available but desirable for the future.",Affect; base; Behavior; Collaborations; Data; Decision Making; Environment; Exhibits; Face; Foundations; Funding; Future; Government; Industry; Information Resources; innovation; Investments; Laboratories; Light; member; Modeling; Outsourcing; Participant; Policy Maker; Process; Research; research and development; Research Institute; Research Personnel; Resources; Science; Shapes; simulation; Source; System; Technology; tool; trend; Universities; virtual,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH - MOD: THE R&D ''LAB'' OF THE FUTURE: FOUNDATIONS FOR MODELING THE R&D/INNOVATION PLANNING PROCESS,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2010,2008,155648.0

47,89905,"For nearly a century, biologists have debated whether past climate change promoted speciation in temperate zone organisms.  Models of climate-driven geographic speciation were developed for many groups of temperate organisms, and a particularly detailed and explicit speciation model was developed for North American birds. Over the last decade, this paradigm for North American birds has become the topic of debate, and so a comprehensive understanding of how temperate zone birds were impacted by past environmental change events remains elusive. This project will directly test the paradigm and will significantly extend understanding of the history of the fauna of pine and oak woodlands. The work will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of diversification of North American birds in relation to past environmental change and will produce a multi-locus comparative phylogeography of pine and oak woodland birds. The project provides significant mentoring and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including many students from underrepresented groups, and gives these students a unique opportunity to work in a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research effort between a small rural university and two large urban research universities.

The investigators are targeting to devise means of employing instead lignocellulosic biomaterials (biocarbons) that originate naturally from within America.  The team will build on their recently-devised means of functionalizing the porous biocarbons with reduced-nitrogen groups that remove perchlorate and other oxyanions.

52,89898,"ABSTRACT: This project develops a methodology and statistically implements a data collection and evaluation process for assessing the innovative performance of firms located on U.S. university research parks (URPs).  The results from the assessment phase inform the public and private sector about locational investments in science and engineering (S&E) activities occurring on URPs.  URPs have been an important element of our national innovation system for nearly half a century, and in 2007 the  Building a Stronger America Act  (S. 1373) was introduced in Congress under the stated premise that it is in the best interests of the Nation to encourage the formation of new parks and the expansion of existing parks in order to promote the clustering of innovation through high technology activities.  Surprisingly, very little research has been undertaken on science/research parks, in general, or URPs, in particular.  And, no research has been undertaken on the innovation benefits realized by firms that locate on U.S. parks.  This project broadens our understanding of URPs as a component of our national innovation system; develops an assessment tool for assessing the innovation benefits realized by firms as a result of locating on a park; collects relevant data to implement this methodology and offers empirically-based statements on realized innovation benefits from on-park research synergies; and offers prospective statements about the organizational structure of URPs that will be most conducive to enhancing the research synergies among park firms on new or expanded parks.BROADER IMPACTS:  The main intellectual outputs from this research are an assessment of the innovative performance of, and research outputs from, on-park firms relative to comparable firms that are not located on a park.  As such, this project's broader impacts include, from a national perspective, the development of park-based science metrics and policy prescriptions to enhance university-driven S&E-based economic development through park formations and park growth.  And, from a private-sector perspective, this project informs the locational consideration, and hence future research efficiency, of firms' S&E investments.  The project's resulting science metrics inform the consideration of new innovation indicators specifically related to parks.  The project's policy prescriptions inform not only Congressional deliberations related to the  Building a Stronger America Act  but also future state and regional S&E investment considerations for building new UPRs and/or expanding existing ones.",Americas; base; Congresses; Data; data collection evaluation; Development; Economic Development; Elements; Engineering; Future; Growth; innovation; interest; Investments; Methodology; Metric; organizational structure; Output; Performance; Phase; Policies; Private Sector; Process; prospective; Relative (related person); Research; Science; System; Technology; tool; Universities,UNIVERSITY RESEARCH PARKS AND THE INNOVATIVE PERFORMANCE OF PARK FIRMS,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,12/31/2010,2008,182231.0
53,89892,"Abstract For nearly a century, biologists have debated whether past climate change promoted speciation in temperate zone organisms. Models of climate-driven geographic speciation were developed for many groups of temperate organisms, and a particularly detailed and explicit speciation model was developed for North American birds. Over the last decade, this paradigm for North American birds has become the topic of debate, and so a comprehensive understanding of how temperate zone birds were impacted by past environmental change events remains elusive. This project will directly test the paradigm and will significantly extend understanding of the history of the fauna of pine and oak woodlands. The work will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of diversification of North American birds in relation to past environmental change and will produce a multi-locus comparative phylogeography of pine and oak woodland birds. The project provides significant mentoring and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including many students from underrepresented groups, and gives these students a unique opportunity to work in a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research effort between a small rural university and two large urban research universities. The project also will support a workshop for high school teachers from the rural and reservation communities of western South Dakota and provide them the knowledge and resources to teach about climate change and its impact on biotic diversity in their classrooms.",abstracting; American; Arts; Birds; Climate; climate change; comparative; Educational process of instructing; Educational workshop; environmental change; Event; graduate student; high school; Indian reservation; Interdisciplinary Study; Knowledge; Mentors; Modeling; Molecular; North America; Organism; Pattern; Recording of previous events; Research; Resources; Rural; School Teachers; South Dakota; Students; Techniques; Testing; Universities; Work,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: MULTILOCUS COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY OF PINE-OAK WOODLAND BIRDS IN NORTH AMERICA,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2011,2008,149619.0

The series is focused on climate, weather, and water processes and issues that are particularly relevant to American Indian communities and tribal lands and is expected to provide a foundation for TCU students interested in climate change.  The courses are being designed to provide American Indian and other students the opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of the physical, cultural, and technological issues associated with climate change and the mitigation of its effects on the earth and its people.  The course series has two components.  The first is a semester-long undergraduate climate change science course taught from the perspective of the traditional ecological knowledge held by Native peoples of North America.  The second is an Indigenous-based research practicum using Cyberinfrastructure-enabled access to Geosciences data, instrumentation and computing resource that provides an opportunity for Tribal College students to practice state-of-the-art e-Science, in collaboration with elders, community members, and research mentors at NCAR.

55,90201,"For the vast majority of human history, people all over the world have lived in small social groups as hunters and gatherers, and not in towns or villages. Agriculture has been claimed to be the driving force for recent population expansions: in the strongest claims, almost all current language families ultimately have their pre-industrial distribution because of agricultural expansion. While the spread of farming and languages associated with it has claimed a lot of recent attention, there has been very little corresponding work on the languages of hunter-gatherers. It is important for our overall understanding of social dynamics to analyze what drives change and spread among hunter-gatherers and determine whether such processes are different from what occurred after the farming revolution, 10,000 years ago. Researchers from the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia will collaborate on work comparing hunter-gatherer groups on three continents (North America, South America, and Australia). In North and South America, some hunter-gatherer languages have spread over large distances, but farming and associated languages have also spread widely, and in some cases farmers reverted to foraging. In Australia, the transition to farming never took place but one language family spread very widely. Results from genetics, linguistics, anthropology and archaeology will be combined to clarify what the relative contributions of migration and language shift were to language spreads. Among the linguistic data to be collected are vocabulary in the fields of plants and animals, and kinship and social organization.",Agriculture; Animals; Anthropology; Archaeology; Attention; Australia; Canada; Data; driving force; Family; farmer; Farming environment; Genetic; Human; Language; Life; Linguistics; migration; New Zealand; North America; Plants; Population; Process; Recording of previous events; Relative (related person); Research Personnel; small social group; social; social organization; South America; Vocabulary; Work,DYNAMICS OF HUNTER-GATHERER LANGUAGE CHANGE,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,12/31/2008,2008,
56,89882,"Mathematics (21) This collaborative project addresses a problem that occurs in many mathematics and mathematics-related courses at the university-level across the US: high failure rates in important early college mathematics courses, especially in Calculus I. The teaching strategy being used and tested is based on the idea of using Enhanced Conceptual Development through Focused Oral Discourse, or Orals. The current work is analyzing and extending  earlier work that has been focused on helping students identified as at risk of failing calculus. Based on the earlier success of reducing failure rates using effective teaching strategies, including Orals, the project team is now applying these teaching strategies to diverse users in several new settings: to classes taught in different STEM (science, technology engineering, and mathematics) departments, at a different college, and at different educational levels. The goals of this project are to: 1) Refine, implement, and test Orals with diverse groups of learners and in diverse education settings; 2) Provide training, coaching and evaluation for facilitators of Orals including Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants; 3) Provide extensive assessment artifacts of the implementations; 4) Create a database and website of new learning materials (Orals questions for diverse courses); and 5) Improve the retention and understanding of STEM students. Intellectual Merit: The importance of discourse in the mathematical sciences classroom has already been shown for K-12. A potentially important impact of this proposal will be to contribute to the national dialogue by conducting careful experiments that assess one method of increasing discourse: Orals. In particular, the project team will conduct proof of concept studies of Orals, in moving from small classrooms (the original setting) to large lecture sections. Broader Impact: Many STEM majors require successful completion of a calculus sequence; however, many university students do not achieve their career goals because of their inability to pass the introductory calculus courses. This project will address this important national issue.

58,89863,"This Phase I CCI will place chemistry at the center of research efforts to describe the molecular composition of the universe. The Center for Chemistry of the Universe will assemble a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary group of researchers to investigate and understand chemical processes in the interstellar medium. The chemistry occurring under the unique conditions of the interstellar medium produces the initial molecular starting materials for solar system formation. This chemistry, which produces a surprisingly rich set of common organic molecules along with more exotic reactive species, also supplies the molecules in meteorites and comets that may deliver the building blocks of life to young planets. Understanding this chemistry will require the development of high-speed broadband mm-wave spectrophotometers for chemical identification as well as new methods to probe chemical reactivity in cold gases and on surfaces. The Center will establish connections between fields such as combustion chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, and materials processing that share the theme of  chemistry under extreme conditions.  The Center will provide a team-oriented, collaborative and multidisciplinary research environment for graduate student and postdoctoral researchers.

59,89862,"Bacteria, fungi and a suite of other microorganisms are the engines that drive many essential soil processes. They recycle the nutrients that all plants depend upon, they decompose organic materials that would otherwise accumulate, and they convert soil organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2). Thus, though invisible to the naked eye, soil microbes can influence a suite of global processes, including atmospheric composition and global climate. While the importance of microbial processes is clear, much less is known about the types or numbers of organisms that are responsible for carrying out within-soil processes. This is particularly true for tropical rain forests, the most diverse biomes on land. In this project, a suite of techniques, observations and experiments will be applied to examine the factors that regulate soil microbial community composition, and to determine how seasonal changes in tropical rain forest ecosystems are related to changes in soil microbial communities.  An improved understanding of decomposition and CO2 fluxes in tropical forests is relevant to a variety of societal issues, as they play a major role in regulating global carbon and nutrient cycles, atmospheric chemistry, and climate.

61,89859,"Coastal ecosystems are experiencing changes in nutrient loading and species composition much higher than previously measured, undoubtedly affecting productivity and sustainability of coastal regions. Predicting the impacts of these changes is important in salt marshes because marshes are among the most biologically productive areas in the world and provide critical ecosystem services, such as nursery areas for fisheries, removal of nitrogen, and shoreline storm buffering.  This project addresses a critical question: What are the effects of increased nutrients and species change on ecosystem services provided by salt marsh ecosystems? The project is the first to use whole-ecosystem experiments that alter nutrient loading and reduce fish populations to understand the effects on nutrient cycling, species diversity, food webs and the long-term sustainability of salt marshes.The damage by Hurricane Katrina due to degradation of coastal wetlands is one example of the importance of salt marshes to society. A growing appreciation of this role for marshes has led to estuaries becoming the focus of large-scale restoration programs.

62,89858,"Experimental cybersecurity research is inherently risky. An experiment may involve releasing live malware code, operating a botnet, or creating highly disruptive network conditions. Realism is required in replicating attacks so that proposed defenses can be thoroughly tested and future attacks anticipated. This proposal, in addressing intellectual merit, seeks to develop a unique model for risky experiment management; enabling researchers to carry out experiments that interact with their larger environment while retaining both control and safety. The model forwarded here is based on a very simple line of reasoning: If the behavior of an experiment is completely unconstrained, the behavior of the host environment must be completely constraining, because it can assume nothing about the experiment; but, if the behavior of the experiment is constrained in some particular and well-chosen way or ways, the behavior of the host testbed can be less constraining, because the combination of experiment and environment constraints together can provide the required overall assurance of good behavior.  The key benefit of this model is that both experimenter and testbed operator can proceed with assurance in carrying out a wide and interesting range of previously unsupportable experiments. The ultimate goal is to develop both implementation and formalization of this model, including logical tools to reason about experiment and testbed constraint composition (broader impact). Initial work will develop mechanisms to support the model in the DETER facility and similar Emulab-based testbeds.The proposal was reviewed by panelists and received one Very Good, one Very Good/Good and one Good.  Panelists viewed all three elements of the proposal (risky experimentation support, dynamic health monitoring, and federation of testbeds) to represent contributions to the field, with the most valuable area of the three being risky experimentation support. The panel overall wanted to see a stronger case made for improving existing security testbeds in general, and particularly a tie in with current uses and needs of the DETER testbed by researchers.

The NanoTeach Teacher's guide is being designed for self study by teachers (low treatment group) and for use in a facilitated development model (high treatment group). The NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide outlines the professional development experiences and provides guidance for facilitators. The professional development model combines (1) a design framework (Designing Effective Science Lessons based on the C-U-E model: content, understanding, and environment); (2) nanoscale science content from NSF-funded curriculum projects; and (3) multiple delivery methods. Twenty teachers are being recruited to carry out the pilot testing of the professional development materials. 75 teachers in the high treatment group are experiencing a 2-week summer workshop, asynchronous sessions while they implement their first lesson, Versatile Classroom (a synchronous, online video technology), implementation of a second lesson, and a final 2-week summer workshop. 75 teachers in the low treatment group experience a brief orientation to nanoscience resources, have access to the NT Teacher's Guide, implement two lessons, and debrief.

In addition, the following are supporting partners: The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA), IMSA-affiliated school districts, and Thornton elementary and middle school feeder districts.  EnLiST intends to develop and build the infrastructural elements necessary to sustain a state-wide Illinois community of highly qualified science Teacher Leaders, who will effectively contribute to the transformation of science teaching and learning throughout the K-12 educational continuum in their districts. EnLiST will achieve these goals through a combination of intensive summer institutes and year-round professional development and collaborative activities. The synergy and continuity of these efforts will be ensured through establishment of an on-line community capitalizing on robust technological tools and infrastructure. EnLiST will commence with the development of core cadres of high school chemistry and physics Teacher Leaders organized into district teams. Next, the partnership will support and scaffold the activities of these core cadres as they engage in developing a cadre of middle school and elementary specialist science Teacher Leaders in their school districts. The activities of this latter participant group will focus on an interdisciplinary approach to science teaching and learning in elementary and middle school. Data collection and use will be a central theme in the development of Teacher Leaders and project operation as a whole. The innovation of EnLiST is its intent to reconceptualize the very notion of a  Teacher Leader  by drawing on scholarship in the field of social and entrepreneurial leadership and theories of distributed leadership.  EnLiST aims to create a new generation of Teacher Leaders who, armed with cutting edge content knowledge, a strong pedagogical repertoire, and entrepreneurial spirit, can support their colleagues and transform their schools into responsive and data driven institutions of teaching and learning.  EnLiST will provide participant science Teacher Leaders with understandings, skills, attitudes, and habits of mind enabling them to perceive themselves, and to act, as agents of change.  The entrepreneurial leadership skills that will be developed will arm these Teacher Leaders to meet the many challenges faced by teachers in the current US K-12 educational milieu, including dealing with resource constraints, uncertainty, and multiple goals often related to internally desired and externally imposed demands for change and innovation. They will be equipped to meet the challenges and tensions that have often impeded the adoption of innovative curricula and pedagogies and transformation of K-12 science instructional practices in service of addressing increasingly diverse student population needs. The major research questions of the project will center on understanding and assessing the development of the target Teacher Leaders and the success of those leaders in transforming their own teaching.  The ultimate aim is to develop a scalable national model for the preparation of social and entrepreneurial science Teacher Leaders who act as strong champions and effective initiators and implementors of change in pre-college science teaching and learning.

65,89853,"PRISM Phase II is conducting research on strategies that lead to changes in the culture of science and mathematics education where dimensions of culture include policies, practices, partnerships, and resources.  Research studies in PRISM Phase II are producing further evidence of how and to what extent distinctive PRISM Phase I strategies - K-16 Professional Learning Communities, Culture of Higher Education and a Public Awareness Campaign - give rise to these four key elements of holistic cultural change.  The Phase II PRISM partnership is producing these outcomes through an integrated set of research studies focused on the following questions: 1) In what ways and to what extent do K-16 professional learning communities lead to partnerships which change professional practice of K-16 educators and improve student learning in K-16 science and mathematics? 2) To what extent do policy change and incentive structures that reward higher education faculty to collaborate with K-12 schools and to strengthen their own teaching result in sustainable changes in departmental and institutional culture, including changed policies, changed practices, new partnerships and dedicated resources, in higher education? 3) To what extent do schools that participate in the Public Awareness Campaign have greater student motivation, greater parental involvement and higher student achievement in science and mathematics than non-participating schools? PRISM Phase II expects to culminate in replicable models for implementing the three strategies in ways which elicit changes in culture and ultimately strengthen K-16 science and mathematics education.  Based upon the successes of PRISM Phase I, the University System of Georgia (USG) has launched a STEM Initiative, in FY 2009, designed to replicate the successes of PRISM throughout all 35 USG institutions.  Through STEM Initiative funding, 12 institutions will implement K-16 professional learning communities and faculty incentive programs for participation in the scholarship of teaching and learning with faculty from all USG institutions invited to participate in STEM-focused Faculty Institutes on the Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics.  The implementation of STEM Initiative-supported learning communities provide a broad base of activity to support experimental studies, as well as avenues by which the results of the Phase II work also immediately inform the work of the STEM Initiative team.  This provides a direct avenue of dissemination of Phase II results to all public institutions of higher education in Georgia.

66,89850,"Mathematics (21) This collaborative project addresses a problem that occurs in many mathematics and mathematics-related courses at the university-level across the US: high failure rates in important early college mathematics courses, especially in Calculus I. The teaching strategy being used and tested is based on the idea of using Enhanced Conceptual Development through Focused Oral Discourse, or Orals. The current work is analyzing and extending  earlier work that has been focused on helping students identified as at risk of failing calculus. Based on the earlier success of reducing failure rates using effective teaching strategies, including Orals, the project team is now applying these teaching strategies to diverse users in several new settings: to classes taught in different STEM (science, technology engineering, and mathematics) departments, at a different college, and at different educational levels. The goals of this project are to: 1) Refine, implement, and test Orals with diverse groups of learners and in diverse education settings; 2) Provide training, coaching and evaluation for facilitators of Orals including Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants; 3) Provide extensive assessment artifacts of the implementations; 4) Create a database and website of new learning materials (Orals questions for diverse courses); and 5) Improve the retention and understanding of STEM students. Intellectual Merit: The importance of discourse in the mathematical sciences classroom has already been shown for K-12. A potentially important impact of this proposal will be to contribute to the national dialogue by conducting careful experiments that assess one method of increasing discourse: Orals. In particular, the project team will conduct proof of concept studies of Orals, in moving from small classrooms (the original setting) to large lecture sections. Broader Impact: Many STEM majors require successful completion of a calculus sequence; however, many university students do not achieve their career goals because of their inability to pass the introductory calculus courses. This project will address this important national issue. The new work will not only be in a larger variety of mathematics courses, but also in introductory Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering courses, and at a local high school in a two-year algebra course.",Address; base; Calculi; career; college; Colorado; Databases; Development; Education; Educational process of instructing; Educational Status; Engineering; Evaluation; Goals; high school; improved; instructor; Learning; lectures; Mathematics; Mechanics; Methods; Morphologic artifacts; Oral; Phase; Research; research study; Risk; Science; Students; success; Technology; Testing; Training; Universities; university student; web site; Work,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: CCLI-PHASE 2: COLORADO MOMENTUM: ORAL ASSESSMENT IN THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES CLASSROOM,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2011,2008,45040.0
67,89848,"Recently, the 230Th constant-flux proxy (CFP) profiling method of calculating sediment accumulation rates (ARs) has become a topic of significant controversy, especially with respect to the issue of sediment focusing and its quantification.  Depending on whether one derives ARs using age models or CFPs leads to vastly different interpretations in paleoceanographic studies.   Under this award the PIs will investigate sediment redistribution processes to determine the veracity of the 230Th CFP.  They will measure another CFP with an independent source term, namely interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), and the extraterrestrial 3He contained therein.  Agreement between 230Th and 3He variations in varied and well-studied depositional environments in the North Atlantic would constitute further support for the use of both CFPs for flux normalization. The data generated on sites with known amounts of sediment focusing and winnowing will help constrain the influence of abyssal currents on IDPs and the sediments carrying adsorbed 230Th, and will provide insights into the extent of hydrodynamic sorting of these particles. When combined with 14C and paired 3He and 230Th measurement on various separated fractions of the fine-grained component of the sediment, the PIs will test the hypotheses that 1) 3He is less sensitive than 230Th to sediment focusing, and 2) the degree to which sediment redistribution processes fractionate 3He-containing IDPs from the 230Th containing portion of the sediment. In the future, the proponents hope to develop a new proxy (3He/230Th ratio) for changes in the strength of deep-sea currents in association with past climatic changes.

69,89841,"Groundwater flow systems within the Great Basin, Nevada are remarkable in many respects. Despite the arid conditions and relatively low permeability volcanic rocks and basin fill, this region hosts active geothermal systems and world class Eocene age gold deposits. Temperature profiles, fluid inclusion studies, and isotopic evidence suggest that modern and fossil hydrothermal systems share many common features including the absence of a clear magmatic fluid source, discharge areas restricted to fault zones, and remarkably high temperatures ( >200 °C) at shallow depths (200-1500 m). Many of the Great Basin geothermal systems exhibit some of the highest shallow crustal heat flow levels ever recorded ( > 2000 mW/m2 at Beowawe) within the continental crust. Geochemical and isotopic data collected at the Beowawe geothermal system suggests that fluid circulation is deep (> 5 km) and comprised of relatively unexchanged Pleistocene meteoric water with small ä18O (The goal of this proposal is to understand the three-dimensional plumbing, fluid flow impelling mechanisms, and temporal evolution of modern and fossil hydrothermal flow systems within the Great Basin. We wish to evaluate two end member questions regarding the nature of hydrothermal circulation within the Great Basin: A) Is flow restricted to high permeability fault planes driven by free-convection? or B) is flow driven by water-table topographic gradients with some combination of matrix and fault controlled fluid circulation? Because of the lack of broad low heat flow anomalies adjacent to Great Basin geothermal fields, we suspect that these flow systems must be episodic in nature due to permeability reduction associated with silica mineralization. By including the systematics of silica precipitation (and associated porosity/permeability reduction), we hope to constrain the duration of these geothermal systems. We will develop a suite of 3D, single-phase, hydrothermal models using a new parallel finite element code (PGEOFE) for two field sites within the Great Basin. We will develop geologically/geophysically constrained, three-dimensional hydrothermal models of the modern Beowawe and fossil Carlin geothermal systems; two sites with rich , isotopic, geochemical and geothermal data sets. Using LaGrit mesh generation software, these hydrogeologic models will honor known fault geometries, widths, and stratigraphy. A unique feature of the proposed work is that we will use multiple constraints including temperature profiles, shallow heat flow maps, fluid/rock ä 18O composition, and the age of hot springs deposits to test our models. We will also develop more sophisticated reactive-transport geochemical models using PFLOTRAN incorporating porosity-enhancing carbonate dissolution reactions to constrain how long the Carlin flow systems remained active before becoming clogged by gangue mineralization. By dating organic matter (pollen) within the hot springs deposits at Beowawe using 14C dating methods, we hope to determine whether or not these hot springs deposits formed during a single event or in several episodes.Our study may help document the existence of time-dependent natural convection systems within the Great Basin. Understanding the mechanisms and patterns of fluid circulation within this region is of great societal relevance because this region may soon host our nation?s high level nuclear wastes.

70,89840,"TECHNICAL ABSTRACTData-intensive science requires tera- and peta-scale computing. Hardware demands are high, and software, from system to application level, is highly specialized. As a result, scientific investigation is constrained. New and more accessible models for large-scale computing are required. The proposed program seeks to leverage new off-the-shelf computing technologies to develop concepts and tools (e.g., programming strategies, general-purpose and domain-specific libraries) to enable practical and transparent Scalable Heterogeneous Computing (SHC). Results will be applied to three cutting-edge challenges in radio astronomy, quantum chemistry, and neuroscience. These three applications share the need to process massive data streams. They broadly span a parameter space of processing challenges, defined by complexity in computation, data volume, and throughput. Addressing these requires scalable algorithms for massive datasets, systems with high-bandwidth memory access, and the ability to process high-throughput data streams.    Proposed SHC strategies, tools, and optimizations would develop, for general scientific computing, use of massively parallel graphics processing units (GPUs) and fast, low-power, large-volume, solid-state storage (SSS) devices that are commercially available. The tools developed will be applied to the analysis of radioastronomy data generated by the Muchison Wide-Field Array, the development of a SHC-enabled molecular quantum chemistry code, and to the Connectome project, an effort to make a complete map of the neuron connectivity of mammalian brains. Education is tightly integrated into the SHC program at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Initiatives to disseminate results will include tutorials and documented open-source libraries as well as workshops.LAY ABSTRACTScientists engaged in data-intensive research, from astronomy to neuroscience, are in desperate need of new strategies and tools. This project approaches the challenge by leveraging new off-the-shelf hardware and software technologies in unique combinations. The project will bring massively parallel graphics processing units and fast solid-state storage devices together with traditional central processing units. Project staff will develop scalable algorithms that leverage this commercially available hardware to process massive data sets and streams of data. The project will use three major scientific challenges as testbeds for development of these new approaches: a radioastronomy telescope called the Murchison Wide-Field Array; exploration of chemistry at the quantum level; and the Connectome, an effort to make a complete map of the neuron connectivity in mammalian brains. Postdoctoral researchers from astronomy, chemistry, neuroscience, and computer science will work together at Harvard?s Initiative in Innovative Computing, where they will combine experience from these domains to develop algorithms and code to broadly enable advances in science.

71,89839,"Collaborative Research: Time-Dependent Hydrothermal Convection within the Great Basin, NevadaIs groundwater flow restricted  to  high permeability  fault planes driven by free-convection?  Or, is flow driven by water-table topographic gradients  with some combination of matrix and fault controlled fluid circulation? Are these systems fundamentally transient and self-sealing due to gaunge mineralization, or , is permeability enhanced by  carbonate dissolution? To evaluate these problems we will develop a suite of 3D, single-phase, hydrothermal models using a new parallel finite element code (PGEOFE) for two field sites within the Great Basin.  We will utilize a new three-dimensional (3-D) geologic model of  the  modern Beowawe geothermal system and, with USGS colleagues, develop another 3-D geologic model of the Eocene  Carlin system; two sites with rich , isotopic, geochemical and geothermal data sets. Using LaGrit mesh generation software, these hydrogeologic models will honor known fault geometries, widths, and  stratigraphy. This mesh generation software will allow us to honor low grid aspect ratios (required by the AZTEC parallel solver package)  as the grid transitions from strata to faults while allowing sufficient refinement to minimize numerical grid dispersion when solving the heat and mass transport equations.  We will use multiple constraints including temperature profiles, shallow heat flow maps, fluid/rock ä 18O composition, and the age of hot springs deposits to constrain our models. At Beowawe, by dating pollen in the sinter terrace and adualria in exposed veins nearby we can get a sense of the timing of episodic discharges of hot fluid up the faults and on the duration of such discharges recorded by the sinter deposits. More sophisticated reactive-transport geochemical models will be developed using PFLOTRAN  to evaluate porosity-enhancing carbonate dissolution reactions and ?sealing gangue precipitation reactions in each system.

73,89834,"ABSTRACT: Studying the contributions of U.S. universities to the innovation process and National Income is important to understanding how our current economic status has been achieved and to how our international competitiveness may be maintained or increased. This project models a key component of the innovation system, particularly creation and deployment of knowledge and the flows of financial resources. The objectives of this work are to produce estimates of the contributions of various combinations of university resources, especially those of STEM units, to outcomes that represent intermediate steps in the innovation process and that contribute to NI and thus to U.S. competitiveness.The key insight of the project is that universities produce multiple outputs--for example supplies of highly skilled labor and new knowledge. The importance of this labor and technological development to the national economy has been well established in both classical and evolutionary economic theory.  In addition, universities serve as support institutions for firms and industries. Universities contribute to intermediate outcomes that stimulate innovation processes and fuel the national economy. The primary emphasis is to use data to develop new models explaining the relationships among resource deployment in U. S. universities and intermediate (to National Income growth) university outcomes, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  These are outcomes that are important to U.S. economic growth and ultimately to international competitiveness and hence the models can be used to inform science and technology investment decisions.The project builds a relational meta data base that examines the relationships among resource deployment in U.S. universities and intermediate university outcomes related to innovation and economic growth. The data for the project are derived from a variety of sources at the institutional, departmental, and individual levels. Intermediate and final outcomes include wages paid, the production of graduates, patents, licenses, start-up and spin-off companies, consultancies, joint industry-university grants and contracts, job-training programs for firms? employees, and importantly, research papers. ?Inputs? related to these outcomes include various university resources: e.g., the human resources of university faculty, staff, and student workers; the time allocations of these individuals across teaching, research and service; and the allocation of the university?s own financial resources. BROADER IMPACTS: The benefits include advancing understanding of the relationships among resource deployment in U. S. universities and intermediate university outcomes in STEM fields. These are outcomes that are important to U.S. economic growth and ultimately to international competitiveness.

74,89833,"Sulfur is an essential element in proteins, lipids, and some critical metabolites. The work proposed in this grant continues an exploration of the regulatory aspects of sulfur deprivation responses in the alga Chlamydomonas. Regulatory mutants aberrant for sulfur-deprivation responses and suppressor strains will be characterized to help identify interactions among signaling factors. Wild-type and various mutant strains will be queried with genome-wide methods for examining the transcriptome under nutrient-replete and sulfur-starvation conditions, using both microarray and Solexa sequencing technologies. Focused intellectual and technical efforts will be directed toward establishing more biochemical links between identified regulators. A diversity of protein-protein interaction assays, including the yeast two-hybrid system, the split ubiquitin and split GFP systems and the classical co-immunoprecipitation assays will facilitate these studies, providing strong insights into the regulatory circuits that control nutrient limitation responses in photosynthetic organisms. Finally, analyses will be performed to help understand the two tiers of the sulfur-deprivation response that have recently been discovered; one is protein synthesis-independent while the other is protein synthesis-dependent. In a broader sense, the proposed work will help untangle some of the complexities associated with the regulatory machinery that is required for photosynthetic cells to cope with deprivation conditions and ultimately help us understand the impact of sulfur compounds in our diets and on global weather patterns; some sulfur compounds strongly influence the quality and nutritional value of food while others have profound effects on the climate of the Earth.

75,90259,"Understanding the sensitivity of food systems to global change is limited by high uncertainties associated with the cross-scale interactions between the natural environment and the cultural landscape. Defining what might be within a suite of plausible futures requires a baseline scenario that captures the factors that are most significant in shaping decisions at different levels of governance, and which highlights the current, changing and interacting sensitivities of the system to stressors associated with both climate change and economic and cultural globalization. This project will create such a baseline by assessing the drivers and evolving social outcomes of one of the world's most important food systems: the Mexican maize system. Building on prior research that anticipates climate change will have negative impacts for Mexican maize production, and the globalization of agricultural markets is further challenging the future of maize in Mexico, an interdisciplinary team of social and biophysical scientists will investigate Mexican agricultural vulnerability in terms of a complex food system, in which individual decisions to plant or not to plant maize are hypothesized to manifest as landscape scale transformations. The research team also expects that global to regional price signals and climatic variability will affect local food production and land use outcomes differently across the Mexican landscape, as a function of regionally-specific cultural, economic, demographic, ecological and political factors. The project involves: a) a description of the changing national geography of maize production and the associated socioeconomic, institutional, and demographic correlates; b) an analysis of climate trends and variability as related to maize production, yields and water availability for irrigated farming; c) an econometric analysis of the spatial patterns of maize price volatility in three maize-producing states in order to evaluate the contribution of maize price volatility to farm-level risk and d) an evaluation of the drivers (e.g., prices and climate) and outcomes (land use, perceptions of food quality, and household maize expenditures) of maize abandonment / persistence at the farm-level through case studies in the states of Sinaloa, Mexico and Chiapas. A combination of approaches will be used, including exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), econometrics analysis (spatial, time-series, and spatial panels), agro-climatic analyses, and household livelihood surveys.This interdisciplinary and multi-method project involves experts in economic geography, econometrics, spatial analysis, livelihood assessment, climatology, agroecology and public policy in Mexico and the United States. It will provide the foundation for subsequent research on the development of scenarios of future social-ecological change and vulnerability of food security in Mexico. The project consolidates a strong international collaborative research community, involving Arizona State University, University of California Santa Barbara, the Colegio de Mexico (Mexico City), the Colegio de la Frontera Sur (Chiapas), and the National Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIFAP, Mexico City).

Graduate students from the U.S. institutions will collaborate with research counterparts in Mexico. The approaches and findings from the project will be used as case material for graduate and undergraduate courses in earth system science, regional analysis, development economics and sustainable food systems.

77,89830,"This project focuses on the study of DNA-protein complexes through single-DNA micromanipulation. Using magnetic tweezers and micropipette manipulation of DNAs attached to micron-sized particles, the dynamics of formation, mechanical properties, and catalytic function of nucleoprotein complexes will be measured. Self-assembly, activities and disassembly of these protein-DNA complexes will be studied via precise time-resolved measurement of mechanical properties, i.e. molecular lengths as a function of applied force. This simple yet versatile approach allows observation of kinetics of reactions as well as equilibrium states, for proteins that reorganize DNA structure. The project will also include development of transverse magnetic tweezer methods, including techniques for experiments on two DNA segments at once. Broader impacts of this research will be via its highly interdisciplinary nature, and by development of new biophysical techniques (transverse magnetic tweezer and combined magnetic tweezer/micropipette methods) for study of DNA-protein interactions.

78,89825,"Intelligent Merit: This study will examine and clarify for policymakers and researchers the impact of statewide policy changes that increased the availability of advanced STEM courses for a greater number of schools and students.  The proposer will analyze the extent to which the policy changes affect outcomes for all students, particularly students who are underrepresented in STEM areas.  This study, then, will provide critical information about the effectiveness of policy changes for stakeholders who have a vested interest in understanding the effects of advanced curricular programs on student enrollment in STEM courses during high school and early college.  The project will address two key research questions: 1. Who enrolls in accelerated academic programs?  What are the factors (the student and school) that influence enrollment in different accelerated and non-accelerated curricular programs? 2. Do accelerated academic programs increase students? STEM coursetaking in high school and during their first year of postsecondary school (Grade 13)?  Do some programs increase STEM coursetaking more than others?  Do these programs reduce gaps in STEM coursetaking among historically underrepresented students and their peers?The proposer will use a mixed method approach to address the research questions that includes a quantitative analysis of extant longitudinal data in the state of Florida and a qualitative assessment of non-statistical factors through site visits to schools.  Ten years of quantitative data from the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) will serve as the main source of information the proposer will use to study the characteristics of both students and schools.  The FLDOE dataset includes a rich array of high school and postsecondary data (e.g. transcripts; dual enrollment and achievement data in these courses; regular 1-12 grades school test scores; demographic data; poverty index information).  Two sets of school site visits will be conducted in the state?s major urban centers as well as small suburban high schools to provide insights not captured through quantitative analysis.

Absent such information it is difficult to reason about the structural nature of the conflict between attackers and defenders.Traditionally, obtaining information about the critical economic factors in Internet attacks is difficult because such information is only visible to the attacker themselves.  Our research is focused on sidestepping this issue by infiltrating the technical infrastructure ? the botnets themselves ? used by Internet miscreants.  Our technique, called ?distribution infiltration? provides a means to directly quantify key aspects of spam and phishing campaigns as well as to measure the impact of defenses on an economic footing (i.e., their impact on the profitability of e-crime).  Our research will both refine these methodologies and produce concrete data for developing economic-based threat models of computer security.",abstracting; base; Computer Security; Conflict (Psychology); Crime; Data; Economic Factors; Economics; foot; Incentives; Infiltration; Internet; Mails; Measures; Methodology; Modeling; Motivation; Nature; phishing; Probability; Research; Research Infrastructure; Sales; spam; Techniques,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: CT-M: UNDERSTANDING AND EXPLOITING ECONOMIC INCENTIVES IN INTERNET-BASED SCAMS,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2011,2008,500000.0

82,89806,"Layer-8 attacks (e.g., spam and phishing) are launched from a malicious service platform, e.g., botnet, which consists of a large number of infected machines (or bots). Such an attack platform relies on lower-layer network services to achieve efficiency, robustness, and stealth in communication and attack activities. These services include look-up (e.g., DNS), hosting (e.g., Web servers), and transport (e.g., BGP).The main research goals and approaches of the CLEANSE project are:         1. Control-plane monitoring. Much of the infrastructure for mounting layer-8 attacks involves abuse of the control plane in core network services (e.g., DNS and BGP).The CLEANSE project develops control-plane anomaly detection sensors that are distributed, online, and real-time.         2. Data-plane monitoring. The project develops new and general network anomaly detection algorithms based on traffic sampling and clustering for monitoring high-speed traffic.         3. Improved security auditing capabilities. The CLEANSE project develops packet  tagging/tainting  techniques to enable tracking and clustering of network traffic flows (e.g., that are generated by the same bot program). The project also develops improved traffic sampling capabilities that are attack-aware and distributed network-wide.By focusing on monitoring of core network services, the CLEANSE framework can detect future layer-8 attacks and new forms of large-scale malware infections. The project also creates educational contents, including new textbooks and on-line course materials, which directly benefit from the research activities. The CLEANSE project team also work with industry partners (including the ISPs) to organize focused workshops that bring together researchers from academia and practitioners from the industry/ISP, government, and law enforcement agencies to foster the exchange of ideas, data, and technologies.",Academia; Algorithms; base; Communication; Data; Detection; Educational workshop; Fostering; Future; Goals; Government; improved; Industry; industry partner; Infection; Internet; Law Enforcement; Monitor; Pathway Analysis; phishing; programs; Research; Research Activity; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Sampling; Secure; Secure; Security; sensor; Services; spam; Techniques; Technology; Textbooks; Time; trafficking; Work,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: CT-L: CLEANSE: CROSS-LAYER LARGE-SCALE EFFICIENT ANALYSIS OF NETWORK ACTIVITIES TO SECURE THE INTERNET,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2012,2008,500000.0
83,89802,"Preliminary analysis of the storms preceding the recent Eastern Iowa floods have revealed that there was no single, extreme storm that was responsible for the flood conditions. Instead, the effect of a sequence of storms compounded, affecting locations along the larger rivers in the basin. We propose to investigate: (1) the link between the characteristics of the storms (or group of storms) that caused the floods along the Iowa River; (2) how storm properties are related to flooding as a function of basin scale, following insights from a new geophysical theory of floods; and (3) whether the methodologies developed here can be extended to other large basins using the Hydro?]NEXRAD radar?]rainfall dataset.The urgency of our proposal lies in the pressing need to understand the causes and far?]reaching effects of the 2008 Iowa flood. Undoubtedly, local authorities and communities will be looking to our research facility, IIHR?]Hydroscience and Engineering at The University of Iowa, to analyze the flooding events and offer guidance in adopting measures to prevent or mitigate the effect of future floods. While this proposal addresses a very recent, ongoing natural disaster, it is grounded in our collective, sustained work on the geophysical theory of floods.Intellectual Merit: Over the past 20 years, scientists at the University of Colorado, The University of Iowa, and other institutions have collaborated on a new theory of floods. Recent advances in this theory have revealed the important role played by the self?]similar structure of the river network in determining the magnitude of peak flows. In particular, flow aggregation patterns imposed by the presence of the river network provide explicit guidelines to understand the genesis of extreme flooding events similar to the ones in Eastern Iowa in June 2008. This framework allows rapid and physically meaningful analysis of flood events across a range of spatial scales, without the need to resort to rainfall?]runoff model calibration.Broader Impacts: This work could potentially change the concept of Probable Maximum Precipitation and Probable Maximum Flood and their use in engineering design.

The context of inquiry for this project will be the six communities currently being evaluated by the Department of Homeland Security to host the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF). The design incorporates public opinion survey methodology, in-depth interviews with stakeholders and media content analysis. This multi-faceted design will provide insights into both successful and failed communication strategies aimed at engaging local residents, and help the research team develop a better understanding of how public deliberation can help or undermine efforts to meaningfully connect with various publics on risk-related issues. The research will contribute to understanding the social amplification an attenuation of risk. In particular, the PI is interested in two levels of outcome variables. At a first level, the PI will explore how the interplay of media coverage, interpersonal channels, and predispositional factors shape feelings of trust toward various stakeholders, including executive and regulatory bodies at the state and federal level, local agencies and governments, and other regional players.

85,90305,"We propose applying transcendence techniques to curves and abelian varieties in a family and to classical period maps to deduce transcendence properties for functions which are solutions of a Picard-Fuchs equation. This leads naturally to considering the distribution of points with special properties on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. These special properties can be interpreted as meaning that the points lie on the intersection of the subvariety with certain Shimura subvarieties. This leads to studying open conjectures in the theory of Shimura varieties. We also propose an approach independent of these conjectures which would involve studying the locus of ``irreducible'' points on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. We propose developing a transcendence theory for more general varieties in a family, and for more general period maps as well as for periods of higher order forms. A fundamental problem in transcendence theory is the determination of the exceptional set of a function, that is the set of algebraic numbers at which the function assumes algebraic values. A classical result is that the exceptional set of the exponential function consists only of the origin. This implies that e and pi are transcendental. In previous work, we determine the exceptional set of the classical hypergemetric function and its generalization to several complex variables by relating these functions to families of algebraic curves. We intend to extend this work to a wider class of functions related to more general families of algebraic curves and varieties.",Complex; Equation; Family; Maps; Property; Solutions; Techniques; theories; Work,TRANSCENDENCE ON VARIETIES IN FAMILIES,NSF,NSF,9/15/2008,8/31/2012,2008,120943.0

88,89780,"Scheduling policies are explicitly (or implicitly) used everywhere that resources need to be allocated, and resultantly the theory of scheduling has a long and varied history.  Out of this large body of work, two distinct research communities have emerged and, unfortunately, researchers in each community are often not aware of results from the other community.  One set of researchers from the theoretical computer science and optimization communities has focused on providing competitive guarantees for scheduling disciplines in the worst-case environment.  A different set of researchers, from the performance modeling and applied probability communities, has focused on providing exact performance analyses of scheduling policies in stochastic/probabilistic environments.  Each of these approaches have specific advantages and disadvantages when carried out on their own.  The aim of this project is to develop techniques that can achieve the  best of both worlds , i.e., to combine ideas from each community to arrive at results neither has been able to achieve alone.  Specifically, the goal of this project is to develop approaches that combine worst-case results and techniques with qualitative and quantitative techniques for analyzing stochastic models, thus combining the breadth of models where worst-case results can be applied with the real-world applicability of stochastic analysis. This is an ambitious goal, but one that will open up a new avenue of research in an important, well established field.  If successful, it can bring together ideas from two distinct communities which attack similar problems with very different techniques, and thus is likely to identify new scheduling disciplines that will impact system design in practice.

90,89777,"This research develops measures of firms? resources devoted to the development of new products and business models in the financial services industry, an activity called ?finance R&D.?  The work helps fill a vast gap in our knowledge of the investment and innovation process for a large and important sector of economic activity in the United States. Traditional R&D spending captures the cost of the ?work done? by scientists and engineers because the innovation process in manufacturing is well understood to originate in a laboratory.  But where do financial innovations, such as credit default swaps, derivatives, electronic payment systems, ATMs, and the like originate?  A recent review of the empirical literature on financial innovation (Frame and White 2004) suggests little is known about the process.The novel aspect of our research will be to further develop available measures of intangible investment and capital by exploiting Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employer-based datasets on employment and wages by detailed occupation and industry. The BLS data will be used in combination with information obtained from semi structured interviews with industry executives to build estimates of the ?work done? by the employees (or contractors) who conduct the design and development activity in (or for) financial services firms.  The interviews will leverage the Conference Board?s extensive network of business contacts to obtain the required information as well as to generally expand our knowledge of the innovation process in financial services industries.

First, it is helping both NSF grantees and many other related educational projects to better serve their specific audiences by focusing less on recreating technical developments and focusing more on serving as sites for teaching, mentoring, and supporting research of large numbers of STEM students and teachers. Second, it is establishing a broad-based community engagement process to foster creativity, innovation, and contributions to the design and use of next-generation educational cyberinfrastructure and interactive learning applications. Third, it is instrumenting the NSDL infrastructure to collect detailed (anonymized) usage and behavioral data, providing the basis for next-generation research into: personalized learning, educationally-informed recommendation engines, formation and evolution of educational social networks, and other areas where large volumes of user-generated actions and activities are needed.",Area; base; Behavioral; Communities; Community Health Education; Creativeness; Data; design; Development; Education; Educational process of instructing; Ensure; Evolution; Fostering; Foundations; Individual; innovation; Institution; instrument; Knowledge; Learning; Mentors; next generation; Process; Recommendation; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Support; Resources; Services; Site; Social Network; Students; teacher; tool; Vision,NSDL TECHNICAL NETWORK SERVICES: A CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORM FOR STEM EDUCATION,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2012,2008,7848312.0

Four primary goals guide the work of the center:1) Mobilization: to facilitate the flow of information and communications across NSDL projects to build community capacity, set priorities, and identify emerging issues so that the community can exploit its opportunities and address its challenges collectively.2) Synthesis: to mine the collective knowledge and experience of the community and synthesize the work of NSDL projects to inform community best practices.3) Dissemination: to place resources and research into the hands of educators through targeted outreach activities, by bundling specific products and services to meet users' needs, and by distributing NSDL products and services through trusted dissemination channels.4) Analysis and Evaluation: to create and foster a culture of data gathering and interpretation to support the analysis of needs and trends so that NSDL can create more effective products and services that meet the demands of STEM learners. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its core strategies of: i) brokering partnerships and opportunities on behalf of the community; ii) monitoring trends and practices; iii) promoting and advocating for NSDL; iv) customizing and contextualizing NSDL resources; v) putting NSDL in the path of users; and vi) systematic data gathering to inform short-term decision-making and long-term sustainability planning.

93,90332,"The advent of computer and digital information technologies and there development have greatly changed the world we live in. Today digital technologies are everywhere in our lives. A key step that makes all those technologies possible is to convert analog data into digital ones, a process known analog-to-digital conversion, or A/D conversion. With demand for higher precision and more cutting-edge technologies, the mathematics of A/D conversion algorithms plays a key role in this quest. The research proposed in this proposal focuses mainly on the mathematics and algorithms of A/D conversion. Given that analog devices are to different degrees imprecise by nature, robustness is extremely important if high precision is desired. The proposal will focus on robust A/D conversion algorithms. In this proposal the PI will address two of the main sources of imprecisions: imprecise quantizations and imprecise multiplications. The proposed encoders are the first encoders to be completely robust against quantizer and multiplier imprecisions. The PI proposes to study both the algorithms and the mathematical questions that arise from the study. The PI also studies ways the encoders can be extended and refined, along with many related and often challenging mathematical problems. The core of this project is a novel class of analog-to-digital conversion algorithms. These algorithms have the advantage that they are robust against quantization errors (imprecisions) and multiplication imprecisions. The novelty of these A/D algorithms comes from the use of Golden Ratio based expansions of real numbers related to the Fibonacci numbers. More general algorithms involve a class of algebraic integers and matrix encoders. The PI and his collaborators have already built a circuit of an A/D converter based on one of our algorithms, which has yielded outstanding result. A main objective of this proposal is to study these algorithms in greater depth, particularly concerning the stability and robustness of these algorithms. Equally important is that the study of these A/D algorithms has raised a number of interesting and challenging mathematical questions. Graduate students will be involved in the project.

94,89764,"The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that garnet-bearing amphibolites and pelitic schists from the northwest U.S. Cordillera preserve a record of late Mesoproterozoic high pressure metamorphism that can be attributed to significant crustal thickening along the western margin of Laurentia before or during the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. To this end a research team from Washington State University, West Virginia University, and University of Idaho are undertaking an integrated geochronologic and metamorphic analysis of garnet-bearing metamorphic assemblages in the northwest U.S. Cordillera in order to: 1) determine the ages of metamorphism using Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd geochronology of garnets and U-Th-Pb geochronology of monazites in order to determine the extent of Proterozoic metamorphism throughout the northwest U.S. Cordillera; 2) establish the pressure-temperature conditions of mineral growth in these metamorphic assemblages; 3) compare the results from the garnet and monazite chronometers and integrate this information with the metamorphic fabrics using detailed petrography; and 4) link both the geochronologic and pressure-temperature information to the penetrative deformational fabrics preserved in the rocks. Establishment of a linkage between late Mesoproterozoic metamorphism and the high temperature, high-pressure assemblages that exist in these rocks over a considerable area will show that a major period of crustal thickening during convergent tectonism occurred on the western margin of Laurentia at the end of the Mesoproterozoic. The presence of an approximately one billion year old contractional belt in the northwestern U.S., if confirmed, would imply that the history of metamorphism and deformation in the Cordillera is more complicated than previously appreciated. These results would provide important piercing points for late Mesoproterozoic tectonic reconstructions. In particular, results of this project will provide additional constraints on correlations of western Laurentia with other cratonal fragments such as Australia, Siberia, Antarctica, and China and will ultimately impact various reconstructions of Rodinia.The Grenville orogeny was an important event that substantially modified the North American continent approximately one billion years ago. The metamorphic rocks produced in this event can be found in wide belt that extends from eastern Canada to southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. Preliminary geochronological data yielded the unexpected result that metamorphism of this age also occurred in the northwestern U.S. To confirm these data, this project is using new geochronological methods to determine the ages of minerals that are commonly produced during the metamorphism that occurs during mountain belt formation. If the preliminary results are born out, current understanding of the nature of the Grenville event will require revision. Evidence for a billion year old metamorphic event in the northwest U.S. would also require modification of current ideas about the configuration of continents at that time.",Age; American; Antarctica; Area; Australia; Canada; China; Data; Event; Goals; Growth; High temperature of physical object; Idaho; Link; Methods; Mexico; Minerals; Modification; Nature; Northwestern United States; pressure; reconstruction; Recording of previous events; Research; Siberia; Temperature; Testing; Textiles; Time; Universities; Washington; West Virginia,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: CONSTRAINING THE TIMING AND NATURE OF PROTEROZOIC METAMORPHISM IN THE NORTHWEST U.S. CORDILLERA,NSF,NSF,7/1/2008,6/30/2010,2008,45588.0

96,90351,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports theoretical research and education on novel quantum phases in orbital and large spin systems with cold atoms. The research explores novel quantum phases and emergent symmetries with cold atoms which are not accessible in usual solid state systems and provides guidance for new experiments. The application of symmetry principles is essential for this project which not only deepens our understanding but also provides the guidance to new discoveries.  A variety of methods in condensed matter physics and field theory are employed, including bosonization, the renormalization group, the large-N method, the self-consistent mean-field theory, and band structure calculations.The first research topic is the study of novel quantum phases in high orbital bands in optical lattices. The p-orbital bosons exhibit complex-valued many-body wave functions characterized by the formation of on-site orbital angular momentum moments. The research encompasses orbital superfluidity in various lattices which exhibit collinear ordering (e.g., staggered and stripe-like), non-collinear ordering, and ''frustrated'' distributions of orbital angular momentum moments. For fermionic orbital systems, the research will focus on the honeycomb lattice, which is a p_xy-orbital counterpart of graphene. The second research topic is the study of large spin physics with cold fermions.  Particular attention is paid to spin-3/2 systems which possess a generic SO(5) symmetry without fine tuning.  The symmetry gives rise to important consequences such as the protected degeneracy in collective excitations, new properties of the quantum Monte-Carlo sign problem, the quintet pairing superfluidity, and the four-fermion quartetting superfluidity. Planned investigations include quantum magnetism in the spin-3/2 systems and other large spin systems as well, such as the pseudospin-1 systems and the spin-5/2 systems.  The research will provide new ideas on exotic orbital superfluidity, orbital exchange physics, and emergent quantum magnetic states. It also suggests new directions for future experiments. Knowledge gained from this research deepens our understanding on strong correlation physics in both cold atom and condensed matter systems.This research lies at the interface between condensed matter and cold atom physics and will benefit both fields. Students will receive training in the application of the symmetry principles and the research will stimulate students to develop broad interests and skills in the frontiers of strongly correlated systems. Aspects of the research, particularly the underlying theoretical techniques, form part of the subject matter of the advanced physics courses being developed by the PI at his university.NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports theoretical research and education that seeks to predict new states of matter composed of ultracold atoms in artificial crystals of light. Researchers have found that atoms can be trapped in modulated laser beams much like electrons are trapped in the force fields of atomic nuclei in a crystalline solid. Electrons have two internal configurations; these are related to their magnetic properties. Atoms can have many more internal configurations, leading to possible new states of matter that have no counterparts in conventional materials, but have intriguing properties and may display interesting phenomena. The research develops theories to explain the novel quantum mechanical properties of these cold atoms in crystals of light. The theories provide guidance for new experiments, deepening our understanding of quantum physics and states of matter and leading to new discoveries.  This is fundamental research that lies at the interface of atomic and condensed matter physics. However, systems of cold atoms are intriguing and may hold possibilities for future technologies. Conspicuous among these is the potential to realize powerful new methods of computation based on the principles of quantum mechanics. This research lies at the interface between condensed matter and cold atom physics and will benefit both fields.

97,90352,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports theoretical research and education in a variety of subfields of statistical mechanics. This work is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences. The central theme of the effort  is a better understanding of the properties of macroscopic systems originating in the collective behavior of their microscopic constituents. The methods used range from exact mathematical analysis to computer simulations. These approaches  bridge the gap between rigorous results and applications.Research topics employed by PI and collaborators are varied.  Using mesoscopic free energy functionals allows investigation of periodic states, wetting in mixtures and droplet formation in supersaturated vapor. An ongoing effort continues on fluctuations and large deviations in nonequilibrium stationary states and partial currents. This includes cases where the hydrodynamic scaling is inadequate. Significant advance continue in fundamental studies such as  establishing Fourier?s law of heat conduction in open systems with anharmonic interactions. In quantum statistical physics,  the study of  subsystems of large quantum systems leads to understanding of when these systems have density matrices given by canonical Gibbs measures. In some cases, such as the study of ionization of model quantum systems in time periodic fields,  there are applications to laser induced transitions in atoms and molecules. Beyond physics, researchers also  apply statistical mechanical methods to the mathematical study of epidemics taking into account correlations as well as saturation effects on networks. Extension of these techniques to models of population dynamics and ecology involves derivation of reaction-diffusion equations via scaling limits and these are planned investigations.The  research activities are  highly interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, mathematicians, chemists and those working in theoretical areas of the biological and social sciences. The expected applications are in material science, complex fluids and in biological systems. The project also includes the organization of two conferences every year in which both core subjects and new developments in statistical mechanics are discussed in a collegial atmosphere. Graduate students, postdocs and minority scientists are involved and present talks on their work and interact with established researchers in the field. The conferences also serve as an opportunity for professional networking  and can lead to new collaborations.

98,90009,"Tomova's research centers on Heegaard splittings of 3-dimensional manifolds and bridge surfaces for knots in manifolds.  Given a knot in a closed 3-manifold, a bridge surface is a surface that decomposes the manifold into handlebodies and also cuts the knot into simple arcs. In the last year and a half Tomova has proven several important results about the behavior of bridge surfaces. She intends to extend and generalize her results and apply her work to several open problems in the area.With the discovery of the DNS molecule and the recent advent of string theory, the study of knots has come to the forefront of modern science. Knot Theory is a subarea of Topology which studies the properties of knotted strings and is the main area of interest of Maggy Tomova. Her study of knots also requires an understanding of 3-manifolds, objects that locally look like 3-dimensional space.",3-Dimensional; Area; Behavior; Complement; interest; Property; Research; Science; Surface; theories; Work,SPECIAL SURFACES IN KNOT COMPLEMENTS,NSF,NSF,8/1/2008,5/31/2011,2008,40709.0
99,90010,"Phylogenetic trees, which depict the genealogical relationships of organisms to each other, are a key tool for organizing and analyzing information about biological diversity. Trees are used by many researchers in comparative biology and the demand for them is high. The proposed research will take advantage of the phenomenal breadth of data in the GenBank molecular sequence database (currently including sequences from 185,000 species, or some 10% of all species known to science) to build an electronic repository of one billion phylogenetic trees. The goal of this research is to build a very large number of phylogenetic trees and then construct simple search and retrieval tools to match these trees to any query list of species in which a user may be interested.The primary impact of this research will be outside of the phylogenetics research community. Users of phylogenetic trees span most areas of modern biology: epidemiologists, genomicists, functional morphologists, conservation biologists, and community ecologists, to name a few. A repository of molecular phylogenies built using a consistent methodology, and satisfying prescribed minimal levels of statistical confidence, will provide users a level of consistency needed for strong inferences within and between comparative biological studies.",Area; Biodiversity; Biological; Biology; Communities; comparative; Comparative Biology; Data; Electronics; Epidemiologist; Genbank; Goals; interest; Methodology; Molecular; molecular sequence database; Names; Organism; Phylogenetic Analysis; Phylogeny; repository; Research; Research Personnel; Retrieval; Science; tool; Trees,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: PHYLOGENETIC TREES FOR COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY,NSF,NSF,10/1/2008,9/30/2011,2008,450000.0
